APRIL 

IPRIL, April, 
Laugh thy girlish laughter; 
Then, the moment after. 
Weep thy girlish tears! 
April, that mine ears 
Like a lover greetest, 
If I tell thee, sweetest, 
All my hopes and fears, 

April, April, 
Laugh thy golden laughter. 
But, the moment after. 
Weep thy golden tears.

THE FIDDLER OF DOONEY 

I HEN I play on my fiddle in Dooney, 
Folk dance like a wave of the sea ; 
My cousin is priest in Kilvamet, 
My brother in Moharabuiee. 

I passed my brother and cousin: 

They read in their books of prayer; 

I read in my book of songs 
I bought at the Sligo fair. 

When we come at the end of time, 

To Peter sitting in state. 
He will smile on the three old spirits, 

But call me first through the gate; 

For the good are always the merry, 

Save by an evil chance, 
And the merry love the fiddle. 

And the merry love to dance: 

<2> 



RECENT POETRY 

And when the folk there spy me, 
They will all come up to me. 

With "Here is the fiddler of Dooney!" 
And dance like a wave of the sea.

THE LAKE ISLE OF INNISFREE 

WILL arise and go now, and go to 

Innisfree, 
And a small cabin build there, of clay 
and wattles made; 
Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for 
the honey bee, 

And live alone in the bee-loud glade. 

And I shall have some peace there, for 

peace comes dropping slow. 
Dropping from the veils of the morning to 

where the cricket sings; 
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a 
purple glow. 

And evening full of the linnet's 
wings. 

I will arise and go now, for always, night 

and day, 
I hear lake-water lapping with low sounds 

by the shore;

RECENT POETRY 

While I stand on the roadway, or on the 
pavements grey, 

I hear it in the deep heart's core.

CRADLE-SONG 

'ROM groves of spice, 
O'er fields of rice, 
Athwart the lotus-stream, 
I bring for you, 
Aglint with dew, 
A little lovely dream. 

Sweet, shut your eyes. 

The wild fire-flies 

Dance through the fairy neem; ^ 

From the poppy-bole 

For you I stole 
A little lovely dream. 

Dear eyes, good-night. 

In golden light 

The stars around you gleam; 

On you I press 

With soft caress 
A little lovely dream.

THE DONKEY 

HEN fishes flew and forests walked 
And figs grew upon thorn, 
Some moment when the moon was 
blood 
Then surely I was born; 

With monstrous head and sickening cry 

And ears like errant wings, 
The devil's walking parody 

On all four-footed things. 

The tattered outlaw of the earth, 

Of ancient crooked will; 
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb, 

I keep my secret still. 

Fools! For I also had my hour; 

One far fierce hour and sweet: 
There was a shout about my ears. 

And palms before my feet.

THE EARLY MORNING 

!'HE moon on the one hand, the dawn 
on the other: 
The moon is my sister, the dawn is 
my brother. 
The moon on my left and the dawn on my 

right. 
My brother, good morning: my sister, good 
night.

THE SOUTH COUNTRY 

I HEN I am living in the Midlands 
That are sodden and unkind, 
I light my lamp in the evening: 
My work is left behind ; 
And the great hills of the South Country 
Come back into my mind. 

The great hills of the South Country 

They stand along the sea; 
And it's there walking in the high woods 

That I could wish to be, 
And the men that were boys when I was a 
boy 

Walking along with me. 

The men that live in North England 

I saw them for a day: 
Their hearts are set upon the waste fells, 

Their skies are fast and grey; 
From their castle-walls a man may see 

The mountains far away. 
<9> 



AN ANTHOLOGY OF 

The men that live in West England 

They see the Severn strong, 
A-rolling on rough water brown 

Light aspen leaves along. 
They have the secret of the Rocks, 

And the oldest kind of song. 

But the men that live in the South Country 

Are the kindest and most wise, 
They get their laughter from the loud surf, 

And the faith in their happy eyes 
Comes surely from our Sister the Spring 

When over the sea she flies; 
The violets suddenly bloom at her feet, 

She blesses us with surprise. 

I never get between the pines 

But I smell the Sussex air; 
Nor I never come on a belt of sand 

But my home is there. 
And along the sky the line of the Downs 

So noble and so bare. 

A lost thing could I never find, 
Nor a broken thing mend : 
-C10> 



RECENT POETRY 

And I fear I shall be all alone 

When I get towards the end. 
Who will be there to comfort me 

Or who will be my friend? 

I will gather and carefully make my friends 
Of the men of the Sussex Weald, 

They watch the stars from silent folds, 
They stiffly plough the field. 

By them and the God of the South Country 
My poor soul shall be healed. 

If I ever become a rich man. 

Or if ever I grow to be old, 
I will build a house with deep thatch 

To shelter me from the cold. 
And there shall the Sussex songs be sung 

And the story of Sussex told. 

I will hold my house in the high wood 

Within a walk of the sea. 
And the men that were boys when I was a 
boy 

Shall sit and drink with me.

SEA FEVER 

MUST go down to the seas again, to 

the lonely sea and the sky, 
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star 
to steer her by; 
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song 

and the white sail's shaking, 
And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a 
grey dawn breaking. 

I must go down to the seas again, for the 

call of the running tide 
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not 

be denied; 
And all I ask is a windy day with the white 

clouds flying, 
And the flung spray and the blown spume, 

and the sea-gulls crying. 

I must go down to the seas again, to the 
vagrant gipsy life, 

-C12> 



RECENT POETRY 

To the gull's way and the whale's way where 
the wind's like a whetted knife; 

And all I ask is a merry yam from a laugh-

And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when 
the long trick's over.

TEWKESBURY ROAD 

'T is good to be out on the road, and 
going one knows not where, 
Going through meadow and village, 
one knows not whither nor why; 
Through the grey light drift of the dust, 

in the keen cool rush of the air. 
Under the flying white clouds, and the 
broad blue lift of the sky. 

And to halt at the chattering brook, in the 

tall green fern at the brink 
Where the harebell grows, and the gorse, 

and the foxgloves purple and white ; 
Where the shy-eyed delicate deer come 

down in a troop to drink 
When the stars are mellow and large at the 

coming on of the night. 

0, to feel the beat of the rain, and the 
homely smell of the earth, 



RECENT POETRY 

Is a tune for the blood to jig to, a joy past 

power of words; 
And the blessed green comely meadows are 

all a-ripple with mirth 
At the noise of the lambs at play and the 

dear wild cry of the birds. 

JOHN MASEFIELD

THE WEST WIND 

'T'S a warm wind, the west wind, full 
of birds' cries; 
I never hear the west wind but tears 
are in my eyes. 
For it comes from the west lands, the old 

brown hills. 
And April's in the west wind, and daffodils. 

It's a fine land, the west land, for hearts as 

tired as mine, 
Apple orchards blossom there, and the air's 

like wine. 
There is cool green grass there, where men 

may lie at rest, 
And the thrushes are in song there, fluting 

from the nest. 

"Will you not come home, brother? 

You have been long away. 
It's April, and blossom time, and white is 

the spray: 

<16> 



RECENT POETRY 

And bright is the sun, brother, and warm 

is the rain, 
Will you not come home, brother, home to 

us again? 

The young com is green, brother, where the 

rabbits run; 
It's blue sky, and white clouds, and warm 

rain and sun. 
It's song to a man's soul, brother, fire to a 

man's brain, 
To hear the wild bees and see the merry 

spring again. 

Larks are singing in the west, brother, 

above the green wheat. 
So will you not come home, brother, and 

rest your tired feet? 
I've a balm for bruised hearts, brother, 

sleep for aching eyes," 
Says the warm wind, the west wind, full of 

birds' cries. 

It's the white road westwards is the road I 
must tread 

-C17> 



RECENT POETRY 

To the green grass, the cool grass, and rest 

for heart and head, 
To the violets and the brown brooks and the 

thrushes' song 
In the fine land, the west land, the land 

where I belong.

A BALLAD OF THE CAPTAINS 

(HERE are now the Captains 

Of the narrow ships of old — 
Who with valiant souls went seeking 
For the Fabled Fleece of Gold; 
In the clouded Dusk of Ages, 

In the Dawn of History, 
When the ringing songs of Homer 
First re-echoed o'er the Sea? 

Oh, the Captains lie a-sleeping 
Where great iron hulls are sweeping 

Out of Suez in their pride; 
And they hear not, and they heed not. 
And they know not, and they need not 

In their deep graves far and wide. 

Where are now the Captains 

Who went blindly through the Strait, 
With a tribute to Poseidon, 

A libation poured to Fate? 
They were heroes giant-hearted, 

That with Terrors, told and sung, 



AN ANTHOLOGY OF 

Like blindfolded lions grappled, 

When the World was strange and young. 

Oh, the Captains brave and daring. 
With their grim old crews are faring 

Where our guiding beacons gleam; 
And the homeward liners o'er them — 
All the charted seas before them — 

Shall not wake them as they dream. 

Where are now the Captains 

From bold Nelson back to Drake, 
Who came drumming up the Channel, 

Haling prizes in their wake? 
Where are England's fighting Captains 

Who, with battle flags unfurled, 
Went a-rieving all the rievers 

O'er the waves of all the world? 

Oh, these Captains, all confiding 
In the strong right hand, are biding 

In the margins, on the Main; 
They are shining bright in story, 
They are sleeping deep in glory, 

On the silken lap of Fame. 
-C20> 



RECENT POETRY 

Where are now the Captains 

Who regarded not the tears 
Of the captured Christian maidens 

Carried, weeping, to Algiers? 
Yes, the swarthy Moorish Captains, 

Storming wildly 'cross the Bay, 
With a dead hidalgo's daughter 

As a dower for the Dey? 

Oh, those cruel Captains never 
Shall sweet lovers more dissever, 

On their forays as they roll; 
Or the mad Dons curse them vainly, 
As their baffled ships, ungainly, 

Heel them, jeering, to the Mole. 

Where are now the Captains 

Of those racing, roaring days. 
Who of knowledge and of courage. 

Drove the clippers on their ways — 
To the furthest ounce of pressure, 

To the latest stitch of sail, 
'Carried on' before the tempest 

Till the waters lapped the rail? 

-C21> 



RECENT POETRY 

Oh, the merry, manly skippers 
Of the traders and the clippers, 

They are sleeping East and West, 
And the brave blue seas shall hold 

them. 
And the oceans five enfold them 

In the havens where they rest. 

Where are now the Captains 

Of the gallant days agone? 
They are biding in their places. 

And the Great Deep bears no traces 
Of their good ships passed and gone. 

They are biding in their places. 
Where the light of God's own grace is, 

And the Great Deep thunders on. 

Yea, with never port to steer for, 
And with never storm to fear for. 

They are waiting wan and white. 
And they hear no more the calling 
Of the watches, or the falling 

Of the sea rain in the night.

ARABIA 

'AR are the shades of Arabia, 

Where the Princes ride at noon, 
'Mid the verdurous vales and thick- 
ets, 
Under the ghost of the moon; 
And so dark is that vauhed purple 

Flowers in the forest rise 
And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom 
stars 
Pale in the noonday skies. 

Sweet is the music of Arabia 

In my heart, when out of dreams 
I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn 

Descry her gliding streams; 
Hear her strange lutes on the green banks 

Ring loud with the grief and delight 
Of the demi-silked, dark-haired Musicians 

In the brooding silence of night. 



-C23> 



RECENT POETRY 

They haunt me — her lutes and her forests; 

No beauty on earth I see 
But shadowed with that dream recalls 

Her loveliness to me: 
Still eyes look coldly upon me. 

Cold voices whisper and say — 
"He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia, 

They have stolen his wits away."

FULL MOON 

NE night as Dick lay half asleep, 
Into his drowsy eyes 
A great still light began to creep 
From out the silent skies. 
It was the lovely moon's, for when 

He raised his dreamy head. 
Her rays of silver filled the pane 
And streamed across his bed. 
So, for awhile, each gazed at each — 

Dick and the solemn moon — 
Till, climbing slowly on her way. 
She vanished, and was gone.

NOD 

OFTLY along the road of evening, 
In a twilight dim with rose, 
Wrinkled with age, and drenched 
with dew. 
Old Nod, the shepherd, goes. 



His drowsy flock streams on before him. 
Their fleeces charged with gold. 
To where the sun's last beam leans low 
On Nod the shepherd's fold. 

The hedge is quick and green with briar, 
From their sand the conies creep; 
And all the birds that fly in heaven 
Flock singing home to sleep. 

His lambs outnumber a noon's roses, 
Yet, when night's shadows fall. 
His blind old sheep-dog, Slumber-soon, 
Misses not one of all. 

-C26> 



RECENT POETRY 

His are the quiet steeps of dreamland, 
The waters of no-more-pain, 
His ram's bell rings 'neath an arch of stars, 
"Rest, rest, and rest again."

THE SONG OF THE MAD PRINCE 

HO said, "Peacock Pie"? 

The old King to the sparrow: 
Who said, "Crops are ripe"? 
Rust to the harrow: 
Who said, "Where sleeps she now? 

Where rests she now her head. 
Bathed in eve's loveliness"? 
That's what I said. 

Who said, "Ay, mum's the word"? 

Sexton to willow: 
Who said, "Green dusk for dreams, 

Moss for a pillow"? 
Who said, "All Time's delight 

Hath she for narrow bed; 
Life's troubled bubble broken"? 

That's what I said.

A DEAD HARVEST 

IN KENSINGTON GARDENS 

'LONG the graceless grass of town 
They rake the rows of red and 
brown, — 
Dead leaves, unlike the rows of hay 
Delicate, touched with gold and grey, 
Raked long ago and far away. 

A narrow silence in the park. 
Between the lights a narrow dark. 
One street rolls on the north; and one, 
Muffled, upon the south doth run; 
Amid the mist the work is done. 

A futile crop! for it the fire 
Smoulders, and, for a stack, a pyre. 
So go the town's lives on the breeze. 
Even as the sheddings of the trees; 
Bosom nor barn is filled with these.

NOVEMBER BLUE 

The golden tint of the electric lights seems to 
give a complementary colour to the air in the 
early evening. 

Essay on London 

HEAVENLY colour, London town 
Has blurred it from her skies; 
And, hooded in an earthly brown, 
Unheaven'd the city lies. 
No longer standard-like this hue 

Above the broad road flies; 
Nor does the narrow street the blue 
Wear, slender pennon-wise. 

But when the gold and silver lamps 

Colour the London dew, 
And, misted by the winter damps, 

The shops shine bright anew — 
Blue comes to earth, it walks the street. 

It dyes the wide air through; 
A mimic sky about their feet, 

The throng go crowned with blue.

THE SHEPHERDESS 

:HE walks — the lady of my delight — 
A shepherdess of sheep. 
Her flocks are thoughts. She keeps 
them white; 
She guards them from the steep; 
She feeds them on the fragrant height, 
And folds them in for sleep. 

She roams maternal hills and bright, 

Dark valleys safe and deep. 
Into that tender breast at night 

The chastest stars may peep. 
She walks — the lady of my delight — 

A shepherdess of sheep. 

She holds her little thoughts in sight, 
Though gay they run and leap. 

She is so circumspect and right; 
She has her soul to keep. 

She walks — the lady of my delight — 
A shepherdess of sheep.

THE DEAD 

I LOW out, you bugles, over the rich 
Dead! 
There's none of these so lonely 
and poor of old, 
But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than 
gold. 
These laid the world away; poured out the 

red 
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to 
be 
Of work and joy, and that unhoped se- 
rene. 
That men call age; and those who would 
have been. 
Their sons, they gave, their immortality. 

Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for 
our dearth, 
Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and 
Pain.

THE GREAT LOVER 

HAVE been so great a lover: filled 
my days 
So proudly with the splendour of 
Love's praise, 

The pain, the calm, and the astonishment, 

Desire illimitable, and still content. 

And all dear names men use, to cheat de- 
spair. 

For the perplexed and viewless streams 
that bear 

Our hearts at random down the dark of 
life. 

Now, ere the unthinking silence on that 
strife 

Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death 
so far. 

My night shall be remembered for a star 

That outshone all the suns of all men's 
days. 

Shall I not crown them with immortal praise 



RECENT POETRY 

Whom I have loved, who have given me, 

dared with me 
High secrets, and in darkness kneh to see 
The inenarrable godhead of delight? 
Love is a flame; — we have beaconed the 

world's night. 
A city: — and we have built it, these and I. 
An emperor: — we have taught the world to 

die. 
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence, 
And the high cause of Love's magnificence. 
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those 

names 
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames, 
And set them as a banner, that men may 

know. 
To dare the generations, burn, and blow 
Out on the wind of Time, shining and 

streaming. . . . 
These I have loved: 

White plates and cups, clean-gleaming, 
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery 

dust; 
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the 

strong crust

Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of

Death. 
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor

Break the high bond we made, and sell 

Love's trust 
And sacramented covenant to the dust. 
— Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I 

shall wake. 
And give what's left of love again, and 

make 
New friends, now strangers. . . . 

But the best I've known. 
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old,

About the winds of the world, and fades

Of living men, and dies.

BY THE STATUE OF KING CHARLES 
AT CHARING CROSS 

OMBRE and rich, the skies; 
Great glooms, and starry plains. 
Gently the night wind sighs; 
Else a vast silence reigns. 

The splendid silence clings 
Around me: and around 
The saddest of all kings 
Crowned, and again discrowned. 

Comely and calm, he rides 
Hard by his own Whitehall: 
Only the night wind glides: 
No crowds, nor rebels, brawl. 

Gone, too, his Court; and yet, 
The stars his courtiers are: 
Stars in their stations set; 
And every wandering star. 

-C42> 



RECENT POETRY 

Alone he rides, alone, 
The fair and fatal king: 
Dark night is all his own. 
That strange and solemn thing. 

Which are more full of fate: 
The stars; or those sad eyes? 
Which are more still and great: 
Those brows; or the dark skies? 

Although his whole heart yearn 
In passionate tragedy: 
Never was face so stern 
With sweet austerity. 

Vanquished in life, his death 
By beauty made amends: 
The passing of his breath 
Won his defeated ends. 

Brief life and hapless? Nay: 
Through death, life grew sublime. 
Speak after sentence? Yea: 
And to the end of time. 



RECENT POETRY 

Armoured he rides, his head 
Bare to the stars of doom: 
He triumphs now, the dead, 
Beholding London's gloom. 

Our wearier spirit faints. 
Vexed in the world's employ: 
His soul was of the saints; 
And art to him was joy. 

King, tried in fires of woe! 
Men hunger for thy grace: 
And through the night I go, 
Loving thy mournful face. 

Yet when the city sleeps; 
When all the cries are still: 
The stars and heavenly deeps 
Work out a perfect will.

CHECK 

'HE night was creeping on the ground; 
She crept and did not make a sound 
Until she reached the tree, and then 

She covered it, and stole again 

Along the grass beside the wall. 

I heard the rustle of her shawl 
As she threw blackness everywhere 
Upon the sky and ground and air. 
And in the room where I was hid: 
But no matter what she did 
To everything that was without, 
She could not put my candle out. 

So I stared at the night, and she 
Stared back solemnly at me.

WHEN THE LEAVES FALL 

?HEN the leaves fall off the trees 
Everybody walks on them: 
Once they had a time of ease 
High above, and every breeze 
Used to stay and talk to them. 

Then they were so debonair 

As they fluttered up and down; 
Dancing in the sunny air, 
Dancing without knowing there 
Was a gutter in the town. 

Now they have no place at all! 

All the home that they can find 
Is a gutter by a wall, 
And the wind that waits their fall 

Is an apache of a wind.

Can only see the sock she knits; 
Her dog is watching all the day 
That not a cow shall go astray. 

The leisurely contented cows 
Can only see the earth they browse; 
Their piebald bodies through the grass 
With busy, munching noses pass. 

Alone the sun and I behold 
Processions crowned with shining gold — 
The poplars in the fields of France, 
Like glorious ladies come to dance.

THE RAGWORT 

?HE thistles on the sandy flats 
Are courtiers with crimson hats; 
The ragworts, growing up so straight, 
Are emperors who stand in state, 
And march about, so proud and bold, 
In crowns of fairy-story gold. 

The people passing home at night 
Rejoice to see the shining sight, 
They quite forget the sands and sea 
Which are as grey as grey can be, 
Nor ever heed the gulls who cry 
Like peevish children in the sky.

LONE DOG 

"M a lean dog, a keen dog, a wild dog, 
and lone; 
I'm a rough dog, a tough dog, hunt- 
ing on my own; 
I'm a bad dog, a mad dog, teasing silly 

sheep; 
I love to sit and bay the moon, to keep fat 
souls from sleep. 

I'll never be a lap dog, licking dirty feet, 
A sleek dog, a meek dog, cringing for my 

meat, 
Not for me the fireside, the well-filled plate. 
But shut door, and sharp stone, and cuff, 

and kick, and hate. 

Not for me the other dogs, running by my 

side. 
Some have run a short while, but none of 

them would bide.

IF I HAD A BROOMSTICK 

T I had a broomstick, and knew how 
to ride it, 
I'd fly through the windows when Jane 
goes to tea. 
And over the tops of the chimneys I'd guide 

it. 
To lands where no children are cripples 

like me; 
I'd run on the rocks with the crabs and the 

sea. 
Where soft red anemones close when you 

touch ; 
If I had a broomstick, and knew how to 

ride it, 
If I had a broomstick — instead of a crutch!

ROUNDABOUTS AND SWINGS 

IT was early last September night to 
Framlin'am-on-Sea, 

An' 'twas Fair-day come to-morrow, 
an' the time was after tea. 
An' I met a painted caravan adown a dusty 

lane, 
A Pharaoh with his waggons comin' jolt an' 

creak an' strain; 
A cheery cove an' sunburnt, bold o' eye 

and wrinkled up, 
An' beside him on the splashboard sat a 

brindled tarrier pup, 
An' a lurcher wise as Solomon an' lean as 

fiddle-strings 
Was joggin' in the dust along 'is round- 
abouts and swings. 

"Goo'-day," said 'e; "Goo'-day," said I; 

"an' 'ow d'you find things go. 
An' what's the chance o' millions when you 

runs a travellin' show?" 



RECENT POETRY 

"I find," said 'e, "things very much as 'ow 

I've always found. 
For mostly they goes up and down or else 

goes round and round." 
Said 'e, "The job's the very spit o' what it 

always were, 
It's bread and bacon mostly when the dog 

don't catch a 'are; 
But lookin' at it broad, an' while it ain't 

no merchant king's. 
What's lost upon the roundabouts we pulls 

up on the swings! 

"Goo' luck," said 'e; "Goo' luck," said I; 
"you've put it past a doubt; 

An' keep that lurcher on the road, the game- 
keepers is out"; 

'E thumped upon the footboard an' 'e lum- 
bered on again 

To meet a gold-dust sunset down the owl- 
light in the lane; 

An' the moon she climbed the 'azels, while 
a nightjar seemed to spin 

That Pharaoh's wisdom o'er again, 'is sooth 
of lose-and-win;

For "up an' down an' round," said 'e, "goes 

all appointed things, 
An' losses on the roundabouts means profits 

on the swings!"

A TOWN WINDOW 

lEYOND my window in the night 
Is but a drab inglorious street, 
Yet there the frost and clean star- 
light 
As over Warwick woods are sweet. 

Under the grey drift of the town 
The crocus works among the mould 
As eagerly as those that crown 
The Warwick spring in flame and gold. 

And when the tramway down the hill 
Across the cobbles moans and rings, 
There is about my window-sill 
The tumult of a thousand wings.

BRUMANA 

H shall I never never be home again? 
^Ml Meadows of England shining in the 
rain 

Spread wide your daisied lawns: your ram- 
parts green 
With briar fortify, with blossom screen 
Till my far morning — and streams that 

slow 
And pure and deep through plains and play- 
lands go, 
For me your love and all your kingcups 

store, 
And — dark militia of the southern shore. 
Old fragrant friends — preserve me the last 

lines 
Of that long saga which you sung me, pines, 
When, lonely boy, beneath the chosen tree 
I listened, with my eyes upon the sea.

Singing in the silence of the

Day of my dreams, day! 

I saw them march from Dover, long ago. 
With a silver cross before them, singing 
low. 
Monks of Rome from their home where the 
blue seas break in foam, 
Augustine with his feet of snow. 

Noon strikes on England, noon on Oxford

NOVEMBER EVES 

OVEMBER Evenings! Damp and 

still 
They used to cloak Leckliampton 

hiU, 
And lie do'svn close on the grey plain, 
And dim the dripping window-pane. 
And send queer winds like Harlequins 
That seized our elms for violins 
And stiiick a note so sharp and low 
Even a child could feel the woe. 

Now fire chased shadow round the room; 
Tables and chairs grew vast in gloom: 
\^ e crept about like mice, while Nurse 
Sat mending, solemn as a hearse. 
And even our unlearned eyes 
Half closed ^vidi choking memories. 

Is it the mist or the dead leaves. 

Or the dead men — November eves?

STAR-TALK 

RE you awake, Gemelli, 
This frosty night?" 
"We'll be awake till reveille, 
Which is Sunrise," say the Gemelli, 
"It's no good trying to go to sleep: 
If there's wine to be got we'll drink it deep. 
But rest is hopeless to-night, 
But rest is hopeless to-night." 

"Are you cold too, poor Pleiads, 

This frosty night?" 
"Yes, and so are the Hyads: 
See us cuddle and hug," says the Pleiads, 
"All six in a ring: it keeps us warm: 
We huddle together like birds in a storm: 
It's bitter weather to-night. 
It's bitter weather to-night." 

"What do you hunt, Orion, 

This starry night?" 
"The Ram, the Bull and the Lion, 
And the Great Bear," says Orion,

"Yes, he's talking of stripping me bare. 
Of my own big fur," says the She-bear.

The thought of it chills my bones to the 
marrow,

And the pump has frozen to-night, 
And the pump has frozen to-night."

THE KINGFISHER 

'T was the Rainbow gave thee birth, 
And left thee all her lovely hues; 
And, as her mother's name was Tears, 
So runs it in thy blood to choose 
For haunts the lonely pools, and keep 
In company with trees that weep. 

Go you and, with such glorious hues, 

Live with proud Peacocks in green parks; 

On lawns as smooth as shining glass, 
Let every feather show its mark; 

Get thee on boughs and clap thy wings 

Before the windows of proud kings. 

Nay, lovely Bird, thou art not vain; 

Thou hast no proud ambitious mind; 
I also love a quiet place 

That's green, away from all mankind; 
A lonely pool, and let a tree 
Sigh with her bosom over me.

SHEEP 

HEN I was once in Baltimore 

A man came up to me and cried, 
"Come, I have eighteen hundred 
sheep. 
And we will sail on Tuesday's tide. 

"If you will sail with me, young man, 
I'll pay you fifty shillings down; 

These eighteen hundred sheep I take 
From Baltimore to Glasgow town." 

He paid me fifty shillings down, 

I sailed with eighteen hundred sheep; 

We soon had cleared the harbour's mouth, 
We soon were in the salt sea deep. 

The first night we were out at sea 

Those sheep were quiet in their mind; 

The second night they cried with fear — 
They smelt no pastures in the wind. 

-{:64> 



RECENT POETRY 

They sniffed, poor things, for their green 
fields, 

They cried so loud I could not sleep: 
For fifty thousand shillings down 

I would not sail again with sheep.

HOME THOUGHTS IN LAVENTIE 

REEN gardens in Laventie! 
^.^^, Soldiers only know the street 
Where the mud is churned and 
splashed about 
By battle-wending-feet; 
And yet beside one stricken house there is a 
glimpse of grass, 
Look for it when you pass. 

Beyond the Church whose pitted spire 

Seems balanced on a strand 
Of swaying stone and tottering brick 
Two roofless ruins stand, 
And here behind the wreckage where the 
back-wall should have been 
We found a garden green. 

The grass was never trodden on, 

The little path of gravel 
Was overgrown with celandine. 

No other folk did travel 
-C66> 



RECENT POETRY 

Along its weedy surface, but the nimble- 
footed mouse 
Running from house to house. 

So all among the vivid blades 

Of soft and tender grass 
We lay, nor heard the limber wheels 
That pass and ever pass, 
In noisy continuity, until their stony rattle 
Seems in itself a battle. 

At length we rose up from this ease 

Of tranquil happy mind, 
And searched the garden's little length 
A fresh pleasaunce to find; 
And there, some yellow daffodils and jas- 
mine hanging high 
Did rest the tired eye. 

The fairest and most fragrant 

Of the many sweets we found, 
Was a little bush of Daphne flower 
Upon a grassy mound. 
And so thick were the blossoms set, and so 
divine the scent. 
That we were well content. 
-C67> 



RECENT POETRY 

Hungry for Spring I bent my head, 

The perfume fanned my face, 
And all my soul was dancing 
In that lovely little place, 
Dancing with a measured step from 
wrecked and shattered towns 
Away . . . upon the Downs. 

I saw green banks of daffodil. 
Slim poplars in the breeze. 
Great tan-brown hares in gusty March 
A-courting on the leas; 
And meadows with their glittering streams, 
and silver scurrying dace. 
Home — what a perfect place!

INTO BATTLE 

•>HE naked earth is warm with Spring, 
[^H And with green grass and bursting 
trees 
Leans to the sun's gaze glorying, 

And quivers in the sunny breeze; 
And Life is Colour and Warmth and Light, 

And a striving evermore for these; 
And he is dead who will not fight; 
And who dies fighting has increase. 

The fighting man shall from the sun 

Take warmth, and life from the glowing 
earth; 

Speed with the light-foot winds to run, 
And with the trees to newer birth; 

And find, when fighting shall be done, 
Great rest, and fullness after dearth. 

All the bright company of Heaven 
Hold him in their high comradeship, 

The Dog-Star and the Sisters Seven, 
Orion's Belt and sworded hip.

AN ANTHOLOGY OF 

The woodland trees that stand together, 
They stand to him each one a friend, 

They gently speak in the windy weather; 
They guide to valley and ridges' end. 

The kestrel hovering by day, 

And the little owls that call by night, 
Bid him be swift and keen as they. 

As keen of ear, as swift of sight. 

The blackbird sings to him, "Brother, 
brother. 

If this be the last song you shall sing 
Sing well, for you may not sing another; 

Brother, sing." 

In dreary, doubtful, waiting hours, 
Before the brazen frenzy starts. 

The horses show him nobler powers; 
patient eyes, courageous hearts! 

And when the burning moment breaks, 
And all things else are out of mind, 
And only Joy of Battle takes 

Him by the throat, and makes him 
blind— 

<70> 



RECENT POETRY 

Though joy and blindness he shall know, 
Not caring much to know, that still. 

Nor lead nor steel shall reach him, so 
That it be not the Destined Will. 

The thundering line of battle stands. 
And in the air Death moans and sings; 

But Day shall clasp him with strong hands, 
And Night shall fold him in soft wings.

OVERHEARD ON A SALTMARSH 

^YMPH, nymph, what are your beads? 
Green glass, goblin. Why do you 
stare at them? 
Give them me. 

No. 

Give them me. Give them me. 

No. 

Then I will howl all night in the reeds, 
Lie in the mud and howl for them. 

Goblin, why do you love them so? 

They are better than stars or water. 
Better than voices of winds that sing. 
Better than any man's fair daughter. 
Your green glass beads on a silver ring.

A FLOWER IS LOOKING THROUGH 
THE GROUND 

FLOWER is looking through the 
ground. 
Blinking at the April weather; 
Now a child has seen the flower: 
Now they go and play together.

And will call the child its brother — 
But, oh strange forgetfulness! — 
They don't recognize each other.

MAN CARRYING BALE 

'HE tough hand closes partly on the 
load; 

Out of the mind, a voice 
Calls, "Lift!" and the arms, remembering 
well their work. 
Lengthen and pause for help. 
Then a slow ripple flows from head to foot 
While all the muscles call to one another: 
"Lift!" and the bulging bale 
Floats like a butterfly in June. 

So moved the earliest carrier of bales, 

And the same watchful sun 
Glowed through his body feeding it with 
light. 

So will the last one move. 
And halt, and dip his head, and lay his load 
Down, and the muscles will relax and trem- 
ble. 

Earth, you designed your man 

Beautiful both in labour and repose. 

HAROLD MONRO 




THE CHERRY TREES 

HE cherry trees bend over and are 
ij^gn shedding 

On the old road where all that passed

Their petals, strewing the grass as for a 

wedding 
This early May mom when there is none 
to wed.

THE BELLS OF HEAVEN 

^WOULD ring the bells of Heaven 
The wildest peal for years, 
If Parson lost his senses 
And people came to theirs,

For tamed and shabby tigers 
And dancing dogs and bears. 
And wretched, blind pit ponies, 
And little hunted hares.

THE SONG OF HONOUR 

CLIMBED a hill as light fell short, 
And rooks came home in scramble 
sort. 
And filled the trees and flapped and fought 

And sang themselves to sleep; 
An owl from nowhere with no sound 
Swung by and soon was nowhere found, 
I heard him calling half-way round, 

Holloing loud and deep; 
A pair of stars, faint pins of light. 
Then many a star, sailed into sight, 
And all the stars, the flower of night, 

Were round me at a leap; 
To tell how still the valleys lay 
I heard a watch-dog miles away, 

And bells of distant sheep. 

I heard no more of bird or bell. 
The mastiff" in a slumber fell, 

I stared into the sky, 
As wondering men have always done 
-C78> 



RECENT POETRY 

Since beauty and the stars were one, 

Though none so hard as I. 
It seemed, so still the valleys were. 
As if the whole world knelt at prayer. 

Save me and me alone; 
So pure and wide that silence was 
I feared to bend a blade of grass. 

And there I stood like stone.

TO THE COMING SPRING 

PUNCTUAL Spring! 

We had forgotten in this winter 
town 
The days of Summer and the long, long 

eves. 
But now you come on airy wing. 
With busy fingers spilling baby-leaves 
On all the bushes, and a faint green down 
On ancient trees, and everywhere 
Your warm breath soft with kisses 
Stirs the wintry air, 
And waking us to unimagined blisses. 
Your lightest footprints in the grass 
Are marked by painted crocus-flowers 
And heavy-headed daff"odils, 
While little trees blush faintly as you pass. 
The morning and the night 
You bathe with heavenly showers. 
And scatter scentless violets on the rounded 
hills. 



RECENT POETRY 

Drop beneath leafless woods pale primrose 

posies. 
With magic key, in the new evening light, 
You are unlocking buds that keep the roses ; 
The purple lilac soon will blow above the 

wall 
And bended boughs in orchards whitely 

bloom — 
We had forgotten in the Winter's gloom . . . 
Soon we shall hear the cuckoo call!

ALMS IN AUTUMN 

PINDLE-WOOD, spindle-wood, will 
you lend me, pray, 
A little flaming lantern to guide me 
on my way? 
The fairies all have vanished from the 

meadow and the glen, 
And I would fain go seeking till I find them 

once again. 
Lend me now a lantern that I may bear a 

light 
To find the hidden pathway in the darkness 
of the night. 

Ash-tree, ash-tree, throw me, if you please. 

Throw me down a slender branch of russet- 
gold keys. 

I fear the gates of Fairyland may all be 
shut so fast 

That nothing but your magic keys will ever 
take me past.

A pocketful of berries to thread in golden 

strands 
(I would not go a-visiting with nothing in 

my hands). 
So fine will be the rosy chains, so gay, so 

glossy bright. 
They'll set the realms of Fairyland all

I don't like the cistern in the attic where I 

play, 
And the funny noise the bath makes when 
the water runs away. 

I don't like the feeling when my gloves are

WISHES 

WISH I liked rice pudding, 

I wish I were a twin, 
I wish some day a real live fairy 
Would just come walking in. 

I wish when I'm at table 

My feet would touch the floor, 

I wish our pipes would burst next winter, 
Just like they did next door. 

I wish that I could whistle 

Real proper grown-up tunes, 
I wish they'd let me sweep the chimneys 

On rainy afternoons. 

I've got such heaps of wishes, 

I've only said a few; 
I wish that I could wake some morning 

And find they'd all come true !

VERY NEARLY! 

NEVER quite saw fairy-folk 

A-dancing in the glade. 
Where, just beyond the hollow oak, 
Their broad green rings are laid: 
But, while behind that oak I hid, 
One day I very nearly did! 

I never quite saw mermaids rise 

Above the twilight sea. 
When sands, left wet, 'neath sunset skies, 

Are blushing rosily: 
But — all alone, those rocks amid — 
One night I very nearly did! 

I never quite saw Goblin Grim 
Who haunts our lumber room 

And pops his head above the rim 
Of that oak chest's deep gloom: 

But once — when Mother raised the lid — 

/ very, very nearly did!

His call is clear as a call can be — 
And "Come and see!" he says: 
"Come and see!" 

^'Come and see! Come and see!" 
His house is there in the hawthorn-tree: 
The neatest house that ever you saw, 
Built all of mosses and twigs and straw: 
The folk who built were his wife and he — 
And "Come and see!" he says: 
"Come and see!" 

"Come and see! Come and see!" 
Within this house there are treasures three: 
So warm and snug in its curve they lie —

No thrush was ever so proud as he! 
His bright-eyed lady has left those eggs 
For just five minutes to stretch her legs. 
He's keeping guard in the hawthorn-tree, 
And "Come and see!" he says: 
"Come and see!" 

"Come and see! Come and see!** 

He has no fear of the boys and me.

In hungry times of the frost and snow.

Where "Come and see!" he says:

THE SUNSET GARDEN

And the garden goes up to the top of

And the sun comes each day. 
And slips down away 
At the end of the garden an' sleeps there 

. . . until 
The daylight comes climbing up over the 
hill. 

I do wish I lived in the little brown house, 
Then at night I'd go out to the garden, an' 
creep 

Up . . . up . . . then I'd stop, 
An' lean over the top.

And see what the sun looks like when it's

Why honey is the food of bees,

ALL IS SPIRIT AND PART OF ME 

GREATER lover none can be, 
And all is spirit and part of me. 
I am sway of the rolling hills, 

And breath from the great wide plains; 

I am bom of a thousand storms. 

And grey with the rushing rains; 

I have stood with the age-long rocks. 

And flowered with the meadow sweet; 

I have fought with the wind-worn firs, 

And bent with the ripening wheat; 

I have watched with the solemn clouds, 

And dreamt with the moorland pools; 

I have raced with the water's whirl, 

And lain where their anger cools; 

I have hovered as strong-winged bird, 

And swooped as I saw my prey; 

I have risen with cold grey dawn, 

And flamed in the dying day; 

For all is spirit and part of me, 

And greater lover none can be.

SEVILLE 

KNOW not Seville, 
Yet in dreams I see 
The April roses 
Climb from tree to tree, 
And foam the houses 
Till they seem to me 
Great waves of blossom 
From a crimson sea. 

I know not Seville, 
Yet in dreams I see 
The drooping petals 
Falling languidly. 
And find the shadow 
Where the grass is red 
And white with roses 
On a sun- warmed bed! 

I know not Seville, 
Yet I feel the night 
Grow heavy scented,

RECENT POETRY 

Starred with roses white, 
And low-toned singers, 
Up and down the street. 
Breathe only roses, 
Fallen at their feet.

STREET LANTERNS 

OUNTRY roads are yellow and 
brown. 
We mend the roads in London town. 



Never a hansom dare come nigh, 
Never a cart goes rolling by. 

An unwonted silence steals 
In between the turning wheels. 

Quickly ends the autumn day, 
And the workman goes his way. 

Leaving, midst the traffic rude. 
One small isle of solitude, 

Lit, throughout the lengthy night. 
By the little lantern's light. 

Jewels of the dark have we. 
Brighter than the rustic's be.

Over the dull earth are thrown 
Topaz, and the ruby stone.

TO BETSEY- JANE, ON HER DESIRING 
TO GO INCONTINENTLY TO HEAVEN 

Y Betsey-Jane, it would not do. 
For what would Heaven make of 
you, 
A little, honey-loving bear. 
Among the Blessed Babies there? 

Nor do you dwell with us in vain 
Who tumble and get up again 
And try, with bruised knees, to smile — 
Sweet, you are blessed all the while 

And we in you: so wait, they'll come 
To take your hand and fetch you home, 
In Heavenly leaves to play at tents 
With all the Holy Innocents.

THE BRIDGE 

;ERE, with one leap, 
The bridge that spans the cutting; 
on its back 
The load 

Of the main-road, 
And under it the railway-track. 

Into the plains they sweep. 

Into the solitary plains asleep. 

The flowing lines, the parallel lines of 

steel — 
Fringed with their narrow grass, 
Into the plains they pass, 
The flowing lines, like arms of mute appeal. 

A cry 

Prolonged across the earth — a call 
To the remote horizons and the sky; 
The whole east rushes down them with its 
light,

AN ANTHOLOGY OF 

And the whole west receives them, with its 

pall 
Of stars and night — 
The flowing lines, the parallel lines of steel. 

And with the fall 

Of darkness, see! the red, 

Bright anger of the signal, where it flares 

Like a huge eye that stares 

On some hid danger in the dark ahead. 

A twang of wire — unseen 

The signal drops; and now, instead 

Of a red eye, a green. 

Out of the silence grows 

An iron thunder — grows, and roars, and 

sweeps, 
Menacing! The plain 
Suddenly leaps. 
Startled, from its repose — 
Alert and listening. Now, from the gloom 
Of the soft distance, loom 
Three lights and, over them, a brush 
Of tawny flame and flying spark — 
Three pointed lights that rush. 
Monstrous, upon the cringing dark.

RECENT POETRY 

And nearer, nearer rolls the sound, 
Louder the throb and roar of wheels, 
The shout of speed, the shriek of steam; 
The sloping bank, 
Cut into flashing squares, gives back the 

clank 
And grind of metal, while the ground 
Shudders and the bridge reels — 
As, with a scream. 
The train, 

A rage of smoke, a laugh of fire, 
A lighted anguish of desire, 
A dream 

Of gold and iron, of sound and flight, 
Tumultuous roars across the night. 

The train roars past — and, with a cry, 
Drowned in a flying howl of wind, 
Half-stifled in the smoke and blind, 
The plain, 

Shaken, exultant, unconfined. 
Rises, flows on, and follows, and sweeps by, 
Shrieking, to lose itself in distance and the 
sky.

ALLOTMENTS 

ONOTONOUS and regular 
And mournful the allotments lie, 
And night, 
As if to hide their misery from sight, 
Falls, fold on fold, from the cold winter 
sky. 

A stretch of wretched garden-land 
Backed by a row of tenements that cringe 
— Monotonous and regular — 
Upon the city's outer fringe. 

Between it and the pavement-edge 

Straggles a torn and ragged hedge; 

And, here and there about it, stand 

Rude sheds of planking smeared with tar; 

While, in a corner, a rough mast and spar 

Futters for flag 

A tattered filthiness of rag. 

There in this world of fog and smoke, 
— Monotonous and regular —

RECENT POETRY 

Bent figures move about; 

They are the pitiable folk 

From their long day of toil let out — 

From their day-labour in the factory 

That looms, a square-cut menace on the 

sky, 
Near-by. 

Here, one will plant potatoes, row on row, 

— Monotonous and regular — 

Another, here, will grow 

Carrots and turnips, beans and peas, 

Or green and purple cabbages; 

While each will sow 

Nasturtium or sweet-pea — some flower to 

bring 
Him light and gladness in the spring. 

Though scarce shall tlie bud break, till 
from the air 

Damp soot shall fall to shroud it in de- 
spair 

Though every leaf 

Shall hide its hope in hoods of grief — 

Though no flower-scent shall purify

AN ANTHOLOGY OF 

This stench of oil, this reek of smoke, 
Where a poor starved humanity, 
And its poor produce, starved and stultified, 
Grow side by side. 

So far from nature's first intent, 

So far from what the brown earth meant, 

So far from what the wind and wet. 

The seasons and the sun. 

In many an unlaborious field have done! 

And yet. 

When one of these poor folk 

Shall stand and gaze in summer's easier 

hours 
Upon the humbled beauty of his flowers, 

Not Adam in his Paradise, 

Beheld with more of worship in his eyes 

The first 

Rare rose that burst 

In lovely wonder to the skies. 

Monotonous and regular 

And mournful the allotments lie — 

While night,

FEBRUARY 

^HE robin on my lawn 
He was the first to tell 
How, in the frozen dawn, 
This miracle befell. 
Waking the meadows white 
With hoar, the iron road 
Agleam with splintered light, 
And ice where water flowed: 
Till, when the low sun drank 
Those milky mists that cloak 
Hanger and hollied bank. 
The winter world awoke 
To hear the feeble bleat 
Of lambs on downland farms: 
A blackbird whistled sweet ; 
Old beeches moved their arms 
Into a mellow haze 
Aerial, newly-born: 
And I, alone, agaze. 
Stood waiting for the thorn 
To break in blossom white, 
-C106> 



RECENT POETRY 

Or burst in a green flame. . . . 
So, in a single night, 
Fair February came. 
Bidding my lips to sing 
Or whisper their surprise. 
With all the joy of spring 
And morning in her eyes.

SEA-FOAM 

FLECK of foam on the shining sand, 

Left by the ebbing sea, 
But richer than man may understand 
In magic and mystery — 
Transient bubbles rainbow-bright, 

Myriad-hued and strange, 
Tremble and throb in the noonday light. 
Flower and flush and change. 

A million tides have come and gone, 

Great gales of autumn and spring, 
A million summoning moons have shone 

To bring to birth this thing — 
A foam-fleck left on the ribbed wet sand 

By the wave of an outgoing sea. 
With all the colour of Faeryland, 

Wonder and mystery.

A PETITION 

'LL that a man might ask, thou hast 
given me, England, 
Birth-right and happy childhood's 
long heart's-ease, 
And love whose range is deep beyond all 
sounding 
And wider than all seas. 

A heart to front the world and find God 
in it, 
Eyes blind enow, but not too blind to 
see 
The lovely things behind the dross and 
darkness. 
And lovelier things to be. 

And friends whose loyalty time nor death 
shall weaken. 
And quenchless hope and laughter's 
golden store; 

-C109> 



RECENT POETRY 

All that a man might ask thou hast given 
me, England, 
Yet grant thou one thing more: 

That now when envious foes would spoil 
thy splendour. 
Unversed in arms, a dreamer such as I 
May in thy ranks be deemed not all un- 
worthy, 
England, for thee to die.

BLACK AND WHITE 

MET a man along the road 
To Withernsea; 
Was ever anything so dark, so pale 
As he? 
His hat, his clothes, his tie, his boots 
Were black as black 
Could be, 
And midst of all was a cold white face. 
And eyes that looked wearily. 

The road was bleak and straight and flat 

To Withernsea, 
Gaunt poles with shrilling wires their weird 

Did dree; 
On the sky stood out, on the swollen sky 
The black blood veins 

Of tree 
After tree, as they beat from the face 
Of the wind which they could not flee.

RECENT POETRY 

And in the fields along the road 

To Withemsea, 
Swart crows sat huddled on the ground 

Disconsolately, 
While overhead the seamews wheeled, and 
skirled 

In glee; 
But the black crows stood, and cropped 
where they stood, 

And nevei heeded thee, 
dark pale man, with the weary eyes, 

On the road to Withernsea.

THE OXEN 

;HRISTMAS eve, and twelve of the 
clock. 
"Now they are all on their knees," 
An elder said as we sat in a flock 
By the embers in hearthside ease. 

We pictured the meek mild creatures where 
They dwelt in their strawy pen. 

Nor did it occur to one of us there 
To doubt they were kneeling then. 

So fair a fancy few believe 

In these years! Yet, I feel. 
If someone said on Christmas Eve 

"Come; see the oxen kneel 

In the lonely barton by yonder coomb 
Our childhood used to know," 

I should go with him in the gloom, 
Hoping it might be so.
