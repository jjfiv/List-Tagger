CALIFOENIA 

BAYAED TAYLOR 

fair young land, the youngest, fairest far 

Of which our world can boast— 
Whose guardian planet, evening's silver star, 

Illumes thy golden coast, — 

How art thou conquered, tamed in all the pride 

Of savage beauty still ! 
How brought, panther of the splendid hide, 

To know thy master's will ! 

No more thou sittest on thy tawny hills 

In indolent repose ; 
Or pourest the crystal of a thousand rills 

Down from thy house of snows. 

But where the wild oats wrapped thy knees 
in gold, 
The plowman drives his share, 
And where, through canons deep, thy streams 
are rolled, 
The miner's arm is bare. 

Yet in thy lap, thus rudely rent and torn, 

A. nobler seed shall be ; 
Mother of mighty men, thou shalt not mourn 

Thy lost virginity ! 

Thy human children shall restore the grace 

Gone with thy fallen pines ; 
The wild, barbaric beauty of thy face 

Shall round to classic lines.

And order, justice, social law shall curb 

Thy untamed energies ; 
And art and science, with their dreams superb, 

Replace thine ancient ease. 

The marble, sleeping in thy mountains now, 

Shall live in sculptures rare ; 
Thy native oak shall crown the sage's brow — 

Thy bay, the poet's hair. 

Thy tawny hills shall bleed their purple wine, 

Thy valleys yield their oil ; 
And music, with her eloquence divine, 

Persuade thy sons to toil. 

Till Hesper, as he trims his silver beam, 

No happier land shall see, 
And earth shall find her old Arcadian dream 

Restored again in thee !

THE GOLDEN GATE 

"Caxton" — (w. h. rhodes) 

Old Thebes could boast of her gates of brass, 

As they grated on hinges hoary, 
And loosened their bolts for a monarch to pass, 

On his errands of guilt and glory. 

But their portals were closed on a nation of slaves, 
Kneeling low at the foot of a Pharaoh, 

And the Nile now waters an Egypt of graves, 
From sepulchral Phils, to Cairo. 

Eemorseless Time, in his journeyings on, 

Like Samson, at Gaza, of old, 
On his shoulders her hundred gates have bore, 

And covered their sheen with mold. 

But further than Ind, in the western world, 

Unknown to the sages olden, 
Young Freedom, at length, has her banner 
unfurled, 

In a city whose Gate is Golden. 

Its glittering bars are the breakers high, 

Its hinges are hills of granite, 
Its bolts are the winds, its arch is the sky, 

Its corner-stone a planet ! 

Inside of its portals no slave bows his head, 

To priestess of On or of Isis, 
Or covers the ground a monarch may tread, 

With the slime of a minion's kisses. 

But proud of his home in a city so fair, 

Enthroned on her hillocks seven, 
He stands like a Roman, and breathes the free air, 

And kneels to no God, but in heaven. 

No giant can tear from their pillars away, 

The Golden Gate of his glory, 
For as long as the winds and the waters play, 

It shall swing on its hinges hoary*

THE SONG OP THE FLUME 

ANNA M. FITCH 

Awake, awake ! for my track is red, 

With the glow of the coming day ; 
And with tinkling tread, from my dusty bed, 

I haste o 'er the hills away, 
Up from the valley, up from the plain, 

Up from the river's side ; 
For I come with a gush, and a torrent's rush, 

And there 's wealth in my swelling tide. 

I am fed by the melting rills that start 

Where the sparkling snow-peaks gleam, 
My voice is free, and with fiercest glee 

I leap in the sun's broad beam; 
Tho' torn from the channels deep and old, 

I have worn through the craggy hill, 
Yet I flow in pride, as my waters glide, 

And there's mirth in my music still. 

I sought the shore of the sounding sea, 

From the far Sierra's hight, 
With a starry breast, and a snow-capped crest 

I foamed in a path of light ; 
But they bore me thence in a winding way, 

The've fettered me like a slave, 
And as scarfs of old were exchanged for gold, 

So they barter my soil-stained wave. 

Thro * the deep tunnel, down the dark shaft, 

I search for the shining ore ; 
Hoist it away to the light of day, 

Which it never has seen before. 
Spade and shovel, mattock and pick, 

Ply them with eager haste ; 
For my golden shower is sold by the hour. 

And the drops are too dear to waste.

PIONEER PERIOD 1849 TO 1869 



Lift me aloft to the mountain's brow, 

Fathom the deep "blue vein," 
And I'll sift the soil for the shining spoil, 

As I sink to the valley again. 
The swell of my swarthy breast shall bear 

Pebble and rock away, 
Though they brave my strength, they shall yield at 
length, 

But the glittering gold shall stay. 

Mine is no stern and warrior march, 

No stormy trump and drum ; 
No banners gleam in my darkened stream, 

As with conquering step I come ; 
But I touch the tributary earth 

Till it owns a monarch's sway, 
And with eager hand, from a conquered land, 

I bear its wealth away. 

Awake, awake ! there are living hearts 

In tBe lands you've left afar; 
There are tearful eyes in the homes you prize 

As they gaze on the western star ; 
Then up from the valley, up from the hill, 

Up from the river's side ; 
For I come with a gush, and a torrent's rush, 

And there's wrath in my swelling tide.

THE SABBATH BELLS 

JOHN K. RIDGE 

The Sabbath bells are ringing 
With clear and cheerful notes, 

And from the steeple springing, 
Far off the music floats. 

To yonder mountain reaches, 

The ever rising strain, 
And Echo's dying speeches 

Repeat it o'er again. 

The summer woodlands filling, 
The solemn cadence rolls, 

And through the leaves is thrilling 
Like soft, pulsating souls. 

The air with rippling motion, 

Aeolian answer gives, 
And like a trembling ocean, 

Its outspread bosom heaves. 

The far horizon sweeping, 
Each tone majestic swells, 

And all the world is leaping 
Beneath the sounding bells. 

'Tis solemn, yet 'tis cheerful, 
A clear and pleasant voice, 
' That bids the sad and tearful 
Be hopeful and rejoice. 

Let Sabbath morns unclouded 
Still hear these tones of peace, 

For earth with woe is shrouded 
When Sabbath bells shall cease.

AN EVENING SONG AT SEA 

C. E. HAVENS 

Sweet night, whence sweeter calm doth flow, 

Sweet solitude of sea and sky : 

Made sweeter far, because I know 

That thou with all sweet things must die ; — 

For beauty fades from .out the eye, 

And love itself will cease to be ; 

As summer winds from tropic shores, 

Die on the smooth unruffled sea. 

Now, Hesperus, evening star of love 
Flings o'er the waves a lane of light; 
And constellations from above 
Gleam out like di 'mond on the sight : 
And phosphor, glinting silver-white 
From out the deep and dimpled sea, 
Looks like another realm of stars 
In Heaven's inverted canopy. 

Sweet double star of love and rest, 
That usherest in the hour of sleep ; 
I watch in grief thy waning crest 
Go glimmering down the dusky deep. 
"While other stars their vespers keep, 
My longing thoughts revert to thee, 
And follow up, thy trail of light 
To other heavens beyond the sea.

TO THE SIERRAS 

J. J. OWEN 

Ye snow-capped mountains, basking in the sun, 
Like fleecy clouds that deck the summer skies, 

On you I gaze, when day's dull task is done, 
Till night shuts out your glories from my eyes. 

For stormy turmoil, and ambition's strife, 
I find in you a solace and a balm, — 

Derive a higher purpose, truer life, 
From your pale splendor, passionless and calm. 

Mellowed by distance, all your rugged cliffs, 
And deep ravines, in graceful outlines lie ; 

Each giant form in silent grandeur lifts 
Its hoary summit to the evening sky. 

I reck not of the wealth untold, concealed 
Beneath your glorious coronal of snows, 

"Whose budding treasure yet but scarce revealed, 
Should blossom into trade — a golden rose. 

A mighty realm is waking at your feet 
To life and beauty, from the lap of Time, 

With cities vast, where millions yet shall meet, 
And Peace shall reign in majesty sublime. 

Rock-ribbed Sierras, with your crests of snow, 
A type of manhood, ever strong and true, 

Whose heart with golden wealth should ever glow, 
Whose thoughts in purity should symbol you.

TO MY MOTHER 

STEPHEN O. MASSETT 

My Mother ! canst thou see me now 

From the far-off fields of light — 
Canst thou in spirit come again, 

And bless me with thy sight ? 
Oh ! I can see thee, when these eyes 

Are closed in balmy sleep ; 
And reveling in happy dreams 

We sweet communion keep ! 

Years, years have passed, and life to me 

Has been but as a dream, 
Yet often have I yearned for thee, 

As sailing down its stream, 
Pond memory brings thee back again, 

As thou wert once to me : 
"When nestled in thy arms I lay, 

Or crept upon thy knee ! 

And when I saw thee in that sleep 

From which there is no waking, 
And felt as I then gazed on thee 

My very heart was breaking ; 
Oh ! can it be, that in that land, 

Where there is no more pain, 
We may once more united be, 

Never to part again 1 

And shall we meet as we have met, 

And be as we have been — 
And shall I see thee on me smile, 

As I have sometimes seen ? 
Oh God ! if this it is to meet 

In Heaven's own land of light, 
Illume my path — direct my feet, 

And guide my steps aright !

THE LONE PINE 

B. P. AVERY 

Sway thy top, thou ancient pine — 

Warrior of the storm commanding ! 
Lone upon the mountain standing, 
Whom no ivy's arms entwine. 
Melancholy souls like mine, 

'Neath thy shadow passing slow, 
Love to hear thy plaintive moan ; 

'Tis an echo of the woe 
Found in human breasts alone. 

Mournfully amid the ruins 

Of thy fellows standest thou, 
Like a column of some temple 
Living but in story now ; 
All around it, wildly scattered, 
Fallen walls and pillars shattered. 
Softly sighing through thy branches 

Sounds the wind, with fall and swell ; 
Now retreats, and now advances, 

Rousing fancy with its spell, 
Like the melody that chances 

On the ear from distant bell, 
Or the murmur that entrances 

Of the tinted sea-side shell. 
Lo ! musing on thy loneliness, 

Thy brethren seem again to rise ; 
On every hand a wilderness 

Shuts out the prospect of the skies. 

'Tis verdure all, and deepest shade, no sound 

Disturbs the thoughtful silence, save 

A murmur such as rolls through Ocean cave, 

And rustling of dry leaves upon the ground. 

But while I listen with an awe profound, 

A glance dispels the visionary wood — 

A single tree remains where late ten thousand stood.

NO BABY IN THE HOUSE 

CLARA DOLLIVER 

No baby in the house I know — 

'Tis far too nice and clean ; 
No toys by careless fingers strewn 

Upon the floors are seen. 
*so finger-marks are on the panes, 

No scratches on the chairs, 
No wooden men set up in rows, 

Or marshaled off in pairs ; 
No little stockings to be darned, 

All ragged at the toes, 
No pile of mending to be done, 

Made up of baby-clothes ; 
No little troubles to be soothed, 

No little hands to fold ; 
No grimy fingers to be washed, 

No stories to be told ; 
No tender kisses to be given, 

No nick-names — ' ' Clove ' ' and ' ' Mouse ; ' 
No merry frolics after tea — 

No baby in the house. 



THE PARTING HOUR 

EDWARD POLLOCK 

There 's something in the ' ' parting hour, 

Will chill the warmest heart, 
Yet kindred, comrades, lovers, friends, 

Are fated all to part ; 
But this I 've seen — and many a pang 

Has pressed it on my mind — 
The one that goes is happier 

Than those he leaves behind.

G. 

Truth, like the diamond, is a fount of light, 
Beaming effulgent in the darkest night ; 
Error its ebon form may intervene, 
But still it beams as brightly, though unseen ; 
And though thus hid till centuries have past, 
The steady fire shall slay the foe at last. 
Dark clouds may sometimes veil its radiant form, 
And lightning rend it ; — but, amid the storm, 
The gem is undefiled, and its pure ray 
Brighter shall shine; like sunbeams on the day 
When storm, and cloud, and lightning pass 
away.

When Jones was sixteen, he was bent 
On one day being President. 

At twenty-five, Jones thought that he 
Content as District Judge would be. 

At thirty, he was much elated 

When Mayor of Progtown nominated. 

But bootless all the nomination — 

His rival Tompkins graced the station. 

At forty-five, his dreams had fled ; 
Hope and Ambition, both were dead. 

When from his toils he found release, 
He died — a Justice of the Peace.

Thus is thy brief, sad story told !

TO MY FIRST LOVE 

OHOWQTJILL 

This heart has beat to many a one, 

To many, passing fair ; 
But oh ! the Love which first it knew, 

Still lingers fondly there ; — 
Though brighter eyes have beamed on me,- 

And rosier lips I've prest, 
The Love which first I felt for thee — 

Yet dwells within my breast. 

Tho' softer skies are o'er me now, 

And stars shine brighter here ; 
Tho' Nature wears a sunny smile 

And birds sing all the year, 
Yet I would fain them all resign, 

To dwell once more with thee, 
For one sweet smile from lips like thine, 

Were dearer far to me. 

As memory clings around the spot, 

"Where first the breath we drew, 
And all our kindlier thoughts are placed 

On scenes that first we knew — 
So earliest Love still twines around 

The heart which beats to ours, 
As Summer's sweetest dew is found 

Upon the earliest flowers.

SONG OP LABOR; THE MINER 

JOHN SWETT 

The eastern sky is blushing red, 

The distant hill-top glowing ; 
The brook is murmuring in its bed, 

In idle frolics flowing ; 
'Tis time the pickaxe and the spade, 

And iron "torn" were ringing, 
And with ourselves, the mountain stream, 

A song of labor singing. 

The mountain air is cool and fresh, 

Unclouded skies bend o'er us, 
Broad placers, rich in hidden gold, 

Lie temptingly before us ; 
We ask no magic Midas ' wand, 

Nor wizard rod divining, 
The pickaxe, spade and brawny hand 

Are sorcerers in mining. 

When labor ceases with the day, 

To simple fare returning, 
We gather in a merry group 

Around the camp-fires burning ; 
The mountain sod our Goueh at night, 

The stars shine bright above us, 
We think of home and fall asleep, 

To dream of those who love us.

I love the music of the wave, 

I love the night wind's song ; 
I love to hear the storm king cheer 

His frenzied host along ; 
I love all nature 's thrilling tones, 

I love the notes of art — 
But better far, than all, I love 

The music of the heart. 

I love the tints of beauty laid 

Softly on leaf and flower ; 
The trembling light that gilds the night, 

And wraps the midnight hour ; 
I love the sunny warmth and light 

From the glad sunbeams stole — 
But better far, than all, I love 

The beauty of the soul. 

I prize all heaven's precious gifts, 

Laid on the earth or sea ; 
The lowliest flower that decks life's bower 

Is beautiful to me : 
I value every ray of light 

That gleams below — above ; 
But, oh ! I value more than these 

The smiles of those I love.

HURRAH FOR THE NEXT THAT DIES! 

BARTHOLOMEW DOWLING 

[This remarkable poem relates to revelry in India at a 
time when the English officers serving in that country -were 
being struck down by pestilence. It has been correctly styled 
"the very poetry of military despair."] 

We meet 'neath the sounding rafter, 

And the walls around are bare : 
As they shout back our peals of laughter, 

It seems as the dead were there. 
Then stand to your glasses ! — steady ! 

We drink 'fore our comrades' eyes; 
One cup to the dead already : 

Hurrah for the next that dies ! 

Not here are the goblets glowing, 

Not here is the vintage sweet ; 
'Tis cold as our hearts are growing, 

And dark as the doom we meet. 
But stand to your glasses ! — steady ! 

And soon shall our pulses rise. 
One cup to the dead already : 

Hurrah for the next that dies ! 

There's many a hand that's shaking, 

And many a cheek that's sunk; 
But soon, though our hearts are breaking, 

They'll burn with the wine we've drunk. 
Then stand to your glasses ! — steady ! 

'Tis here the revival lies ; 
Quaff a cup to the dead already : 

Hurrah for the next that dies ! 

Time was when we laughed at others ; 

We thought we were wiser then. 
Ha ! ha! let them think of their mothers, 

Who hope to see them again.

My country ! My country ! I'll love thee forever ! 
Fair land of my birth ; I forget thee will never : 
Though severed from thee by the deep-heaving main, 
Hope's whispers still tell me I'll see thee again — 
Truth reigning triumphant, by shores uninvaded, 
Thy beauty unshorn, and thy Thistle unf aded. 

When Summer makes Nature her glories disclose, 
When Winter is robed in her mantle of snows, 
And withers the flowerets that deck the gay scene, 
Thy Thistle stands forth in its garment of green. 
Proud emblem of freedom ! disdaining to crouch, 
The tyrant reels back at its deep-piercing touch ; 

He cannot, he dare not, its beauty deform, 
For boldly it stands 'mid the tempest and storm. 
Oh ! long may it wave on the green mountain side, 
Unfading as Truth in the strength of its pride : 
Then spare it, Time, from the wrecks of decay, 
Till Nature expires and the hills melt away.

When you lay shivering with the great excess 
Of mother-marvel at your child's first cry; 
When you looked up and saw him standing by, 

Leaning the strong unspeakable utterness 
Of all his soul upon you ; when you smiled, 

And your weak lips strove mightily to frame 

To a new song your new life's oriflamme, 
And presently the infinite words, ' ' Our child, ' ' 

Made a most musical murmur, as of breath 
Breathed by a poet's spirit— did you know 
The babe 's slight moan, that seemed so faint 
and low, 

Was God's voice speaking from dear Nazareth, 
Covering you up with that white light that lay 
On Mary and her young Christ in the hay ?

Bells of the Past, whose long-forgotten music 

Still fills the wide expanse, 
Tingeing the sober twilight of the Present 

"With color of romance : 

I hear your call, and see the sun descending 

On rock and wave and sand, 
As down the coast the Mission voices blending 

Girdle the heathen land. 

Within the circle of your incantation 

No blight nor mildew falls ; 
Nor fierce unrest, nor lust, nor low ambition 

Passes those airy walls. 

Borne on the swell of your long waves receding, 

I touch the farther Past, — 
I see the dying glow of Spanish glory, 

The sunset dream and last ! 

Before me rise the dome-shaped Mission towers, 

The white Presidio ; 
The swart commander in his leathern jerkin, 

The priest in stole of snow. 

Once more I see Portola's cross uplifting 

Above the setting sun ; 
And past the headland, northward, slowly drifting 

The freighted galleon. 

solemn bells ! whose consecrated masses 

Biecall the faith of old, — 
tinkling bells ! that lulled with twilight music 

The spiritual fold ! 

Your voices break and falter in the darkness, — 

Break, falter, and are still ; 
And veiled and mystic, like the Host descending, 

The sun sinks from the hill !

There lies a little city in the hills ; 

White are its roofs, dim is each dwelling's door,

There the pure mist, the pity of the sea, 
Comes as a white, soft hand, and reaches o 'er 
And touches its still face most tenderly. 

Unstirred and calm, amid our shifting years, 
Lo ! where it lies, far from the clash and roar, 
With quiet distance blurred, as if thro ' tears. 

O heart, that prayest so for God to send 

Some loving messenger to go before 

And lead the way to where thy longings end, 

Be sure, be very sure, that soon will come 
His kindest angel, and through that still door 
Into the Infinite love will lead thee home.

. SWEETHEARTS AND WIVES 

DANIEL O'CONNELL 

If sweethearts were sweethearts always, 

Whether as maid or wife, 
No drop would he half so pleasant 

In the mingled draught of life. 

But the sweetheart has smiles and blushes 
When the wife has frowns and sighs, 

And the wife's have a wrathful glitter 
For the glow of the sweetheart's eyes. 

If lovers were lovers always, 

The same to sweetheart and wife, 

Who would change for a future of Eden 
The joys of this checkered life ? 

But husbands grow grave and silent, 

And cares on the anxious brow 
Oft replace the sunshine that perished 

At the words of the marriage vow. 

Happy is he whose sweetheart 

Is wife and sweetheart still — 
Whose voice, as of old, can charm ; 

Whose kiss, as of old, can thrill ; 

Who has plucked the rose, to find ever 
Its beauty and fragrance increase, 

As the flush of passion is mellowed 
In love 's unmeasured peace ; 

Who sees in the step a lightness ; 

Who finds in the form a grace ; 
Who reads an unaltered brightness 

In the witchery of the face, 

Undimmed and unchanged. Ah ! happy 

Is he crowned with such a life, 
Who drinks the wife, pledging the sweetheart, 

And toasts in the sweetheart the wife.

HELEN HUNT JACKSON 

"Darling," he said, "I never meant 
To hurt you;" and his eyes grew wet. 

' ' I would not hurt you for -the world ! 
Am I to blame if I forget ? ' ' 

"Forgive my selfish tears !" she cried. 

"Forgive ! I knew that it was not 
That you would mean to hurt me, love ; 

I knew it was that you forgot ! ' ' 

But, all the same, deep in her heart 
Rankled this thought, and rankles yet : 

When love is at its best, one loves 
So much that he can not forget ! 



A BIRD SINGS IN MY HEART 

IRENE HARDY 

A bird sings in the garden of my heart, 
And all day long I hear its carol clear ; 
At night it folds its gentle wings so near, 
Its tender pulsings stir my blood and start 
The tears within my eyes to think Love's art 
Should stay her wings with me and make so dear 
The rude wild bowers of my demesne, nor fear 
But she should find her spirit's counterpart. 
All day I go resolved and thinking how 
To make more sweet for her that garden place ; 
How I will pluck away the weeds, the rose 
Of Love to plant there for her nesting-bough ; 
How I will school my heart to every grace 
That it may be her home, her one repose.

I know not how it is with you — 

I love the first and last, 
The whole field of the present view, 

The whole flow of the past. 

One tittle of the things that are, 
Nor you should change nor I — 

One pebble in our path — one star 
In all our heaven of sky. 

Our lives, and every day and hour, 

One sympathy appear : 
One road, one garden- — every flower 

And every bramble dear.

That land full surely hastens to its end 
Where public sycophants in homage bend 
The populace to natter, and repeat

They creep to eminence through paths of shame, 
Till fixed securely in the seats of pow'r,

Devoid of hope, devoid of fear, 

Half brigand, and half cavalier, —

Wears ever on his tawny face • 

A sad, defiant look of pain.

A living fragment of the past, —

Or old Diablo 's dream set land; 

By San Francisco Bay so blue, 

Or down some cypress avenue 

Near Monterey ; by lake, Sierra rimmed, 

Or yet afar in valleys vineyard trimmed ; 

On plain where Ceres waves her wand, 

Or where Pomona fond 

And all her train in foothill orchards drowse 

Under low bending boughs — 

Look up ! 

And from the turquoise cup 

Drain dreams and rest ! 

Ah, none so blest 

As one who, weary of life's endless quest 

In this fair meadow, poppy pillowed, lies, 

Day dreaming 'neath these California skies —

In this deep cleft, so set apart — 

So close to Nature's throbbing heart — 

I stand in fear, 

For God is near. 

With wondering eyes, from dizzy trails, 
I look on floods and granite vales, 

And in them see 

Divinity. 

From towering cliffs and ice-hewn crown 
The arrow-feathered pines look down 

Where God alone 

Has set His throne. 

Be stili my soul ; the Presence greet. 
Unclasp the sandals from thy feet, 

For all around — 

'Tis holy ground.

Within the ruined church at Carmel's bay, 
Beside the altar, with rank weeds o'ergrown, 
There's a grave unmarked with slab or stone, 
Where lies one who, lost sight of in our day, 

Yet bides his time ; and when have passed away 
Our would-be heroes, he will then be known, 
And glory's heritage at last will own, 

His title to which no one will gainsay. 

When life was nearing to an end, 'twas here, 
Seeking repose, the Padre Serra came ; 

Of our fair land he was the pioneer : 
And if the good alone were known to fame, 

Within our hearts his memory would be dear, 
And on our lips a household word his name.

Thou brown, bare-breasted, voiceless mystery, 

Hot sphinx of nature, cactus-erowned, what hast thou 

done? 
Unclothed and mute as when the groans of chaos 

turned 
Thy naked burning bosom to the sun. 
The mountain silences have speech, the rivers sing. 
Thou answerest never unto anything. 
Pink-throated lizards pant in thy slim shade ; 
The horned toad runs rustling in the heat ; 
The shadowy gray coyote, born afraid, 
Steals to some brackish spring and laps, and prowls 
Away, and howls and howls and howls and howls, 
Until the solitude is shaken with an added loneliness. 
Thy sharp mescal shoots up a giant stalk, 
Its century of yearning, to the sunburnt skies, 
And drips rare honey from the lips 
Of yellow waxen flowers, and dies. 
Some lengthwise sun-dried shapes with feet and 

hands 
And thirsty mouths pressed on the sweltering sands, 
Mark here and there a gruesome graveless spot 
Where some one drank thy scorching hotness, and is 

not. 
God must have made thee in his anger, and forgot.

The murmurous monotone of waving grain 
When winds are gently winging down the vale ; 
The storm-voiced billows drowning men bewail ; 
The pattering stroke of softly falling rain ; 

The sighing leaves that bend to every tale 
The breezes tell; the songster's lilting strain, 
Prom feeblest note of all the joyful train 
To rapturous burst of peerless nightingale ; — 

"What are all these, and all that human ear 
In sweetest concord from their kin can hear, 
But hints of deeper rhythms as yet unheard ; 

That in the soul ineffable of things 
An ordered Music, by the eternal word, 
Throughout the vast of space divinely sings.

Fair are the flowers and the children, but their 

subtle suggestion is fairer ; 
Rare is the roseburst of dawn, but the secret that 

clasps it is rarer ; 
Sweet the exultance of song, but the strain that 

precedes it is sweeter; 
And never was poem yet writ, but the meaning 

butmastered the meter 

Never a daisy that grows, but a mystery guideth 

the growing ; 
Never a river that flows, but a majesty scepters 

the flowing ; 
Never a Shakespeare that soared, but a stronger 

than he did enfold him, 
Nor ever a prophet foretells, but a mightier seer 

hath foretold him. ' 



Back of the canvas that throbs the painter is 

hinted and hidden ; 
Into the statue that breathes the soul of the sculptor 

is bidden ; 
Under the joy that is felt lie the infinite issues of 

feeling ; 
Crowning the glory revealed is the glory that 

crowns the revealing. 

Greajt are the symbols of being, but that which is 

symboled is greater ; 
Vast the create and beheld, but vaster the inward 

creator ; 
Back of the sound broods the silence, back of the 

gift stands the giving ; 
Back of the hand that receives thrill the sensitive 

nerves of receiving.

Twin voices and shadows swim starward, and the

Can this be Christmas — sweet as May, 
With drowsy sun, and dreamy air, 

And new grass pointing out the way 
For flowers to follow, everywhere 1 

Has time grown sleepy at his post, 
And let the exiled Summer back, 

Or is it her regretful ghost, 
Or witchcraft of the almanac ? 



Before me, on the wide, warm bay, 
A million azure ripples run ; 

Round me the sprouting palm-shoots lay 
Their shining lances to the sun. 

With glossy leaves that poise or swing, 
The callas their white cups unfold, 

And faintest chimes of odor ring 
From silver bells with tongues of gold. 

A languor of deliciousness 

Fills all the sea-enchanted clime ; 

And in the blue heavens meet, and kiss, 
The loitering clouds of summer-time.

Wot's that you're readin' ? — a novel? A novel, —

Stuff about gals and their sweethearts ! No wonder

Look at me ! — clar two hundred, — and never read 

one in my life ! 

That's my opinion o' novels. And ez to their

They belonged to the Jedge's daughter, — the Jedge 

who came up last year 
On account of his lungs and the mountains and 

the balsam o' pine and fir; 
And his daughter, — well, she read novels, and 

that's what's the matter with her. 

Yet she allers was sweet on the Jedge, and she 

stuck by him day and night, 
Alone in the cabin up yer, — till she grew like a 

ghost, all white. 
She wus only a slip of a thing, ez light and ez up 

and away 
Ez rifle-smoke blown through the woods, but she 

wasn 't my kind, — no way ! 

Speaking o' gals, d'ye mind that house ez you

A mile and a half from White's, and jist above 

Mattingly's mill?

But what was I talking of ? — Oh, the Jedge and

Novels the whole day long, and I reckon she read 

them abed, 
And sometimes she read them out loud to the Jedge 

on the porch where he sat, 
And 't was how "Lord Augustus" said this, and 

how ' ' Lady Blanche ' ' she said that. 

But the sickest of all that I heerd, was a yarn thet 

they read 'bout a chap, 
"Leather-stocking" by name, and a hunter chock 

full o' the greenest o' sap ; 
And they asked me to hear, but I says, "Miss 

Mabel, not any for me ; 
When I likes I kin sling my own lies, and thet chap 

and I shouldn't agree." 

Yet somehow or other she was always sayin' I 

brought her to mind 
Of folks about whom she had read, or suthin belike 

of thet kind, 
And thar warn't no end o' the names that she give 

me thet summer up there, 
"Robin Hood," "Leather-stocking," "Rob Roy," 

— Oh, I tell you, the critter was queer. 

And yet ef she hadn 't been spiled, she was harmless

She could jabber in French to her dad, and they

And she worked me that shot-pouch up thar, —

And slippers — you see 'em down yer — ez would

Yet along o' them novels, you see she was wastin' 

and mopin' away, 
And then she got shy with her tongue, and at last 

she had nothin' to say; 
And whenever I happened around, her face it was 

hid by a book, 
And it was n't until she left that she give me ez 

much ez a look. 

And this was the way it was. It was night when 

I kem up here 
To say to 'em all ' ' good by, ' ' for I reckoned to go

At "sun up" the day they left. So I shook 'em all 

round by the hand, 
'Cept Mabel, and she was sick, ez they give me to 

understand. 

But jist ez I passed the house next morning at 

dawn, some one, 
Like a little waver o ' mist, got up on the hill with 

the sun ; 
Miss Mabel it was, all alone, — wrapped up in a 

mantle o ' lace, — 
And she stood there straight in the road, with a 

touch o' the sun in her face. 

And she looked me right in the eye, — I 'd seen 

suthin like it before 
When I hunted a wounded doe to the edge o ' the

And I had my knee on its neck, and jist was a

When it give me a look like that, and-L-well, it got

Loosed with a jar 

From its setting 
I' the coronet moon, 
And begetting, 
As it fell with a whirl — 
Whirling far — 
A splendor that faded too soon ? 

Was it a dream 

Of some splendid star born, 
That glowed with a gleam 
And a quiver 
That startled the night? 
Like a river 
That flowed to the moon 
It did seem, 
In its luminous, lustrous light. 

Was it a gem 

Transfixed with a ray 
From the burning, bright hem 
Of the wondrous, 
Terrible sun, or the moon ? 
Over us, under us, 
Nor night, no, nor day 
Hath its equal, bright gem, 
Fair feather of light, flown too soon.

With its white adobe walls, 
The court with its wild grown flowers, 

And the stone-paved Spanish halls, 

She lives — the slim, dark woman 
"With the pale Madonna face, 

And the brown hands ever weaving, 
Fold on fold of cobweb lace. 

Prom the town of San Francisco, 
To the shores of Carmel Bay, 

She was known "Donna Maria" 
As the "Belle of Monterey." 

The man whose youth had left him, 
The boy with fresh, fair face 

And the dark browed Hidalgo 

Strove to find in her heart his place. 

But though her lovers were legion, 
There was one apart from the rest, 

And of all the gay throng 'round her, 
She loved that man the best. 

But his home was not in the West-lands 
And his heart was with his home, 

So Donna Maria in her casa 
Lives year after year alone. 

And yesterday we found her 
With her inborn Spanish grace. 

She showed us her flower garden, 
And the quaint old foreign place.

And from wrappings yellowed by time, 

There came that aroma of romance, 
Born only by Spain's sunny clime. 

The rebosas, the old mantillas, 
Fans, jewels, and rare fine lace, 

Told more of the past and its memories, 
Than that calm, passionless face. 

So to the treasured mementoes, 
She clings — the last of her race — 

And will die where she passed her girlhood 
Of her story leaving no trace. 

She waved us a last "Adois" 

From the casa's open door, 
Round which the tall, grim cacti 

Stood like sentinels of war. 

And her words like vespers linger, 
With the spell that about her lay 

Sweet, courtly Donna Maria 
The once "Belle of Monterey."

But autumn, the radiant year-cycle 's last comer, 
Bears, clustered in purple, the grape which is

Gold, in thy rock-girded fastnesses hidden, 
The magic of science shall wrest from its store ; 

Insatiate progress, advancing, has bidden 
That bounty of earth be for man evermore : 

For man as a trust and a torch, not to squander 
In riotous revel through profitless years, 

But a power that bids him to pause and to ponder 
On being and beauty, on triumph and tears ! 

Here, here where the breezes of freedom are blowing, 

Shall beauty burst into full flow 'rage to-day, 
And the will to do right shall, in proud hearts, be

The eagle's empire and the falcon's home — 
Far down, the galleons of sunset roam ;

Where cold sierras gleam like scattered foam. 

And least of all he holds the human swarm —

When, poised above the caldrons of the storm, 
Their hearts, contemptuous of death, shall dare

TO SAN FRANCISCO 

SAMUEL JOHN ALEXANDER 

If we dreamed that we loved Her aforetime, 'twas the 

ghost of a dream ; for I vow 
By the splendour of God in the highest, we never have 

loved Her till now. 
When Love bears the trumpet of Honour, oh, highest 

and clearest he calls, 
"With the light of the naming of towers, and the 

sound of the rending of walls. 
When Love wears the purple of Sorrow, and kneels 

at the altar of Grief, 
Of the flowers that spring in his footsteps, the white 

flower of Service is chief. 
As a flower on the snow of Her bosom, as a star in 

the night of Her hair, 
We bring to our Mother such token as the time and 

elements spare. 

If we dreamed that we loved Her aforetime, adoring 

we kneel to Her now, 
When the golden fruit of the ages falls, swept by the 

wind from the bough. 
The beautiful dwelling is shattered, wherein, as a 

queen at the feast, 
In gems of the barbaric tropics and silks of the 

ultimate East, 
Our Mother sat throned and triumphant, with the 

wise and the great in their day. 
They were captains, and princes, and rulers ; but 

She, She was greater than they. 

We are sprung from the builders of nations ; by the 

souls of our fathers we swear, 
By the depths of the deeps that surround Her, by the 

height of the heights She may dare, 
Though the Twelve league in compact against Her, 

though the sea gods cry out in their wrath.

VERSE BY CALIFORNIA POETS 



Though the earth gods, grown drunk of their fury, 
fling the hilltops abroad in Her path, 

Our Mother of masterful children shall sit on Her 
throne as of yore, 

"With Her old robes of purple about Her, and crowned 
with the crowns that She wore. 

She shall sit at the gates of the world, where the 

nations shall gather and meet, 
And the East and the West at Her bidding shall lie 

in a leash at Her feet. 



THE SHRINE OP SONG 

LOUIS ALEXANDER ROBERTSON 

In mute amazement oft I pause before 

The portals of Song's shrine and list to those 
"Whose music from its classic cloisters flows 

Adown the tide of Time for evermore. 

I see the place that no man may explore, 
Save him whose Art its life to Genius owes, 
On whose rapt lips the sacred cinder glows 

That teaches Song's sweet shibboleth and lore. 

Ah, it were heaven to enter in and kneel 
In some dim aisle, unnoticed and apart, 
"With thirsting soul to drink the sounds 
that shame 
My songs to silence ; then to rise and feel 
That my untutored lips had learnt the art 
That seats the singer in the House of Fame !

THE ROSARY 

ROBERT CAMERON ROGERS 

The hours I spent with thee, dear heart, 
Are as a string of pearls to me : 

I count them over every one apart, 
My Eosary, my Rosary. 

Each hour a pearl, each pearl a prayer, 
To still a heart in absence wrung : 

I tell each bead unto the end, 
And there a cross is hung ! 

memories that bless and burn ! 
O barren gain and bitter loss ! 

1 kiss each bead, and strive at last to learn 
To kiss the cross ; sweetheart ! to kiss the 

cross.

I love the saintly chant of the winds touching their 

odorous fingers to the harp of the angel, spring ; 
I love the undiscording sound of thousands of birds, 

whose concord of song echoes on the rivulet afar ; 
I muse on the solemn mountain which waits in sound 

content for the time when the Lord calls forth ; 
I roam with the wings of high-raised fantasy in the 

pure Universe ; 
Oh, I chant of the Garden of Adam and Eve !

THE WOLVES OF THE SEA 

HERBERT BASHFORD 

From dusk until dawn they are hurrying on, 

Unf etterd and fearless they flee ; 
From morn until eve they plunder and thieve — 

The hungry, white wolves of the Sea ! 

With never a rest, they race to the west, 

To the Orient's rim do they run ; 
By the berg and the floe of the northland|they 
go 

And away to the isles of the sun. 

They wail at the moon from the desolate dune 
Till the air has grown dank with their breath ; 

They snarl at the stars from the treacherous 
bars 
Of the coasts that are haunted by Death. 

They grapple and bite in a keen, mad delight 
As they feed on the bosom of Grief ; 

And one steals away to a cave with his prey, 
And one to the rocks of the reef. 

With the froth on their lips they follow the 
ships, 
Each striving to lead in the chase ; 
Since loosed by the hand of the King of their 
band 
They have known but the rush of the race. 

They are shaggy and old, vet as mighty and 

' bold 

As when God's freshest gale set them free ; 
Not a sail is unfurled in a port of |the world 

But is prey for the wolves of the Sea !

A DREAM OF BEAUTY 

CLARK ASHTON SMITH 

I dreamed that each most lovely, perfect thing 
That Nature hath, of sound, and form, and 

hue — 
The winds, the grass, the light-concentering 
dew, 
The gleam and swiftness of the sea-bird's wing; 
Blueness of sea and sky, and gold of storm 
Transmuted by the sunset, and the flame 
Of autumn-colored leaves, before me came, 
And, meeting, merged to one diviner form. 

Incarnate Beauty 'twas, whose spirit thrills 
Through glaucous ocean and the greener hills, 
And in the cloud-bewildered peaks is pent. 

Like some descended star she hovered o'er, 
But as I gazed, in doubt and wonderment, 
Mine eyes were dazzled, and I saw no more. 



WOMEN'S EYES 

ARTHUR WILLIAM RYDER 

The world is full of women's eyes, 
Defiant, filled with shy surprise, 
Demure, a little overfree, 
Or simply sparkling roguishly ; 
It seems a gorgeous lily-bed, 
Whichever way I turn my head.

THE GOBLIN LAUGH 

EDWIN MARKHAM 

When I behold how men and women grind 
And grovel for some place of pomp or power, 
To shine and circle through a crumbling hour, 

Forgetting the large mansions of the mind, 

That are the rest and shelter of mankind ; 
And when I see them come with wearied brains 
Pallid and powerless to enjoy their gains, 

I seem to hear a goblin laugh unwind. 

And then a memory sends upon its billow 
Thoughts of a singer wise enough to play, 
Who took life as a lightsome holiday : 
Oft have I seen him make his arm a pillow, 
Drink from his hand, and with a pipe of willow 
Blow a wild music down a woodland way.

THE AWAKENING 

CHRISTIAN BINKLEY 

I see the mystery of life anew, 

Bright angels have passed by me : I have heard 

A whirr of wings, and voices in adieu. 

Now all that seems is hushed, scarcely are stirred 

The curtains of the soul, and all things seem 

Brooding, and big with portents like the night. 

But now I thought I saw the distant gleam 

Of angel pinions in the western light, 

And heard the fading music : then it rolled 

In floods of living sound ; and as they swept 

Around, in whispered awe they spoke and told 

The secrets of the universe. I kept 

The fragments that I heard : now all things are 

Lit with a glory not of sun or star.

Of weary captives and the clamorous throng 

Up the broad streets; the Senate's proud acclaim; 
The storied Column, writ with woe and wrong ; 

The breathing marble, and the drooping bay, 

And- the last heart-throes of the Nation's pain,

VIVEROLS 

DAVID STARE JORDAN 

Beyond the sea, I know not where, 
There is a town called Viverols ; 
I know not if 'tis near or far, 
I know not what its features are, 
I only know 'tis Viverols. 

I know not if its ancient walls 
By vine and moss be overgrown ; 

I know not if the night-owl calls . 
From feudal battlements of stone 
Inhabited by him alone ; 

I know not if mid meadow-lands 
Knee-deep in corn stands Viverols ; 

I know not if prosperity 

Has robbed its life of poesy. 
It could not be in Viverols, 
They would not call it Viverols. 

Perchance upon its terraced heights 

The grapes grow purple in the sun ; 
Or down its wild untrodden crags, 
Its broken cliffs and frost-bit jags, 
The mountain brooks unfettered run. 

I cannot fancy Viverols 

A place of gaudy pomp and show, 
A ' ' Grand Establishment des Eaux, ' ' 
"Where to win back their withered lives 

The roues of the city go. 

Nor yet a place where poverty 
No ray of happiness lets in ; 
Where wanders hopeless beggary 
Mid scenes of sorrow, want and sin, 
It cannot be in Viverols, 
There 's life and cheer in Viverols !

Perhaps among the clouds it lies 

Mid vapors out from Dreamland blown ; 
Built up from vague remembrances 
That never yet had form in stone 
Its castles built of cloud alone. 

I only know, should you and I 

Through its old walls of crumbling stone 
With moss and ivy overgrown 
Together wander all alone, 

No spot on Earth could be more fair 

Than ivy-covered Viverols ; 
No grass be greener anywhere 
No bluer sky, nor softer air 

Than we should find in Viverols, 

Together find in Viverols. 

Love, we may wander far or near, 

The sun shines o 'er Viverols, 
Green is the grass, the skies are clear : 
No clouds obscure our pathway, dear, 

Where Love is there is Viverols, 

There is no other Viverols.

The ebbing tide of the summer time 
In mellow music of days and hours

A stifled brook, and a throb of yearning 

In all that changes for all that goes !

Be stranded and wrecked, ere the victory's won, 
Let the current sweep by us ! death ! Come and

What if laggards win praise, if the cause shall go on ?

TO THE AVERAGE MAN 

WALLACE IRWIN 

The Average Man wears the average clothes 

And the average hat on his head ; 
He eats at a table and sits on a chair 

And (normally) sleeps on a bed ; 
For he scorns the eccentric, and never would dare 
To sleep on a table or eat on a chair. 

The Average Man seeks the corner saloon 

Omeric refreshment to find ; 
But, shunning the tipple, he wanders to church 

Where he is devoutly inclined — 
Nor does he expect to find whiskey or dice 
In the place that is famed for religious advice. 

The Average Man says the average things 

And sings just the average songs ; 
He 's deucedly fond of the Average Girl, 

For whom he unceasingly longs — 
And his vices and virtues, too many to tell, 
Are oddly at odds — but they average well. 

Statistics declare that the Average Man 
Finds the Average Woman and mates ; 

That the Average Family, children all told, 
Is something like two and three-eighths. 

(Though fractional children disturb and appal, 

The Average Man isn't worried at all.) 

The Average Man reads the average books, 
And sometimes he writes 'em, I hear ; 

He's neither a genius, a knave, nor a fool, 
In fact he despises the queer ; 

For if he departed the Average Plan 

He 'd cease to be known as the Average Man.

The passions of ages are swirled, 
And the loves and the hates of the Average Man

Is in keeping the Man and the Average high.

They sail away over the slumber sea, 

And the pilot ? None can tell. 
But who may the crew and the passengers be ? 
There 's Tommy and Elsie, and several wee 

Little scamps that we know well. 

With the whitest of carpets the decks are spread 

And guarded with golden rails ; 
Old Santa Claus is the figurehead, — 
And soft by a lullaby air they're sped 

That billows the misty sails.

Children with angel wings half furled, 
Who find like you that the sun shines strong, 
Who at times like you for the soft rain long. 

There are children, Sweet, of an older age, 
Who have watched life's miracles stage by stage, 
To whom the day seems blank and bare, 
And the night and the rain-drops sweet and fair.

And the only check to the tears we weep 

Is the thought that night will come — and sleep !

NORA MAY FRENCH 

My thoughts of you . . . although I strain and sigh 
At stubborn roots, at boughs that tear my face, 

No plants in all my garden grow so high, 
Nor fill with sturdier life a wider place. 

It pleases me, and wakes an old delight, 
To go with wordy shears in idle times 

And trim them as a patient gardener might, 
Clipping the thorny boughs to curves and rhymes. 

If these were all, opposing strength with strength 
To make my hurt an easier thing to bear ; 

If these alone usurped my garden's length, 
It would not be so hard — I should not care. 

But close against the ground, oh, small and weak ! 

The trodden flowers, the little memories, grow. 
Uprooting fingers press them to my cheek. . . . 

Dear heart, I love you, and I miss you so.

But what of it — What matters that 
The chastened page be rudely blotted out 
By hands that ever faltered as they wrote ; 
That ere the cruel ink was scarcely dry, 
Hot tears erased the shameful entry ? 

Nay the thing has passed 

And deep within the glowing embers lies 

The substance — and the form 

Ethereal shapes assume that seem, withal, 

On golden pinions to have taken flight

WHEN THE BABY DIED 

A. J. WATEEHOUSE 

When the baby died, so fair was she — 
Like a lily an angel had dropped for me — 
That I said to myself : ' ' She is only asleep, ' ' 
And I wondered that others would over her weep : 
And I stooped and kissed her, half dreaming she 
Would open her blue eyes unto me, 
And laugh again as on yesterday, 
And dimple and croon in the dear old way— 
When the baby died. 

When the baby died I could not weep, 
And I said : ' ' She is only asleep — asleep 
She will wake ere long and I shall hear 
The prattle I love beat on my ear. ' ' 
And I smoothed all gently the golden hair, 
And I would not believe she was otherwhere 
As I cried, ' ' My darling, look up and see ! " 
But only the night wind answered me — 
When the baby died. 

When the baby died — sometimes I start ' 
Prom a dream at night with a longing heart, 
For I fancy I hear through the silence wide 
A prattle of words from the babe that died. 
Then my hands fell down, though empty they be, 
For I know that my darling has gone from me, 
And the night creeps into a somber day, 
While my heart cries out : "Come back, I pray"— 
Since the baby died.

In the heart of the day — 

Then I longed for a mate and the gift of wings,

To thwart my lust for the sky,

For the visions that die.

Strange winnower in wide dim vales of air,

Lay hands of blest remembrance 

On my head ? 
I gaze into the dimness — 

Does there grow, beyond my seeing, 
The fair light of stars ? 
I know not — but Thou knowest — 
Thou, to whom tomorrow is to-day — 
I rest in Thee. 
Deal gently with my years. 



WHEN I AM GONE 

ISABEL PIXLEY 

When I am gone and the grass grows green 
O'er the couch where I'm laid to rest, 
Will you seek that spot, with a kindly thought 
For the one that loved you best ? 

If you do, and you shed but a single tear, 
Though I cannot stretch forth my hand, 
A violet blue shall smile up at you 
To tell you I understand.

MY RETREAT 

ALBERT J. ATKINS 

There is a garden in my heart, 
A place from all the world apart, 
Where I alone in sorrow move, 
Awaiting her whose name is Love ; 
Here in my hour of deepest night 
I turn to find her beacon light. 

Sometimes I feel an inner gleam 
Of Love's true light, a steadfast beam; 
Then comes to me a low, sweet voice, 
Which makes my longing soul rejoice ; 
A message brings of strength, of might, 
That gives me courage for the fight. 

When weary with the outward strife, 
I seek this sacred inner life, 
And find within its calm repose, 
A brief surcease from earthly woes ; 
Thus, in the garden of my heart, 
I rest from all the world apart. 



WHOM DOES SHE LOVE? 

ARTHUR WILLIAM RYDER 

With one she gossips full of art ; 

Her glances with a second flirt ; 
She holds another in her heart : 

Whom does she love enough to hurt ?

SISTERS OF THE LITTLE SORROWS 

JULIET WILBOR TOMPKINS 

Prom visions of gray to morrows, 
All patient and sore dismayed, 
Come ye of the Little Sorrows, 
To whom no tears are paid : 
The hurt, who may not stagger, 

Who dare not nurse their stings — 
For wounds are of sword and dagger, 
And thorns are little things ! 

'Tis only your beauty failing, 

The youth of your heart grown numb 1 
Ah, sisters, we sit bewailing 
Your daily martyrdom : 

And she who treads the city 

With feet that mourn the wild, 
She shares our aching pity ; 
And she who bears no child ; 

And she of the crumbling altars ; 

And she who must earn her bread 
By paths where the spirit falters ; 
And she whose friend is dead ; 
And she who 'd fain recover 

The spendthrift days that were ; 
And the heart that found no lover — 
Kind Lord, they laugh at her ! 

The wounds that are not of sabres 

Shall never be understood, 
But pity may ease your labors, 
patient Sisterhood ! 
For there be hearts no sadder, 

Nor truer right to mourn, 
Though the wasp is not the adder, 
One- dies not of the thorn.

DAFFODILS 

GEACE HIBBARD 

"If I had but two loaves of bread, I would sell one and 
buy hyacinths. ' ' — The Koran. 

daffodils, bright daffodils, 

I'd sell my other loaf for thee. 
Thou art so sweet,. I love thee so, 

That thou art soul-bread unto me. 

I've placed thee in a crystal vase, 

As clear as crystal vase can be ; 
Hold high thy pretty yellow heads, 

While I a story tell to thee. 

Once up each side a garden path 
Two lines of daffodils did stray, 

Two golden chains of memory, 
That link my childhood with to-day. 

Up to an old colonial house, 

From gate to doorsill, side by side, 

Were daffodils in yellow gowns, 

Gay daffodils — New England's pride. 

A little girl stood in the door, 

Her heart was filled with love for thee, 

First garden flowers of the spring, 
daffodils, that girl was me.

CONFUSION 

E. F. GREEN 

Pretty Jennie came to me, 

Anxious, seeking information. 
' ' Show me, Richard, will you please, 

What is meant by osculation ? ' ' 

What could mortal man as I 

Do in such a situation, 
Father, Mother, no one by ; 

Liberal views, a strong temptation ? 

Jennie is my cousin, too. 

So, to please my young relation — 
' ' Oh, you horrid thing, there now, 

I referred to oceultation. ' ' 

AN INDIAN VERSE 

TRANSLATED FROM LANGUAGE CALIFORNIA INDIANS 
BY HU MAXWELL 

Darling mine, sweet mine, we sever. 

I am going far from thee. 
Must this parting be forever 1 

Shall we stroll beside the sea 
Any more ? The sea breeze blowing 

Soft I feel upon my brow ; 
And I see the lightning glowing 

On the distant mountain now ; 
And the verdant valleys under 

All the hills are gleaming bright, 
Lit by lightning, while the thunder, 

Dull and mournful, blends with night. 
And, alas ! thou art not near me, 

And my soul is sad and lone ! 
Fare thee well. Thou canst not hear me — 

All my joy and bliss are flown.

THE STREAM OF LIFE 

LILIAN LAUFERTY 

Unknowingly, unceasingly, still day by day they pass 

us by — 
Those friends whom we shall never know — comrades 

to whom our spirits cry. 
A little child may shyly smile, a gray haired man 

may kindly glance ; 
But smiling still, they pass the while, and life bears 

on its puppet dance. 

Perhaps that girl with eyes sea gray might be a 

comrade soul to me ; 
That lad of spirit blithe and gay may hold to 

friendship 's shrine the key. 
But still the stream of life flows by — flows by to some 

unchartered sea ; 
A comrade spirit greets the eye, then sweeps away 

eternally. 

With laggard step or joyful feet, at every turn 

throughout the day 
"We pass, but we may never meet, for still convention 

holds her sway. 
Brothers and sisters all, they claim — perhaps, but 

'tis a weary while. 
Since man has dared, unknowing shame, to greet his 

fellows with a smile. 



THE CHANGE 

CHARLES PHILIP NETTLETON 

Unconsciously we wail with life 's first breath, 
So dark and dure the past throws down its shade ; 
But ripening years to strength and peace persuade 

Our souls, and consciously, we smile at death.

THE SPIRIT OF CALIFORNIA 

EUFUS STEELE 

I am Ariel freed of a master ; 

I am Puck lacking Oberon's ban ; 

When the lotus is ripe, hark my Pandean pipe 

For I 'm Peter the godchild of Pan. 

I am Iris, my brush is a rainbow ; 

Endymion awakened am I ; 

In the breast of the tree Hamadryad I be — 

With Sequoia I tickle the sky ! 

In the orchard I hang my round beacons — 

Ah, Calypso, less potent thy lute ! 

And men come to seize and lean strip my trees, 

For I'm nectar that sweetens the fruit. 

My breath have I blown on the melon : 

When the honey bee, laden, starts home 

I follow his tracks, leave my kiss on his wax : 

The poppy I 've sprinkled with chrome. 

I mask me in gold in the wheat-fields, 

And I laugh at the reaper's sure tread — 

The sheaves are alined, it is me they would bind : 

I am soul of the grain, I am bread. 

In autumn men seek me in vineyards ; 

The purple which lures them is mine — 

"The capture is nigh; quick, the press !" is their cry: 

I am blood of the grape, I am wine. 

0, I 'm secret of life-giving rivers ; 

I am balm that exhales from Health's cave: 

Consumed in each kernel, I live on eternal, 

I am Master of Life, I'm its Slave. 

From the battlements of the Sierra 

The Pandean pipe I swing free, 

And my far-floating tune, in the stillness of noon, 

Weaves a spell from the peaks to the sea.

SONG OP THE OUT-OF-DOORS 

HERBERT BASHFORD 

Come with me, you world-weary, to the haunts 
of thrush and veery, 
To the cedar 's dim cathedral and the palace of 
the pine ; 
Let the soul within you capture something of the 
wildwood rapture, 
Something of the epic passion of that harmony 
divine ! 
Down the pathway let us follow through the 
hemlocks to the hollow, 
To the woven, vine-wound thickets in the 
twilight' vague and old, 
While the streamlet winding after is a trail of 
silver laughter, 
And the boughs above hint softly of the melodies 
they hold. 
Through the forest, never caring what the way 
our feet are faring, 
"We shall hear the wild birds ' revel in the 
labyrinth of Tune, 
And on mossy carpets tarry in His temples cool 
and airy, 
Hung with silence and the splendid, amber 
tapestry of noon. 
Leave the hard heart of the city, with its poverty 
of pity, 
Leave the folly and the fashion wearing out the 
faith of men, 
Breathe the breath of life blown over upland 
meadows white with clover, 
And with childhood's clearer vision see the 
face of God again !

The Poet of "The Fire Bringer" 

HBRBEET HERON 

Dead ! and we gaze, unseeing, on your bier, 

Where westward thunders roll ; 
But though you die, your living song is clear 

(Prometheus lights your goal) ; 
And till we too are taken, we can hear 

That music from your soul ! 



'THE GREATEST OP THESE IS CHARITY' 

HARRIET M. SKIDMORE 

Three kindly angels, crowned with light, 
Illumine our way through darkest night. 
Safe shall they rest in realms above 
Who follow Faith, and Hope, and Love. 

But Hope must die, her mission done, 
Where blissful certainty is won. 
And Faith, when "face to face" we see, 
Is lost in glad Reality. 

One f adeth not, one dieth ne 'er, — 
But, robed in Heavenly radiance fair, 
Shall keep through endless years above 
Her glorious name — Immortal Love !

GLOSE UPON A RUBA'IY 

PORTER GARNETT 

"A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, 
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread — and Thou 

Beside me singing in the Wilderness — 
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!" 



Oft have the footsteps of my Soul been led 
By thee, sweet Omar, far from hum of toil 

To where the Chenar trees their plumage spread 
And tangly vines of wild-grape thickest coil ; 

Where distant fields, scarce glimpst in noon 
content, 
Are lush with verdure quick upon the plough ; 

Where trill of Nightingale beneath the Tent 

Of heaven sinks away to soft lament ; — 

There have I sat with Thee and conned ere now 
A Book of Verses underneath the Bough. 

When from the city's raucous din new-freed 

I quaff thy wisdom from the Clearing Cup 
Of Eubaiyat, then, even as I read, 

I seem with Thee, in Persian groves to sup 
On bread of Yezdakhast and Shiraz Wine 

That lifts the net of Care from off the brow. 
These words, that tongue the Spirit of the Vine, 
Break from the Veil, and lo ! the Voice is thine : 

Then is my wish — would Fate that wish 
allow ! — 

A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread — and Thou. 

Although I tread the Wilderness of life, 
Thy song can waft me to that careless clime, 

Where enter in nor memories of strife, 
Nor ghosts of woe from out the Gulf of Time.

PRESENT PERIOD 1890 TO 1915 



There, by thy side, great Omar, would I stray, 

And drink the Juice that has forgot the Press, 
(A Pot, the Potter shaped but Yesterday — 
To-morrow will it be but broken Clay?) 
With only Thee the toilsome-road to bless, 
Beside me singing in the Wilderness. 

When thou dost scorn the waste and mourn the 
Rose, 

That dies upon the world's too sinful breast, 
In thy disdain a wondrous beauty glows, 

Unfolding visions of a Life more blest. 
Then from thy Naishapur in Khorasan 

I seem to wander, though I know not how, 
Within the glittering gates of Jennistan, 
Supreme Shadukiam I wondering scan : 

Though still I walk the Wilderness, I vow ; — 

Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow ! 



THE POET 

INA COOLBRITH • 

He walks with God upon the hills ! 

And sees, each morn, the world arise 
New-bathed in light of paradise. 

He hears the laughter of her rills, 
Her melodies of many voices, 
And greets her while his heart rejoices. 

She, to his spirit undented, 

Makes answer as a little child ; 

Unveiled before his eyes she stands, 
And gives her secrets to his hands.

A LIFE 

EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS 

The strength of gentleness, the might of meekness, 

The glory of a courage unafraid, 

Were in her face and in her life displayed. 

A constant love, a tenderness for weakness, 

IN THE REDWOOD CANYONS 

LILLIAN H. SHUEY 

Down in the redwood canyons, cool and deep, 
The shadows of the forest ever sleep, 
The odorous redwoods, wet with fog and dew, 
Touch with the hay and mingle with the yew. 
Under the firs the red madrofia shines, 

The graceful tan oaks, fairest of them all, 
Lean lovingly unto the sturdy pines, 

In whose far tops the whistling blue-birds call. 

Here where the forest shadows ever sleep, 
The mountain lily lifts its chalice white, 
The myriad ferns hang draperies soft and light 

Thick on each mossy bank and watered steep, 
Where slender deer tread softly in the night, 

Down in the redwood canyons dark and deep.

NIGHT-SENTRIES 

GEORGE STERLING 

Ever, as sinks the day on sea or land, 

Called or uncalled you take your kindred posts. 
At helm and lever, wheel and switch you stand, 
On the world's wastes and melancholy coasts. 

Strength to the patient hand ! 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

Now roars the wrenching train along the dark : 

How many watchers guard the barren way, 
In signal-towers, at stammering keys, to mark 
"What word the whispering horizons say ! 

To all that see and hark, — 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

On ruthless streets, on by-ways sad with sin, 

(Half hated by the blinded ones you guard) 
Guard well, lest crime unheeded enter in ! 
The dark is cruel and the vigil hard. 

The hours of guilt begin. 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

Now reels the pulsing hull adown the sea : 

Gaze onward, anxious eyes, to mist or star ! 
Where foams the heaving highway wide and free ? 
Where wait the reef, the berg, the cape, the bar ? 

Whatever menace be, 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

Now the surf-rumble rides the midnight wind, 
And grave patrols are at the ocean-edge. 

Now soars the rocket where the billows grind, 
Discerned too late, on sunken shoal or ledge.

To all that seek and find, — 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

On lonely headlands gleam the lamps that warn, 
Star-steady, or a-blink like dragon-eyes. 
Govern your rays, or wake the giant horn 
Within the fog that welds the sea and skies ! 

Far distant runs the morn : 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
i May there be Light ! 

Now glow the lesser lamps in rooms of pain, 

Where nurse and doctor watch the joyless breath, 
Drawn in a sigh, and sighing lost again. 
Who waits without the threshhold, Life or Death? 

Reckon you loss or gain ? 
To all, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light ! 

Honor to you that guard our welfare now ! 

To you that constant in the past have stood ! 
To you by whom the future shall avow 
Unconquerable fortitude and good ! 

Upon the sleepless brow 
Of each, alert and faithful in the night, 
May there be Light !
