DEVAGHAN 

THE bells of Magdalen ringing, and the dusk 
Creeping in filmy veils about the trees, 
A winter sunset fading in the sky ; 

These things I shall remember when I die ; 
Your hair, just stirring in the cool night breeze. 
By the open window ; the crackle of a husk 

In the glowing fire, flaring yellow-white 

For one brief instant ; beech trees in November 

That fringe some sloping ploughland, Elsfield way; 

The white and crimson splendour of the May 
O'er shadow 'd waters : these I shall remember : 
And all the starry wonder of the night.

THE FAIRY LAND OF SHIPSGAR 

IN Shipscar beyond the wold the rivers run brown as beer, 
And the women are not cold, and the babes are darling and 
dear. 
The churches are white with praying, and the priests wear copes 

of gold, 
And the princes go clad in scarlet, fold upon splendid fold. 
And the youths have hair like daffodil in Shipscar over the wold. 

And in spring-time the apple-blossom foams there in a rosy cloud, 

Like a goddess with melting bosom over her shepherd-boy bowed, 

And the sunsets show wonderful crimson, they faint o'er the Occi- 
dent crests. 

When the flame of the great sun dims on Vandale and birds to their 
nests 

Flit, and the lazuline green of the hesperal heavens is spread 

And the moon like a lily is seen to lift up her beautiful head. 

Then the stars show their frail flower-faces like primroses honeved 
and pale. 

They glide in their own dancing-places as ships on Oceanus sail. 

Yea, all night long in their choirs the stars will go round and round. 

Their limbs of translucent fires are treading the heavenly ground. 

O, the beat, beat, beat of their dancing in their windy palaestras 
of gold. 

Their angelical aeromancing in Shipscar over the wold ! 

And the day from her chamber stealing in the uttermost gates of 

the morn, 
Is a mystery mild revealing eyes washed from sorrow and scorn. 



The Fairy Land of Shipscar 

Is a river of reconciling as her loveliness slow forth-streams 
Into gentlest slumber, beguiling the dallying daimon of dreams, 
Scattering wild white asters while the cocks clamour loud and far 
To the white prince healed of disasters, Lucifer the Auroran star. 

And the winds of the Spring bring dreams when from Araby softly 

they blow, 
And the thorn-tree buds by the streams into foam-stars of virginal 

snow, 
Bring dreams to the wonderful Queen in her castle beyond the 

world. 
Whose mantle of violet sheen with swans and lilies is pearled, 
And her orange hair rushes down to her beautiful slender feet. 
And beneath her exquisite crown her eyes like waters are sweet. 
And she dreams in her lazuline chamber of faces that once offered 

her 
Mysterious chaplets of amber and marvellous caskets of myrrh. 
And she dreams how the pikes shall be broken and the banners of 

tournament furled. 
And the faery peace-word spoken in her castle beyond the world. 
How the hearts of weary lovers shall kiss like doves in the end, 
And how when the veil uncovers, the face be the face of a Friend ! 
Ah me, the mild kisses unpassioned when Aperil sighs through the 

fret 
Of Oread anemones fashioned ere Chaos could night beget, 
Ere earth was severed from water and flame from the blue air cold. 
And the Father of all from his daughter in Shipscar beyond the 

wold! 



THE GERANIUMS 

IN empty towns, where no one ever comes, 
Behind the silent panes, pale petalled faces, 
Waxen, the guardian plants of shadowed places, 
Stand in stiff pots the sad geraniums. 

Vermeil and white, they faint in cloistral airs. 
Watching the small fires and the starved walls : 
Grey dawns affright them, clinging twilight falls 

Coldly about them, virgin dreams are theirs. 

Mirrors and solemn chests reflect their pride : 

Stones of dead streets and long-forgotten squares, 
Sad musty corners, subtly smelling stairs. 

Are by their painted blossoms sanctified. 



HISPANIOLA 

BLUE trees; the horned mountain looms behind, 
His huge foot in the sea, his crest of snows 
Flushed into mystery by the dying rose 
Of sunset and the frail faint-fingered wind. 

And ships like weary birds with trailing wings 
Drift homeward over the violet bleeding sea. 
Tall palms against the Sun's death mightily 
Lift their frayed crowns like lean barbarian Kings. 

And sad white cities by the burning waves 

Hear from gilt cupolas the bird-like call 

Of Marian bells announcing even-fall 

In ancient churches like gaunt perfumed caves. 

And a woman like a leopard, at whose breast 
A crimson rose burns like a splash of blood, 
Sits in a weary contemplative mood 
Confessing that after all Quiet is best I

THE STATION 

UNDER the heavy clock the moving crowd 
Circulates busily ; but here and there 
A group stands waiting, with a frequent glance 
Up at the silent dial : a porter, bowed 
Beneath his load, catches their casual stare; 
Pausing to shift the weight, misses his chance 
Of motioning them aside, for they have turned 
Back to their careless talk, and staggers round 
Another way. Slowly a heavier pile 
Trundles along, and the whole scene is churned 
Into a tangled mass until a sound 
Calms it again, bringing a mutual smile 
Of recognition, as a distant shriek 
Dies into rumbling clankings drawing near. 
Anticipation seems to isolate 

Each one again. Some feel that they must speak. 
Speak, and not scream, because of sudden fear 
Of this thing coming, a relentless fate, 
On, on, on, nearer as the seconds pass : 
It looms in sight, drowning the petty strain 
In admiration, sends through every nerve 
A glow of pride; under the smokc-slained glass 
The ponderous engine shoulders, and the train 
Slopes heavily to stillness round the curve.

ADVENT 

WHY make such terrible talk of thrones and flames 
And trumpets out of the void dark ? You know- 
God walked in a cool garden when the world 
Was at her birth, and in due time he bore 
The patient agony of her human shame 
Less on the cross than in a garden at eve. 
And so the end too shall be on quiet wise. 
God and the Lady Mary shall walk forth 
In the cool evening, and pluck some flowers 
To put them in their hands and their bright hair : 
But there are flowers that they will not pluck. 



TO N 

ALL day have I been busied about you 
And pondered over intimate ceremonial 
To crown love perfectly. To-night I know 
That love is perfected with contemplation, 
Served with calm worship and cool frankincense, 
And aureoled with the white spiritual fire 
Of his austerity : for Love is God. 

Word made flesh and born of woman, love 
Abiding with us, we behold thy glory, 

And know none other way of coronation 
Excepting thorns, excepting Golgotha. 

Because I have been busied about you 
To-dav, and seen love paramountly crowned 
With his own crown ; because the peril of thorns 
Is overcrowning you ; to-night I know 

1 shall not have my purpose of your beauty. 
Or find if that were happiness after all, 

I that am sorrv enough with love alrcadv. 



IS THE END STILL VERY FAR? 

Is the end still very far? Not very far, 
O my beloved. One more hill and vale 
And life is over like a pleasant tale 
Well told, and like the waning of a star 
Under the dawn : and we can lay us down 
And sleep awhile, and wake to hear the sea 
Sounding her passionate symphony 
Beneath us — finding in a little town, 
Where we shall free us out of all our stress, 
An argosy to lead us forth with singing 
And tread with gilded feet the water, bringing 
Our souls to fair isles of more gentleness, 
Where the white domes of fretted palaces 
Flash under crimson skies on quiet seas.

THE APPLE ORCHARD 

AN olden book is on my knee, 
And Italy's sky is shining 
About the casement of my room 
Where no sad fool is whining ; 
For love saith sorrow hath no sway, 
And soul hath no repining. 

O make a song upon a day 
When apple trees are blowing ; 
When maids go courtin' by the May, 
Eyes sweet where love is showing. 

An olden book is on my knee. 

Its pages quaintly telling 
Of clerks and knights and kingly pomp 

Alive in summer's dwelling. 
Where all the bees in haunted glades 

Are busy with their singing. 

O inake a song to dance ahvav 
When apple trees are blowing ; 
And you drink beer and suck a clay 
While cocks are loudly crowing. 

10 



The Apple Orchard 



Boccaccio's close were not more sweet 
Than the pleasaunce that I look on, 

Where marguerite and gillyflower 
Are nodding in profusion ; 

And love walks there in lily white 
Unto my sweet confusion. 

O glad my heart upon a day 
When apple trees are blowing; 
Fair x\moret is by the way 
With eyes of summer's showing. 



LOVE PLAYS IN THE SOUTH 

OYOU at play with winds in the South, 
Spare you ever a thought to' me 
As you watch the dance of the fickle sea 
In the breath of a wind-capped morn. 
Or have you flown to the mast of scorn, 
O you with your beauty and youth ? 

I never hear from you in the South — 

Not a whisper or word to say 
That it's ill or well with you to-day : 

Ah, have you forgotten so soon 
The days my threshold kissed the shoon 

Of your beauty and your youth? 

From Wytham looking to Oxford's towers — 

When Oxford is Italy, 
I think of a window known to me 

And brushed with lilac bloom : 
How within I had filled the scented room 

With full and splendid hours. 

And a voice I knew had tuned those hours 

To a key of richest tone 
That love in the South had never known 

Though He were in Italy : 
O you at play with the winds at sea 

Have you wished again they were ours? 

12 



Love Plays in the South 



But a silence broods — not yet, not yet, 

A whisper or word to say 
It's ill or well with you to-day : 

Or that you will remember soon 
How once you lingered to make a tune 

You know I can never forget.

THE AWAITERS OF THE ADVENT 

STRAINING last night to slip the gyve of fate 
And dream the unconditioned, my soul fell 
To that cold toneless utmost verge of hell 
Where the sick voices by the Ivory Gate 
Pray mumblingly " O Thou Predestinate, 
Slave of the world. Spirit intolerable, 
When will thy fire's returning miracle 
Impregnate Time, that we may love and hate?" 

These mutterings are of men long underground 

Who, when they knew the chain of hours and places, 
Contemned the comfortable body, and found 

More sweet chimaera's kiss. All night they sigh 
Numbly, thin lean lips stammering, and their faces 
Pale with the lust they did not satisfy.

THE SEA 

O FATHOMLESS, incurious Sea, 
What ails thee? 
Thou hast drawn down into thy deep. 
Strange-denizened profound of sleep 
All that is rich and rare and proudly tended. 
All that is homely, that is undefended. 
These things were ours, vain or desirable — 
Caskets of ebony whose jealous sable 
Enshrined some lovely friend, and ships of gold 
Freighted with fabled wealth, and all the old 
Sweet, customary things — these cannot slake 
A thirst so foreign. Wherefore dost thou take 
Neither to yield nor treasure, youth and age, 
Squalor and pomp alike for heritage? 
O fathomless, insatiate Sea, 
What ails thee? 



IS 



GOD'S FOOL 

WHAT said God's Fool to you ere he passed by, 
Pranked in a damasked robe, his cloak awry 
Vermeil and rose ; why did you bid him stay ; 
What wild thing said he, that you looked away 
And laughed all suddenly in strange inconsequence 
Ere he passed singing hence. 
And closed your fingers on a rose of gold 
Tossed mocking-wise into your grudging hold? 
What said God's Fool to you ere he passed by?" 

" He did but bid me fashion out of straw 
A lance to tilt defiance at the sky, 
And even as I laughed I saw 
The lovely dream of folly fade and die 
Unclaimed, in proud impenitence : 
Yet since I wear his golden rose of pain. 
Some day when I must fashion my defence, 
This shall God's Fool remember, nor disdain 
To claim me kin, when I come tardy by."

THE CALIPH WALKS 

To the small tavern what cloaked guests have come? 
The wine flows faster and more swift the jest, 
Madly the dancer answers pipe and drum, 
And now the hunched musicians play their best. 

Wrapped in their dark, the old blind beggars moan. 
Nor shall night heal their woe so often told. 
When suddenly in their midst a purse is thrown, 
And a queer knowledge cries that it is gold. 

Now old uxorious men feel quick alarm, 
For shadowy lutanists send a snatch of verse 
To float in at their window with strange charm, 
The casement closes to a growling curse. 

Along the street light laughter ripples down. 
And through the dusk an echo of delight 
Runs like a whisper through the drowsy town, 
Haroun the Caliph is abroad to-night.

THE GLASS OF WATER 

IF we could but forget by heart 
The many things we never knew, 
Should we not give a greater part 
To what is fanciful and true? 

In vain the cold museum tries 
To break with labels from its dream, 
But still a headless torso cries, 
Against our knowledge things yet seem. 

The pure conception grandly flings 
A path beyond the precipice, 
And soon a miracle of wings 
Will quit the sleeping chrysalis. 

The poet, calm above all age, 

Must be the actor with his fan. 

The swift horse, blossom, joy and rage, 

Within the booth of his Japan. 

Ah, could we win that ideal first. 
Clear water in the glass that stands 
Transparent, patient for all thirst. 
The lilies never grasped by hands ! 



IN BROGELIANDE 

IN the midst of the forest of silence, 
Where even the leaves are mute, 
Where never a bird wanders. 
She plays upon a lute. 

With fingers gently passing, 
She touches golden strings, 
Till the trees almost remember 
The long-departed wings. 

And the knights and the gay ladies. 
And the music that went before, 
And the days of joy and passion. 
They will find these things no more. 

One plaintive lute recalling 
The loud citoles and shawms. 
She alone has not left them. 
Of the beautiful, noble forms. 

If she would cease from playing, 
The people with hearts of stone 
Would lead her from the forest, 
And set her on a throne. 
19 



In Broceliande 



She would be bright with jewels, 
She would sit crowned on high, 
But if she left the forest, 
Alas, the trees would die. 

In the midst of the forest of silence. 
Where even the leaves are mute. 
Where never a bird wanders, 
She plays upon a lute.

<})iXous oXeVavTCS exaipous 

WITH us the sorrow : they are happy now, 
As all who sleep are happy, in forgetting 
Their pleasures past : Death cannot disendow 
Only — there's benefit in life-blood-letting. 
Only for us the sharp remembrance-sorrow 
In future pleasures, by their pleasure less : 
Nor pain nor pleasure is in thy to-morrow 
Thou dumb deliverer Forgetfulness ! 
Their rotting bodies rotting Flanders fields 
Will serve to swallow. Time will serve to stem 
Sorrow for them : to Time all sorrow yields. 
Weep while thou list, my heart, but not for them — 
Weep for thy pleasure in the love that ends 
With them, my pleasant fellowship of friends.

PLEADING 

ARE we not all as unknown merchantmen 
Come from a distant haven, freighted all 
With curious cargo of unsorted wares? 
And if the ensign wavering over us 
Chance at the first to be unrecognized, 
What matter? Surely nothing can ensure 
The worth of all the hidden merchandise 
Save but to see. And if without assay 
One have dismissed a sea-worn argosy, 
Deep-laden as the ships of old that came 
From Ophir, 

Wave-weary, seeking the long harbourage 
So often miraged in the clouds of hope. . . . 
Well! to the deep it must beat out again. 
Drive back into the weary silences. 

* * * * It- 
Why should one thwart the Sower as he sows, 
Or burn the furrows ere the seed be sprung 
Even to the tender blade? 

There might have come the full corn in the ear. 
Sighing before the slow soft winds of night, 
Full harvest for a splendid garnering. 

* * * * * 

Why should you bo but one more broken dream, 

A melancholy memory till the far 

Endings of the earth and faltering fall of life? 



22 



TENDEBAMQUE MANUS 

1SAW you stand beside me in that hour 
The infinite vision of the passing pain, 
Now weary eyes were closed, 
Sped arrowed fancy forth with all the power 
Of the bent bow whereon the breaking strain 
Had been at last imposed. 

Yet in your glance vainly I looked for shame 

To have mocked with measured love measureless need 

Or something deeper sprung 
From the soul's vast imaginative flame 
Through doubt's old darkness where the great pale weed 

Of obscurant wisdom clung. 

Endurance, ardour, faith, pursuit, nor prayer 
Availed; Love with hope's flying fire 

Lured to the marsh of doom. 
Embittered with the waters of despair. 
My spirit, baffled of the great desire. 

Fled to the lonelv gloom.

MEDITATION 

I SAW the stars against the summer night 
Still trembling as they trembled when the light 
First fell upon them from the further world. 

I could not bend my proud humanity 

To kneel before the cold immensity, 

I, who had youth and love, I, who could know — 

They — flotsam on the ethereal ebb and flow, 

Dead things unmoved by immaterial fire 

Of hope and anguish and divine desire. 

They were not more omnipotent than I, 

They could not see and dream and change and die. 

I could not bow before infinity, 

The silent grandeur could not conquer me.

FEBRUARY— A BRIGHT MORNING 

THE scent of the sun is in the air around us. 
Like the glimpse of a distant herald of victory, 
Whose laurelled brows proclaim the fear that bound us 
Is broken by our strong artillery. 
There is more power in the echoing feet 
Of passers in the newly-shining street. 

Beyond the houses from the high trees are calling 
Birds, and a whistling boy with shriller note 
Polishes a window with the water falling 
Sharply upon the slab. His well-worn coat 
Is open now. An interested girl 
At twenty smiles and smoothes a yellow curl. 

Dreams that were dying flash to full defiance 

Of the torpid cold content with that may be ; 

And the hearts of men renew the old alliance 

With sun and windy sky and rising sea. 

Who said despair shall perish with his despair, 

And leaves shall bud, and resurgent youth shall dare. 

Ere night perhaps the clouds will slow and thicken. 

It is far to spring, it is very far to spring, 

And flowers will die in frost, and hope will sicken. 

And many the days that serve the desperate king. 

But not uncertainly, joyous and brave. 

We shall meet at length around the old time's grave. 



25 



MARRIED 

A COOL white windy day. Grass and low hills. 
A dog? A noisy scaramouch. Alone! 
We have given too much in laughter and the thrills 
Of slight discovery. We have not known 
What this day promises, the uncurtained view 
Of perfect imperfection, God in growth. 
They lied who called Love cretin, and we knew 
Not that they lied ; we had forgot the oath. 
Pause and repeat : Neither by day nor night, 
At setting or uprising, shall we praise 
Our store of broken beauty. Travel light 
As beggars in the track of the new days. 
Life is a captive fairy, bidding gold. 
Jewels, strong incantations, to be free. 
Refused, he offers youth that grows not old. 
Immortal love. Refuse ! And we shall see 
The leprechaun Prometheus, heavens bend. 
Earth shudder. Take ! And turn the world to flame. 
Lo, the hearts' pilgrimage has holy end. 
And we have found — what has not yet a name.

PREMONITIONS 

THERE is a terror in the sky, 
A cloud before the moon. 
When I wonder winds reply, 
" Soon, very soon." 

My crumpled, hot and narrow bed 
No breathing space affords, 

As there were boards above my head 
And earth above the boards. 

There is a moaning from the sky, 
And hidden the pale moon. 

When I wonder winds reply, 
" Soon, very soon."

MEDITATION ON THE BERKSHIRE 
DOWNS 

DUSK. Long, low downs. A shepherd. Drowsy sheep.

That brims with slow, sad stars and silver sleep ; 
Lampless the way, yet luminous the soul.

Craving eternal wisdom, sought to pray. 
When from afar he heard an angel say : 
Thy spirit dwells with God — thou art the prayer.

Its silver in the mirror of the skies. . . .

MOLE 

TUNNELLED in solid blackness creeps, 
The old mole-soul and wakes or sleeps, 
He knows not which, but tunnels on 
Through ages of oblivion. 
Until at last the long constraint 
Of each-hand wall is lost, and faint 
Comes daylight creeping from afar ; 
And mole-work grows crepuscular. 
Tunnel meets air and bursts ; mole sees 
Men hugely walking ... or are they trees? 
And far horizons smoking blue 
And wandering clouds for ever new ; 
Green hills, like lighted lamps aglow 
Or quenching 'neath the cloud-shadow. 
Quenching and blazing turn by turn 
Spring's great green signals fitfully burn. 
Mole travels on, but finds the steering 
A harder task of pioneering 
Than when he thridded through the strait. 
Blind catacombs that ancient fate 
Had carved for him. Stupid and dumb 
And blind and touchless he had come 
A way without a turn ; but here 
Under the sky the passenger 
Chooses his own best way, and mole 
Distracted wanders ; yet his hole 
Regrets not much wherein he crept 
But runs, a joyous nympholept. 
This way and that, by all made mad : 
29 



Mole 



River nymph and Oread, 

Ocean's daughters and Lorelei 

Combing the silken mystery, 

The glaucous gold of her rivery tresses. . . 

Each haunts the traveller, each possesses 

The drunken wavering soul awhile. 

Then with a phantom's cock-crow smile 

Mocks craving with sheer vanishment. 

Mole-eyes grow hawk's ; knowledge is lent 

In grudging driblets that pay high 

Unconscionable usury 

To unrelenting life. Mole learns 

To travel more secure ; the turns 

Of his long way less puzzling seem 

And all those magic forms that gleam 

In airy invitation cheat 

Less often than they did of old. 

The earth slopes upward, fold on fold 

Of quiet hills that meet the gold 

Serenity of western skies. 

Over the world's edge with clear eyes 

Our mole transcendent sees his way 

Tunnelled in light. He must obey 

Necessity again and thrid 

Close catacombs as erst he did, 

Fate's tunnellings himself must bore 

Thorough the sunset's inmost core. 

The guiding walls to each-hand shine 

Luminous and crystalline ; 

And mole shall tunnel on and on 

Till night let fall oblivion.

THE PICTURE SHOP 

THE flow of the crowd is clotted here, 
A frictional point in the street's sleek conduit 
In the stream is an island; motionless faces peer 
In at the window of one of those shops, 
At which, though a shamed individual shunned it, 
A crowd of him gladly stops. 

Pictures of scarce-veiled opulence, 

A Dian slimness, a lolling pose : 

A welter of basest beastliest sense ; 

Or is it here that the dumb crowd knows 

God's beauteous immanence? 



31 



THE WHEEL 

WEARY of its own turning, 
Distressed with its own busy restlessness, 
Yearning to draw the circumferent pain — 
The rim that is dizzy with speed — 
To the motionless centre, there to rest. 
The Wheel must strain, through agony 
On agony contracting, returning 
Into the core of steel. 
And at last the Wheel has rest, is still. 
Shrunk to an adamant core. 
Fulfilling its will in fixity. 
But the yearning atoms, as they grind 
Closer and closer, more and more 
Fiercely together, beget 
A flaming fire upward leaping, 
Billowing out in a burning, 
Passionate, fierce desire to find 
The infinite calm of the Mother's breast. 
And there the flame is a Christ-child sleeping. 
Bright, tenderly radiant ; 
All bitterness lost in the infinite 
Peace of the Mother's bosom. 

But death comes creeping in a tide 
Of slow oblivion, till the flame in fear 
Wakes from the sleep of its quiet brightness 
And burns with a darkening passion and pain, 
Lest, all forgetting in quiet, it perish. 
32 



The Wheel 



And as it burns and anguishes it quickens, 
Begetting once again the Wheel that yearns — 
Sick with its speed — for the terrible stillness 
Of the adamant core and the steel-hard chain. 
And so once more 

Shall the wheel revolve, till its anguish cease 
In the iron anguish of fixity ; 
Till once again flame billows out to infinity, 
Sinking to a sleep of brightness 
In that vast oblivious peace.

FOR THOSE GONE FROM BY THE SEA 

THE Sea, the noontide, the receding song 
Of waves, withdrawing from the radiant shore, 
The bay, the harbour, where the old boats throng. 
Shall drowse their eyelids with noon-dreams, no more. 

The Sea, the moonlight, the majestic crash 
Of crystal billows on the jewelled beach. 
No more shall tell them of those Isles that flash 
And fade for ever from adventure's reach. 

North-wind's delirium, thunder's rolling rage, 
All the demented voices of the deep. 
Calling, lamenting them from age to age, 
Shall stir no eyelid of the sleep they sleep. 

A call they heard that came from overseas, 
And they, with shouts that made the tall cliffs shake. 
And songs that faded on the faint sea-breeze, 
Vanished, one evening, in the red sun's wake. 

And now they slumber on thy boundless breast, 
O pale Pacific, whom no ambient light 
Chaineth and straincth to her will's unrest. 
Whom no wind troubles in thy timeless night. 

Thou art their harbour and their open sea. . . . 
And no dim crying from that distant shore 
Shall end their roamings or their rest in thee, 
Their Ocean-sepulchre for evermore.

SONNET 

I LOVE the languor of late summer days, 
When dream-compelling perfumes richly steep 
The drowsed winds, and green mirages sleep 
In shimmering folds of opalescent haze; 

And motionless, pale kine forget to graze 
In the blue gloom of branches, drooping deep 
With wealth of emerald leaves the old trees weep 
For dateless woes, reviewed beneath noon's gaze. 

But when their wafted sorrowings are hushed, 

And they have yielded to the envied boon 

Of mingling in the world's white rapture brief, 

My life, in its loo human bondage crushed. 
Longs to invade the dolorous trees, and swoon 
In sylvan trance of unremembered grief.

PAN 

USES round the sacred spring 
Dance not always, neither sing. 
When they seek their white repose 
Helicon its scandals knows. 
Once the conversation ran 
On the parentage of Pan. 
" Why," said one, " you must agree 
Pan's the son of Dryope. 
Some afifirm the godlike goat — 
But you know the story to 't." 
Then a second, " Did not Zeus 
Phoebe's buxom maid seduce?" 
" Both are out," affirmed another; 
"Chaste Penelope's his mother; 
Oh, Odysseus, poor dear man, 
Little thinks of goatish Pan 
That, if his face few loves allures, 
'Tis the fault of all those wooers."

SONG 

IF Ocean were but filled with wine, 
Then were it my desire 
From out his caverns into mine 
To drain that crimson fire. 
Wherefore 'tis well, though not divine, 
That Ocean is not filled v.-ith wine.

THE GIRL 

IN the deep humoui- of maturing hours, 
When trees embosomed with their cloud of leaves 
Spcali summer to the winds, and fewest showers 
Subdue the light of lately-gathered sheaves, 
A girl lamented singly on a wold 
For that her joy had waned and life was cold. 

" That he should fly, 'tis nothing, but that love 
Once seen should turn to nothingness and kill 
The heart that nursed it as a treasure trove. 
Oh, this is the suj)reniacy of ill 

That reign'd where'er we glance, although its face 
Be masked in verdure and delicious grace. 

" I have had knowledge; what avails it now? 
I have had music, but the fount is dry ; 
Romance has wreathed the laurel for my brow 
And left me gazing on an empty sky, 
Pale with the disappearance of a god; 
My heart is what it is — a dusty clod." 

So moaned she in disjointed utterance. 
Scarce conscious of the folly of her pain, 
For she was one trained in the crooked dance 
Of intellectual subtlety and sane 
Philosophy had yielded comfort one. 
To ponder on the evil that was done. 
38 



The Girl 



When of a sudden came a gentle wind, 
Chafing the airy damask of her cheek. 
" It was not he," she cried, " but I that sinned; 
The joy I sought, it was not there to seek. 
The world's a meeting place of storm and ease, 
And love is but a mystical disease. 

"We live to laugh; laughter's the sum of things. 
Take thou my kisses, wind, for now I see 
That utter human disappointment springs 
From a desire of Christian charity. 
Out, out, fond kindness, I will be as earth — 
Pagan, abandoned unto solar mirth." 

Her eyes leapt up, her hair broke forth, her feet 

Tiptoed the vivid grasses ; angular 

Her hand went to her brow ; a dazzling fleet 

Of birds was driving leisurely afar. 

Was it for her this vision ? Could it be 

A sweet reward for her late blasphemy? 

Ere she could reach unto the end of thought 
A voice was in the blue, " Thou art approved, 
Daughter of satisfaction. It is nought 
The sorrow that thou bredst from thy beloved. 
I am the radiance of the early day. 
Warm thou thy body in the word I say. 

" Madonna Cytherea is my name; 
Be that enough." 'Twas gone, the sunny birds. 
Sparrows and wrens were chirruping ; aflame 
She wondered on a flood of eager words — 
"A dream? She spoke, her eyes, her accent mild 
Are known to me, long known ; and yet no child ! 
39 



The Girl 



" I need no lover for I have seen love. 

My house is everywhere in this gay world ; 

The dearest exultation is to rove 

A beam from some awakening planet hurled. 

Yes, 'tis a beam, an ecstasy I am : 

To learn the truth upon this wold I came. 

" Amiable adoration of the skies. 
On us, as on a thousand, hast thou shined. 
That I should wash me in thy limpid eyes, 
And gladsome be that I was one time blind. 
Silence be now my theme, the joyousness 
Of meditation on my eyelids press." 

So saying, she descended from the wold, 

A rapture breathing wheresoe'er she passed, 

And meeting him whose heart had struck hers cold 

A thankful look upon his forehead cast. 

He bowed, and she went on, all jubilant 

At the achievement of her life's romaunt.

PAX ROMANA 

TALL in your sunlit acres, 
Quiet among your trees, 
Or cool and calm in your garden 
When summer scatters the bees, 

In your high white-walled parlours 
There breathes no echo of song. 
But dim through the folded curtains 
The dav, drifting along. 

Ploughing, sowing, and reaping. 
And over the fertile ground. 
From harvest on into harvest. 
The seasons following round. 

You will die unremembered, 

But your land will not die, 

And still shall be red wheat stretching 

Betvi^een a sky and a sky.

OCTOBER 

1HAVE proved your strength as naught, your faith as dust about 
the door 
Blown by expediency now here, now there, 
And resting never ; but from fear 
Of some discomfort you cast into night 
The Truth that makes the lives of men — and more— 
Than this, you set your eyes away from light. 
And fixed them in the little things that lay 
About your feet, and are in God's eyes as the salt sea spray. 

And still I love you — strangely, stubbornly — it will not die 
This hunger for the sight and touch of you, 
For all those wizard ways you knew 
To still the heart ache that would never sleep 
Quite quietly for what might lie 
Hidden behind the Future — Strangely deeji 
The stillness of the ecstacy you brought 

With those dear lips — a quiet more profound than sleep or death 
or thought.

FRAGMENT FROM "THE 
WANDERER" 

THE sea darkens. The waves rave and rush. 
The wind rises. The last birds haste. 
One star quakes above ; the flush 
Of yellow dies down behind the waste. 

I look on the deepcnin;^ sky, 

The chill star, the forlorn sea breaking. 

For what does my spirit cry? 

For what is my heart so aching? 

Is it home? But I have no home. 
Is it tears? But I no more weep. 
Is it love? Love went by dumb. 
Is it sleep? But I would not sleep. 

So alone, O suul, upun earth. 

So alone twixt the sky and the deep : 

No love and no lover worth 

The bondage of tears and of sleep. 

Must I fare, then, in fear and in fever 
On a journey become thrice far. 
Whose sun has gone down for ever? 
Whose night brings no guiding star? 
43 



From *' The Wanderer " 



The wind roars and an ashen beam 
Waving up shrinks away in haste. 
The waves crash. The star's trickling beam 
Travels the warring waste. 

I look up : in the windy height 
The star's orb serene and afar 
Shakes overbrimmed with her light. 
Beauty, be Thou my star !

FOUNTAIN SONG FROM ''THE 
PRINCE OF ORMUZ" 

MY rose before ever the three tears were shed 
I wished He in its bosom has fallen apart, 
Off their snapped golden hair all my pure pearls hav'o sped 
Before their mid ruby could burn on mv heart. 
To-day is as yesterday : as to-day so to-morrow, 
But fallen my rose, pearls, tears 

Fallen in sorrow ; 
Or ever I woke it was sunset to-day, 
As fast flows the fountain as fast flows away. 

As fast fall away 
My pearls and my tears, my rose and my sorrow. 



45 



LEONORE 

DARK, calm-eyed Leonore loved 
Rich roses deep and red. 
Her still hand held one carmine 
Beside her dusky head. 

.She had lakcn it from the bow! 
Mellow white traced with blue, 
Set on the tablet's lustrous 
Level between us two. 

As twilight fell her darkling look 
Into my soul she bent. 
Deeper her great eyes' languor was 
Than the hushed roses' scent. 

With June's moon Leonore stole out 
Into the warm still mist. 
Nought but the lonely fog floats in 
To renew the long tryst. 

Two crimson petals fall and then n hush, 
And lo ! two fall again. 
How slow and red the petals drip ! — 
Symbols of love and pain.

"THE SOIL HATH SMUTGH'D IT" 

REMORSEFUL, my Beloved, you! 
And am not I remorseful too? 
But O, it has been said, 
It has been said — 

The bitter thought has come to bitter birth, 
And nothing worth 
Is our regret. 
We shall forget, 
But O, it has been said, 
It has been said — 
Better our love were dead !

THE TOWN 

THE monster Town sprawls underneath the niijht 
His jagged back of touzled alley-ways, 
With here and there an eye of shuttered light, 
Half-blind, peering athwart the waste of dark. 

For night is the Beast's rest; when day is done 

His panting breath grows hushed, and his huge limbs 

Loosen relaxed, until another sun 
Kindles the fever of another day. 

Couched in uneasy sleep he lies, and hears 

In spite of sleep, through troubled dreams, the cries 

Of raging souls in vain, and stilled tears 
Of beaten souls that whimper into sleep. 

And still the mount of vision stands and calls 
Leaning to rescue, till the sleeping Beast, 

With a heave of streets and squares and prisoning walls, 
Stirs, blindly groping towards the beckoning hand.

"LE DORMEUR DU VAL" 

(Arthur Rimbaud) 

THROUGH the green vale the crazy streamlets run, 
Trailing their silver ribbons, and in pride 
The light leaps down over the mountain-side : 
A tiny hollow, shimmering in the sun. 

A trooper — ycung, mouth open and bared head, 
Slumbers ; the blue cress bathes him where he lies 
Flung in the grass, and dreams beneath the skies, 

Drenched with the sunlight, pale on his green bed. 

He lies, his feet among the corn-flags deep. 

And smiles in dreams like a sick child asleep. . . . 

Cradle him warm, O Earth ! he is so cold. 
Now in his nostrils every scent has died. 

Still — still — upon his breast the white hands fold. 
And two red bleeding holes gape in his side. 



49 



**LE MAL" 

(Arthur Rimbaud) 

BLOOD-RED the shrapnel spits, and leaping higher 
Whistles day-long acroes the blue serene : 
Hounded before their King — scarlet and green, 
The massed battalions rrumbje under fire. 

And the old ghastly madness fills the grave — 
A hundred thousand men, one smoking heap. . . . 
O pitiful dead ! On the green fields you sleep, 

Earth's loveliness, thai bore you once so brave. 

And God, who laughs amid the cloth of gold 
And gleaming chalices, where incense steals. 

Hearing in sleep low anthems softly rolled. 

Wakes when a mother, huddled in her grief 
Under her old black bonnet weeps, and kneels, 

Offering her mite wrapped in a handkerchief.

LILIAN L. SPENCER 
{ST. HUGH'S) 



LA GOURTISANE 

I TIP-TOED past your window as you slept, 
A young pale moonbeam lighted on your bed, 
A ray of silver on your shadowed head. 
I think it was my heart's blood that I wept. 

Veiled, dreaming eyes, dark lashes, curved and long, 
Lithe, supple limbs, the languor of the South, 
Faint, haunting shadows lurking round your mouth, 

Red lips, which Love had made for wine and song. 

And then, because I loved you passing well, 
I could not bear to think the hands of Death 
Should one day strangle that slow-rising breath. 
I took my knife from out its blood-stained sheath — ■ 

And so we passed, each to our separate hell.

THE IN-COMING TIDE 

SOMEWHERE are dim green silences, and peace, 
And cloud-fleets slowly marshalled o'er the blue. 
And trails of liquid bird-notes, clear and true. 
With whir of glancing wings that find release. 

Where dawn-flushed roses scattered fragrance shed 
On swaying hare-bells' sheltered woodland dream, 
And hush of twilight shrouds the darkening stream 

As Night draws near, with silver-sandalled tread. 

Oh ! ship of dreams, borne in on hastening tide. 
Whose restless waves are sunless now, and cold. 
My heart is dumb, and suddenly grown old 

With lonely longing for the men who died.

E brought you gold. 
He brought you lilies and cool marble. 
Fallen in wondrous shapes. 
All the music of life and summer laugh'd in him. 
I had but dreams. 

These he brought you, 
These and his lips and longing eyes. 
Yet you turned to me — 
I who am nothing and love you— and chose, saying 
" Give me your dreams." 

But I could not. 
How could I ? I stood there mutely. 
And with proud tears 
You turned, and kissed him, and left me. ... " Still," 
said I, 
" I have my dreams." 

O my misery. 
Numb, choking, shaken with dry sobbing! 
Here indeed is Death. . . . 
O eternal and beautiful cruelty, dreadfully have you 
undone me. 
You have taken mv dreams.

TO A LADY 

THE Rain is falling : stars seem half put out, 
And Gloom, grey-cloaked, creeps down the shuddering street, 
Where the black pools and gutters meet and shout 

And spit out mud beneath the pouring sleet. 
The stripped poor world cried out as winter's thongs 

Beat on her bare-back, lash and sickening sting — 
And I forgot the sound of summer songs. 

Lisp of spring leaves and laughing flowers of spring — 
Till lo ! I looked and saw within your eyes 
The quickened roses in the blowing lane 
And whitening crops that smiled at summer skies, 
And the blood poppy and the world's done pain. 

Ah no ! the winter's song is not despair, 
Solange, for on your lip is hope and in your hair.

(NEW COLL.) 



SONG OF THE ELM 

FIRS they brood on the mountain steps 
Up to the edge of the snow 
And squirrel and jay by the larches play 

In the spate-marked cleave below. 
Plane tree skirts the walks of the town 
And tamarisk skirts the sea, 
But a rolling elm on a rolling down 
Is the mark of my country. 

Oak went sailing forth to war 

At the feet of admirals good, 
Wicked and crook'd and gnarled and hook'd, 

Crouching in Wistman's wood. 
Ash of the rowan the good wife knows 
Keeps roving ghosts from her door : 
But wind's in the elm with the nesting crows 

Voiced like a wave on the shore. 

When the smoke has died from the stacks of hell. 

Where the damned do honest toil, 
When the Wafer is dust, and as all men must 

Its priest lies under the soil ; 
When the moon is black, and the sun is old, 
And drowned men swarm up the sea. 
And the Lord climbs down from his chair of gold. 

He'll climb by an old elm tree.

SUMMER NEAR TOWER BRIDGE 

SOME acrid (hildren of the town, 
Whose little bodies peep between 
Rents in their garments, cry obscene 
Hail to each other, patter down. 
Barefoot, the sun warmed paves, to see 
Those the more venturous who strip 
On some low barge behind a ship. 
And yellow Thames looks cool and free : 
They stand white-skinn'd, but thin of thigh, 
Crop-headed ; each one waits the other 
To take the splash and abrupt smother, 
Each boastful in his nudity. 
The first dives and the others scream. 
The others, one by one, and watch 
Some wallowing lighters in a batch. 
The tug foam-thrashing up the stream. 
Tower green grass is bright with sun, 
The speech of wheels is deep and wide, 
While some chime on Surrey side 
Tells how the city hours run. 



56 



EPIPHANY 

Ax hour of May for me 
Is true Epiphany, 
When the birds sing to us 
" Creator Spiritus," 
And in each little nest 
The Lord is manifest ; 
When thorn along the dou n 
Is white with holy crown, 
When plover scream and swerve. 
Who their master ser\c 
And all the brilliant wood 
Is breathing God, 
Now, no man may not see 
True Epiphany.

LEO WARD 
{CHRIST CHURCH) 



MEDITATION 

(From an Eastern Sage) 

MOVED out of many things, 
On wearied wings 
Of unavailing sense, 
I, seeking, found a way— 
A purpose to allay 

The failure of that sweet sufficience, 
That as a dreamy cloud 
Would still the winged voice 
Which, by no evil choice, 
Hath purpose to be loud. 

I sought a way of power : 

In every crowded hour 

I learn 'd! 

Nor ever spurn VI 

The land of ever-opening light. 

The star of knowledge in the realm of night. 

So, marvell'd I to know 

What was of long ago. 

And how my heart shall take, 

And how re-make 

The gleams that come and go. 

So, in my scholar gown 
{Alive now grown !) 

I wearied not of all-the-earth's fair crown 
That was my own. 
58 



Meditation 



I sought no more the feast : 

I, now, more than a beast, 

Cared little for the chase, the victory 

O'er other beasts that I 

No more could hate 

Nor care to emulate ! 

Yet, as on earthly wing 

I sought a higher thing, 

Was caught 

In the realms of thought. 

So, seeking, must I find 

(Or fail, for ever blind). 

That Light 

Amid the night : 

That Power that did inflame 

This universal frame ! . . . 

The gleams that come and go 

That Power do know— 

For I have caught 

A radiance of their thought ; 

And, as I left behind 

A body starved and blind. 

So will I starve the brain 

If but the soul attain 

To love 

Which is above : 

And in love's longing find 

The body, soul, and mind !

PETER WARREN 
(MAGDALEN) 



LOUGH GORRIB 

A STILLNESS is on the bog, 
The wide dim lake, 
And the castle on the hill, 
Where the sun goes setting down, 
Tingeing with amber-red 
The long bog-grass and purple heather. 
Far off an owl cries out. 
And a distant dog ; 
Man and his beast go home 
To the long white village beyond. 

Twilight comes 

And the restless spirit of the past 

Sighing over the lake. 

Sighing weary in the stillness of the du.sic, 

Sad as the soft warm air. 

The murmur of the grass, 

And the gentle scent of the hills. 

When the sun goes setting down. 

Sad torn spirit of this land, 

Sighing in the pale evening 

For the sorrow that has been. 

And the sorrow that is to come. 

The night draws in. 

The landscape fades. 

And a fresh strong wind blows over the lake.
