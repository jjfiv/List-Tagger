MOUNTAINEER'S PRAYER 

Gird me with the strength of Thy steadfast hills. 

The speed of Thy streams give me! 
In the spirit that calms, with the life that thrills, 

I would stand or run for Thee. 
Let me be Thy voice, or Thy silent power, 

As the cataract, or the peak, — 
An eternal thought, in my earthly hour. 

Of the living God to speak! 

Clothe me in the rose-tints of Thy skies. 

Upon morning summits laid ! 
Robe me in the purple and gold that flies 

Through Thy shuttles of light and shade! 
Let me rise and rejoice in Thy smile aright. 

As mountains and forests do! 
Let me welcome Thy twilight and Thy night. 

And wait for Thy dawn anew ! 

Give me the brook's faith, joyously sung 
Under clank of its icy chain! 
(3) 



MOUNTAINEER'S PRAYER 

Give me of the patience that hides among 

The hill-tops, in mist and rain! 
Lift me up from the clod, let me breathe Thy 
breath, 
Thy beauty and strength give me! 
Let me lose both the name and the meaning of 
death, 
In the life that I share with Thee! 

Lucy Larcom. 



NEW HAMPSHIRE 

God bless New Hampshire! from her granite 

peaks 
Once more the voice of Stark and Langdon speaks. 
The long-bound vassal of the exulting South 
i For very shame her self-forged chain has 

broken ; 
Torn the black seal of slavery from her mouth, 
t And in the clear tones of her old time spoken ! 
Oh, all undreamed-of, all unhoped-for changes! 

The tyrant's ally proves his sternest foe; 
To all his biddings, from her mountain ranges, 

New Hampshire thunders an indignant No! 
Who is it now despairs? Oh, faint of heart, 

Look upward to those Northern mountains cold. 

Flouted by Freedom's victor-flag unrolled. 
And gather strength to bear a manlier part! 

John Greenleaf Whittier.

EASTER IN THE WHITE HILLS 

Hark! where the cliffs are lost in clouds 
That float to the Realm of Souls, 
"The Lord is risen!" from peak to peak 
In rapturous echo rolls! 
Through Waumbek's templed land it rings 

From Winnipesaukee's side 
To far Coos, whose crystal lakes 
Dower Androscoggin's tide. 
And brim serene Connecticut 

Of mount and main the pride. 

Agiochook from his altars 

To spired Chocorua calls. 

And broad Moosilauke sends the cry- 
Back from his buttressed walls; 

Franconia answers full and clear 
With myriad airy voices, 

And a glory lights the great Stone-Face 
While all the pass rejoices; 

And south, the towering sentinels — 
Monadnock's lonely fane, 
(6) 



EASTER IN THE WHITE HILLS 

And domed Kearsarge, by Merrimack — 

Swell the celestial strain, 
Till the sky is filled with the choral notes 

Of the jubilant refrain! 



I 



And lo! the rush and roar of streams 

Freed from their icy prison! 
Saco to Pemigewasset 

Proclaims, "The Lord is risen!*' 
"Is risen!" sings Ammonoosuc, 

To the meadows foaming down; 
"Is risen!" the waking brooks reply, 

In the glens yet bare and brown. 
The sun comes over Katahdin 

With flame for every crest, — 
Flame and rose for the stainless snows 

That deep on the summits rest; 
And peak and cloud in the golden rays 

Shine fair as Tabor *s sheen. 
When heaven embosomed the lonely hill 

And God of man was seen. 



Through the sombre firs the west wind sighs 
And chants to larch and pine, 
( 7 ) 




EASTER IN THE WHITE HILLS 

"The Lord is risen!" till echoes steal 
To the forest's inmost shrine. 
And list! from the maple boughs a song 

The angel choir might heed, — 
A wild-wood robin warbling sweet, 

"The Lord is risen indeed!" 
And thus, with grandest symphonies, 

And song the soul that thrills, 
Comes Easter, golden, glorious, 
To Waumbek*s templed hills. 

Edna Dean Proctor,

ENTHRALLED 



Like huge waves, petrified, against the sky, 
The solemn hills are heaved ; by shadow kissed. 

Or softly touched by delicate light they lie 
Melting in sapphire and in amethyst. 

The thronging mountains, crowding all the scene, 
Are like the long swell of an angry sea, 

Tremendous surging tumult that has been 
Smitten to awful silence suddenly. 

The nearer slopes with autumn glory blaze. 
Garnet and ruby, topaz, amber, gold; 

Up through the quiet air the thin smoke strays 
From many a lonely homestead, brown and old. 

The scattered cattle graze in pastures bare, 
The brooks sing unconcerned beside the way. 

Belated crickets chirp, while still and fair 
Dies into sunset peace the golden day. 

And toward the valley, where the little town 
( 9 ) 



ENTHRALLED 

Beckons with twinkling lights, that gleam be- 
low 
Like bright and friendly eyes, we loiter down 
And find our shelter and our fireside glow. 

But while the gay hours pass with laugh and jest. 
And all is radiant warmth and joy once more. 

My captured thought must wander out in quest 
Of that vast mountain picture, o'er and o'er; 

Where underneath the black and star-sown arch 
Earth's ancient trouble speaks eternally; 

And I must watch those mighty outlines march 
In silence, motionless, with none to see; 

While from the north the night-wind sighing 
sweeps, 
And sharp against the crystal sky relieved. 
The tumult of forgotten ages sleeps 

Where like huge waves the solemn hills are 
heaved. 

Celia Thaxter.

MOUNT WASHINGTON 

Across his breast the autumn sunbeams fall. 
While up his shaggy side the shadows creep 
From foot to crown, — a flock of mountain 
sheep 

Slow climbing homeward at the shepherd's call. 
Scaling with certain foot the jagged wall. 
Overleaping gulfs and canons wildly deep 
Within whose cells the storm-winged Furies 
sleep, — 
Until they gather at their starlit stall. 
And up the iron trail the genii go. 

With sturdy shoulders pushing venturous trains. 
While the grim mountain shakes his sides 
with glee 
To see his faithful vassals toiling so. 

At last the clouds engulf them, and it rains; 
So great ships vanish in a thunderous sea. 

Edward Augustus Jenks.

IN THE CRYSTAL HILLS 

From The Bridal of Penacook 

We had been wandering for many days 
Through the rough northern country. We had 

seen 
The sunset, with its bars of purple cloud, 
Like a new heaven, shine upward from the lake 
Of Winnepiseogee; and had felt 
The sunrise breezes, midst the leafy isles 
Which stoop their summer beauty to the lips 
Of the bright waters. We had checked our steeds, 
Silent with wonder, where the mountain wall 
Is piled to heaven; and, through the narrow rift 
Of the vast rocks, against whose rugged feet 
Beats the mad torrent with perpetual roar, 
Where noonday is as twilight, and the wind 
Comes burdened with the everlasting moan 
Of forests and of far-off waterfalls. 
We had looked upward where the summer sky, 
Tasselled with clouds light-woven by the sun, 
Sprung its blue arch above the abutting crags 
O'er-roofing the vast portal of the land 
( 12 ) 



IN THE CRYSTAL HILLS 

Beyond the wall of mountains. We had passed 
The high source of the Saco; and bewildered 
In the dwarf spruce-belts of the Crystal Hills, 
Had heard above us, like a voice in the cloud. 
The horn of Fabyan sounding; and atop 
Of old Agiochook had seen the mountains 
Piled to the northward, shagged with wood, and 

thick 
As meadow mole-hills, — the far sea of Casco, 
A white gleam on the horizon of the east; 
Fair lakes, embosomed in the woods and hills; 
Moosehillock's mountain range, and Kearsarge 
Lifting his granite forehead to the sun! 



And we had rested underneath the oaks 
Shadowing the bank, whose grassy spires are 

shaken 
By the perpetual beating of the falls 
Of the wild Ammonoosuc. We had tracked 
The winding Pemigewasset, overhung 
By beechen shadows, whitening down its rocks, 
Or lazily gliding through its intervals. 
From waving rye-fields sending up the gleam 
Of sunlit waters. We had seen the moon 
(13) 




IN THE CRYSTAL HILLS 

Rising behind Umbagog's eastern pines, 
Like a great Indian camp-fire; and its beams 
At midnight spanning with a bridge of silver 
The Merrimack by Uncanoonuc's falls. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



MOUNT WEBSTER 




FHOTO BY DETROIT PLBLIsHlNO CO. 



And the granite of New Hampshire 

Is made part of them till death. — Hovey 



MOUNT WEBSTER. 

A POWER unmoved, like him of iron will, — 
A mighty front of granite, it doth stand 
So firm, old time hath wrought it little ill. 
And here below, a cloud that fain would rest 
In some recess upon the mountain-side. 
Two bright cascades come leaping down its breast. 
Like rival swains in race before a bride, — 
Silver cascade, in wild and laughing leaps. 
Bursts forth in beauty o'er the granite gray; 
A hallowed light its winding pathway keeps 
While prism bloom bedecks its glittering spray! 
We feast our eyes from here, they are so plain. 
On Webster's breast they hang a silver chain.

FRANCONIA NOTCH 

The blackening hills close round: the beetling 

cliff 
On either hand towers to the upper sky. 
I pass the lonely inn; the yawning rift 
Grows narrower still, until the passer-by 
Beholds himself walled in by mountains high. 
Like everlasting barriers, which frown 
Around, above, in awful majesty: 
Still on, the expanding chasm deepens down. 
Into a vast abyss which circling mountains crown.

LAKE OF THE CLOUDS 

Queen of the clouds! afar from crowds 

Thou reignest all alone. 
In solitude which few intrude 

To bow at thy high throne. 

On either hand the mountains grand 

Their giant shoulders lift 
To bear thee up like God's sweet cup. 

Brimmed with his precious gift! 

Shrined *mid the haunts of alpine plants 
That wreathe thy rocky rim. 

Like clustered vines the graver twines 
About the beaker's brim. 

With what delight I caught the sight- 

Of thee I came to seek, 
At peace and rest beneath the crest 

Of Monroe's splintered peak; 

Where naught is heard of beast or bird 
Save the lone eagle's cry, 
( 17) 



LAKE OF THE CLOUDS 

Whose lordly flight eludes the sight. 
Lost in the deepening sky; 

And where no sound disturbs the round 

Of thy unruffled sleep, 
But bolts that flash and roar and crash 

And leap from steep to steep. 

O, what an hour to feel His power 
Who said, and it was done; 

And huge and vast these hills stood fast, 
Eternal as the sun! 

By thy low brink I knelt to drink 
Thy waters clear and cold, 

As the last ray that shuts the day 
Flushed thy fair face with gold. 

Below in light the valley bright 

In softened beauty shone. 
While o*er me rose in grand repose 

The dome of Washington. 

The soft green moss I stept across 
With wary feet and slow, 
(18) 



LAKE OP THE CLOUDS 

Crept in and out and all about 
The shattered rocks below; 

And wee bright flowers through sun and showers 

Peered out with sparkling eyes, 
As in the wild some unkempt child 

Looks up in shy surprise. 

O lovely lake, for thy sweet sake 

The powers of earth and air. 
That desolate all else, create 

For thee a garden fair. 

That 'mid the breath of gloom and death 

Seems let down from above 
To give us cheer where all is drear. 

Like God's abounding love. 

*Mid city heats I tread the streets 

And think of thee afar. 
As of one gone whose love beams on 

Like light from some lost star. 

O mighty mount, O crystal fount, 
O hills and lakes and streams, 
( 19)

How dear thou art to all my heart. 
How near in all my dreams!

THE WILLEY SLIDE 

From Thk Willey Housb 

Two summers now had seared the hills. 

Two years of little rain or dew; 
High up the courses of the rills 

The wild-rose and the raspberry grew; 

The mountain sides were cracked and dry. 
And frequent fissures on the plain, 

Like mouths, gaped open to the sky. 

As though the parched earth prayed for rain. 

One sultry August afternoon. 

Old Willey, looking toward the west. 

Said, "We shall hear the thunder soon: 
Oh! if it bring us rain, 't is blest." 

And even with his word, a smell 

Of sprinkled fields passed through the air. 
And from a single cloud there fell 

A few large drops — the rain was there. 

(22) 



THE WILLEY SLIDE 

Ere set of sun a thunder-stroke 
Gave signal to the floods to rise; 

Then the great seal of heaven was broke, 
Then burst the gates that barred the skies! 

While from the west the clouds rolled on, 
And from the nor*west gathered fast, 

"We'll have enough of rain anon,'* 
Said Willey, "if this deluge last." 

For all these cliffs that stand sublime 
Around, like solemn priests appeared. 

Gray Druids of the olden time, 

Each with his white and streaming beard. 

A sound ! as though a mighty gale 
Some forest from its hold had riven. 

Mixed with a rattling noise like hail! 
God! art Thou raining rocks from heaven? 

A flash! O Christ! the lightning showed 
The mountain moving from his seat ! 
(23) 



THE WILLEY SLIDE 

Out ! out into the slippery road ! 
Into the wet with naked feet ! 

For down the mountain's crumbling side. 
Full half the mountain from on high 

Came sinking, like the snows that slide 
From the great Alps about July. 

And with it went the lordly ash, 
And with it went the kingly pine; 

Cedar and oak, amid the crash. 

Dropped down like clippings of the vine. 

I.*:* • • • • • •

NEW HAMPSHIRE 



Thou art the rough nurse of a hero-brood, 
^P New Hampshire, and their mighty limbs by thee 
Were fashioned — they, the bards, the warriors 

trude. 
Whom Time hath dowered with fame imperish- 
ably. 
But not alone for this I love thee; I 

On thy bare mother-breast have laid my head^ 
And drunk the cool, deep silence, while the sky, 
IHp Confederate of my joy, laughed o*er my bed. 
Thus have I lain till half I seemed a part — 

In my clairvoyant mood — of Nature's plan; 
The very landscape crept into my heart. 

And they were one — the sense, the soul, of 
IK man; 

My kinship with life's myriad forms I knew : — ' 
Worms in the world of green, wings in the world 
of blue.

Nor less I loved thee in those hours of blight 

When winter fell upon thee like a sleep; 
Again I watch along the drifted white 

The dark triangle of the snow-plough sweep. 
Behold the oxen draw the creaking sled. 

Hear the sharp sleet rehearse upon the pane. 
See the wise village prophets shake the head 

While through the elms the witless winds com- 
plain. 
Ah, in those hours, O native hills ! I know 

Alert beneath thy guise of seeming dead 
The roots are warm, the saps of summer flow. 

The wings of immortality are bred! 
In all things reigns one immanent Control : 
The life beneath the snow, the Life within my 
soul!

Then hail, ye hills! like rough-hewn temples set. 

With granite beams, upon this earth of God! 
Austerer halls of worship never yet 

Had feet of Puritan or Pilgrim trod: 
Abrupt Chocorua, Greylock's hoary height, 

Katahdin, with her peak of bare, scarred stone. 
Sloping Monadnock, and, in loftier flight. 

Thou, rising to the eternal heavens, alone — 
The Sun-wooed sisters, less divinely proud. 

Bribed to compliance by their suitor's gold — 
Thou, wrapt in thy stern drapery of a cloud, 

Chaste, passionless, inviolably cold. 
Mount Washington! sky-shouldering, freedom- 
crowned. 
Compatriot with the windy blue above, around ! 
Frederic Lawrence Knowles. 



ON THE MOUNTAIN 

Not in the happy meadows, fair bedight 

With wreathed flowers, and set in golden ease. 
Where laugh bright waters under whispering 
trees, 
The soul of man puts on its purer sight. 
But far above, upon the stormy height. 

Set round with lightnings, torn by storm and 

breeze. 
Where the tired climber falls on trembling 
knees. 
His soul doth win the vision of delight! 

O blessing by Divinest Mercy sent 

To soothe the hurt of weariness and toil. 

Strike in our hearts great Patience' mighty 
chord ! 
That howsoe'er with strain of effort spent. 

Through sweat of brow and stain of earthly soil, 
We yet may rise to glory of the Lord !

MOUNT AGIOCHOOK 

Gray searcher of the upper air. 

There 's sunshine on thy ancient walls, 
A crown upon thy forehead bare, 

A flash upon thy waterfalls, 
A rainbow glory in the cloud 

Upon thine awful summit bowed. 
The radiant ghost of a dead storm! 

And music from the leafy shroud 
Which swathes in green thy giant form, 

Mellowed and softened from above 
Steals downward to the lowland ear, 

Sweet as the first, fond dream of love. 
That melts upon the maiden's ear. 



The wigw^am fires have all burned out. 
The moccasin has left no track; 

Nor wolf nor panther roam about 
The Saco and the Merrimack. 

And thou, that liftest up on high 

Thy mighty barriers to the sky, 
Art not the haunted mount of old. 

Where on each crag of blasted stone 
(29) 



MOUNT AGIOCHOOK 

Some dreadful spirit found his throne. 
And hid within the thick cloud fold. 
Heard only in the thunder's crash. 
Seen only in the lightning's flash, 
When crumbled rock and riven branch 
Went down before the avalanche!

GARFIELD'S BURIAL-DAY 

The great New England mountains, the tallest of 

their clan, 
Stood purple-robed around us; the presence of a 

man — 
The man we mourned — loomed vaster than any 

loftiest peak 
Uprising from the lowlands unclouded light to 

seek. 

Yet see, where far above us, a life escaped its 
shroud. 

Yon pale, scarred summit rises out of a sunset- 
cloud 

Woven of snow and crimson! and proudly, lightly 
now 

The new moon hangs her crescent on that trans- 
figured brow! 

Our martyr, crowned with honor, we saw uplifted 

stand. 
His monument his manhood, the glory of the 
land. 

(31 ) 



GARFIELD'S BURIAL-DAY 

Are not great men as mountains, that in them- 
selves aspire 

From their own baser levels toward heaven's bap- 
tismal fire? 

"Men should be more than mountains in gran- 
deur — and they are ! '* 

We said, as gazing downward around us, near and 
far. 

We saw a world of summits touched with that 
sunset flame. 

And greeted, high among them, the peak that 
bears his name. 

We cried, "Look up, dear country! ah, lift thee, 

widowed brow! 
As he has borne the earthly, he wears the heavenly 

now! 
The cruel blow that pierced him has raised him to 

the sky; 
Behold the starry manhood that lives, and cannot 

die!"

THE WHITE HILLS 



Thy varied scenes blend grace, my native land, 
With grandeur; here the tranquil lake, 
I^P And there the roaring torrent, — streams that 
break. 
Impetuous rushing, from thy mountain strand, 
With headlong force that scoops the yielding sand 
l^k And wears down granite. Lo! where towering 
high, 
His shoulders mantled with yon swelling cloud. 
Whence lightnings flash, and thunders roar aloud. 

Mount Washington ascends his native sky! 
Armed with the avalanche, he sweeps afar 

Man and his works, — his caverns stored with 
snow. 
Coeval with the rock. Like some lone star 
Above the storm he looks on earth below. 
Serene in silence, from his throne on high.

AT THE FLUME HOUSE 

White clouds a-sail in the shining blue, 

With shadows dropt to dredge the lands, 

A mountain wind and a marching storm. 

And a sound in the trees like waves on the sands; 

A mist to soften the shaggy side 

Of the great green hills, till they lie as dim 

As the hills in a childhood memory. 

The back of an upland pasture steep. 

With delicate fern-beds notching wide 

The dark wood line, where the birches keep 

Candlemas all the summer-tide; 

The crags and the ledges, silver-chased. 

Where yesterday's rainy runlets raced; 

And watching his valley, the Profile grim. 

And a golden sunset watching him. 

William Channing Gannett.

LOST RIVER 




The rivers of God are full of water 

Whittier 




LOOKING DOWN 



Dear World, on the peak we miss something, — 
I the sweet multitudinous sound 

Of leaves in the forest a-flutter, of rivulets lisping 

around; 
The smell of wild pastures in blossom, of fresh 
p earth upturned by the plough; — 

But the fields and woods led us hither; half-way 

they are following now. 



I 



One world — there is no separation — the same 
earth above and below; 
p here is the river's cloud-cradle, down there is 
its fulness and flow. 
My voice joins the voice of your millions who up- 
ward in weariness grope, 
nd the hills bear the burden to heaven, — human- 
ity's anguish and hope!

THE ASCENT OF MOUNT LAFAY- 
ETTE 

The mountains loose their locks from misty brows. 
And comb them by the lambent bars of gold 
Escaping through successive slants of boughs'. 
Swarth tresses are breeze-wafted from the face 
Of one unrivalled, with the wondrous eyes — 
Those searching eyes deep in his granite face. 
Those eyes unmelting yet mid sun and storm 
Of centuries, or triumphing in peace. 
Or steadfast above strife and tribal wars.* 

The cool recesses 'neath these clasping trees 
Have sheltered many a redman. Shielding rocks 
Have trembled to the feet of lordly beast, 
Ere yet the mightier tread of slow-paced Time 
Left imprint in the lessons of the ledge. 
In 'sweet uncertainty we climb the steeps, 
Our pathway unimpressed by frequent feet, 
Tingeing the way with romance of a doubt 
If we attain the half-illusive height. 
Nor did the seer so yearn for promised land 
As we for such a paradise withheld.

THE ASCENT OF MOUNT LAFAYETTE 

But soon the favoring breezes broke apart 
The long defile of living green, wherethrough 
Shimmers the sunlit affluence of plains. 
Rivers and fragmentary lakes and meads. 
" And every momentarj^ heaven succeeds 
In making earth less arduous, as we seek 
To gain its goal. 

The music of a fount 
Falls in resistless coolness o'er the way; 
Our hope renewed by draught miraculous. 
We wander on, each step one nearer heaven. 
Doth it not picture clear the path of life 
To world-worn pilgrims, and the blest reward? 
Surely if aught on earth foreshadow heaven. 
Behold it, while on every side, — the skies. 
The vales, the dusky way we trod are new. 
Re-glorified to our unbounded sight — 
Our sight — so long expectant — satisfied !

SUNSET ON MOUNT WASHINGTON 

The golden arrows cleave thy snowy crown, 
While thy dark vestments take a deeper brown. 
The twilight watchers watch each darkening zone, 
And bolder grown, usurp the sunlight's throne. 
Blow, west wind, blow ! ay, set the wild news flying: 
"The reign of day is o'er — its king is dying!'* 

The sun, a broken circle, half concealed, 
Sinks 'neath the glimmer of a golden field; 
A shining halo on the azure space 
Fast flees beyond the walls of light and place. 
Moan, east wind, moan ! ay, set the wild news fly- 
ing: 
"The reign of day is o'er — its king is dying!" 

A crumbling castle 'cross the shadowy lands 
Against the sky now silhouetted stands; 
A bar of bronze and silver at its door 
Now falls the wan day's purple threshold o'er. 
Sigh, south wind, sigh! ay, set the wild news fly- 
ing: 
"The reign of day is o'er — its king is dying!"

The dusky legions leap o*er castled wall. 

O'er ramparts frowning high, o'er sky, and all; 

The long light from thy hoary summit flees 

Like spirit hosts across the forest seas. 

Shriek, north wind, shriek! ay, set the wild news 

flying: 
"The king is dying!" Echo answers, "dying!'* 

The twilight hangs a curtain day and night 
Between. Afar and near the stars in might 
Begin their watch, while Venus sets on high 
Her home-light in the window of the sky. 
Swift winged winds abroad the news have 

spread : 
"The day is done — its king is dying — dead!" 
George Waldo Browne. 



THE PROFILE 

In thee the simple-minded Indian saw 
The image of his more benignant God, 
And viewed with deep and reverential awe 
The spot where the Great Spirit made abode; 
When storms obscured thee, and red lightnings 

glowed 
From the dark clouds oft gathered round thy 

face. 
He saw thy form in anger veiled, nor rowed 
His birchen bark, nor sought the wild deer chase 
Till thy dark frown had passed, and sunshine filled 

its place.

MOUNT LIBERTY 

O Liberty, that standest high. 
Lifting thy head into the sky. 
Majestic in thy symmetry, 
No type more perfect could there be. 

For, Liberty, thy sides are scarred, 
By reckless greed thy visage marred; 
In fury flames have o'er thee swept. 
While men have fought and angels wept. 

To reach thy noble height sublime 
Man slowly toils from time to time; 
The path is rough or steep or dim. 
The goal as yet concealed from him. 

But in those loftier realms of air 
The summit shines divinely fair, 
A rock unchanged through ages long. 
Resisting nature's forces strong.

MOUNT LIBERTY 

Free here is movement, free the sight. 
The air is free, and free the light; 
Free thoughts ascend to God above: 
Liberty's atmosphere is love. 

Karl Pomeroy Harrington. 



NOOK NEAR LAFAYETTE 

So clear, it seems but air just tinged with green, 
This lovely pool that rims the mountain's bowl; 
So still that Echo, haunting this fair scene, 
^May catch the music of some passing soul !

THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN 

All round the lake the wet woods shake 

From drooping boughs their showers of pearl; 
From floating skiff to towering cliff 

The rising vapors part and curl. 
The west wind stirs among the firs 

High up the mountain side emerging; 
The light illumes a thousand plumes 

Through billowy banners round them surging. 

A glory smites the craggy heights; 

And in a halo of the haze, 
Flushed with faint gold, far up, behold 

That mighty face, that stony gaze! 
In the wild sky upborne so high 

Above us perishable creatures. 
Confronting Time with those sublime, 

Impassive, adamantine features. 

Thou beaked and bald high front, miscalled 

The profile of a human face ! 
No kin art thou, O Titan brow, 

To puny man's ephemeral race. 
( 46 ) 



THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN 

The groaning earth to thee gave birth. 
Throes and convulsions of the planet; 

Lonely uprose, in grand repose. 
Those eighty feet of facial granite. 

Here long, while vast, slow ages passed, 

Thine eyes (if eyes be thine) beheld 
But solitudes of crags and woods, 

Where eagles screamed and panthers yelled. 
Before the fires of our pale sires 

In the first log-built cabin twinkled. 
Or red men came for fish and game, 

That scalp was scarred, that face was wrinkled. 

We may not know how long ago 

That ancient countenance was young; 
Thy sovereign brow was seamed as now 

When Moses wrote and Homer sung. 
Empires and states it antedates. 

And wars, and arts, and crime, and glory; 
In that dim morn when Christ was born 

Thy head with centuries was hoary. 

Thou lonely one! nor frost, nor sun, 
Nor tempest leaves on thee its trace; 
(47) 



THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN 

The stormy years are but as tears 
That pass from thy unchanging face. 

With unconcern as grand and stern, 

Those features viewed, which now survey us, 

A green world rise from seas of ice. 
And order come from mud and chaos. 

Canst thou not tell what then befell? 

What forces moved, or fast or slow; 
How grew the hills ; what heats, what chills, 

What strange, dim life, so long ago? 
High-visaged peak, wilt thou not speak? 

One word, for all our learned wrangle! 
What earthquakes shaped, what glaciers scraped, 

That nose, and gave the chin its angle? 

Our pygmy thought to thee is naught, 

Our petty questionings are vain; 
In its great trance thy countenance 

Knows not compassion nor disdain. 
With far-off hum we go and come. 

The gay, the grave, the busy-idle; 
And all things done to thee are one. 

Alike the burial and the bridal. 
( 48)

The little worth of words or fame ! 

1 go my way, but thou wilt stay 
While future millions pass the same: 

But what is this I seem to miss? 

Those features fall into confusion! 
A further pace — where was that face? 

The veriest fugitive illusion ! 

Gray eidolon! so quickly gone, 

When eyes, that make thee, onward move; 
Whose vast pretence of permanence 

A little progress can disprove! 
Like some huge wraith of human faith 

That to the mind takes form and measure; 
Grim monolith of creed or myth. 

Outlined against the eternal azure! 

O Titan, how dislimned art thou! 
A withered cliff is all we see;

THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN 



That giant nose, that grand repose, 

Have in a moment ceased to be; 
Or still depend on lines that blend. 

On merging shapes, and sight, and distance. 
And in the mind alone can find 

Imaginary brief existence ! 

John Townsend Trowbridge. 



PEABODY GLEN 

My way in opening dawn I took. 
Between the hills, beside a brook, 
The peaks one sun was climbing o'er, — 
The dew-drops showed ten millions more. 

The mountain valley is a vase 

Which God has brimmed with rarest grace, 

And, kneeling in the taintless air, 

I drink celestial blessings there. 

William Rounseville Algeb. 



(52) 



IN A CLOUD RIFT 

Upon our loftiest White Mountain peak. 

Filled with the freshness of untainted air, 
We sat, nor cared to listen or to speak 

To one another, for the silence there 
W^as eloquent with God's presence. Not a sound 

Uttered the winds in their unhindered sweep 
Above us through the heavens. The gulf pro- 
found. 

Below us, seethed with mists, a sullen deep: 
From thawless ice-caves of a vast ravine 
Rolled sheeted clouds across the lands unseen. 



How far away seemed all that we had known 

In homely levels of the earth beneath. 
Where still our thoughts went wandering! "Turn 

IH thee!" Blown 

^ Apart before us, a dissolving wreath 

Of clouds framed in a picture on the air: 
IB The fair long Saco valley, whence we came; 
The hills and lakes of Ossipee; — and there 

L Glimmers the sea! Some pleasant, well-known 
name 



IN A CLOUD RIFT 

With every break to memory hastens back; — 
Monadnock, Winnipesaukee, Merrimack. 

On widening vistas broader rifts unfold; 

Far off into the waters of Champlain 
Great sunset-summits dip their flaming gold; 

There winds the dim Connecticut, a vein 
Of silver through aerial green; and here 

The upland street of rural Bethlehem; 
And there the roofs of Bethel. Azure-clear 

Shimmers the Androscoggin; like a gem 
Umbagog glistens; and Katahdin gleams; — 
Or is it some dim mountain of our dreams? 

Our own familiar world, not yet half known, 

Nor loved enough, in tints of Paradise 
Lies there before us, now so lovely grown 

We wonder what strange film was on our eyes 
Ere we climbed hither. But again the cloud. 

Descending, shuts the beauteous vision out; 
Between us the abysses spread their shroud; 

We are to earth, as earth to us, a doubt; 
Dear home-folk, skyward seeking us, can see 
No crest or crag where pilgrim feet may be. 
(54 ) 



IN A CLOUD RIFT 



Who whispered unto us of life and death, 

As silence closed upon our hearts once more? 
On heights where angels sit, p)erhaps a breath 

May clear the separating gulfs; a door 
May open sometimes betwixt earth and heaven. 

And life's most haunting mystery be shown 
A fog-drift of the mind, scattered and driven 

Before the winds of God; no vague unknown 
Death's dreaded path, — only a curtained stair; 
And heaven but earth raised into purer air. 

Lucy Larcom. 



THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN 

Son of the tempest and the earthquake's jars, 
From out the womb of Chaos wast thou born. 
When the first sunrise from the gates of morn 
Stepped forth celestial and drew back the bars 
Of darkness, and the timorous little stars 
Shrank back with Night their mother. Thou hast 

worn 
Millenniums as jewels, and the scars 
Gray Time has scratched upon thee but adorn 
That pregnant brow with more than kingly grace. 
Man's life-tide ebbs and iflows as flows the sea: 
But thy stout soul, as from thy heavenward place 
Thou lookest out upon eternity, 
Of passion or of care betrays no trace. 
Crowned with a radiant immortality. 

Charles Fletcher Lummis.

KEEP THE FORESTS! 



O LONE Waumbek Methna! Who dares to pro- 
l^b fane 

Thy sohtudes, sacred to Manitou's reign? 
Thy peaks rosy-flushed with the last beam of day, 
Or lost in the stars, white and stainless as they?- 
Thy woods in whose dimness the bright streams 

are born. 
And the loud winds are lulled till the breaking of 

mom? — 
The sagamore turned from thy borders in dread. 
Afraid the high trails of the hill-gods to tread, 
Lest in flood, or in flame leaping vengeful, their ire 
Made the black pool his grave, the bleak summit 

his pyre. 
He saw their weird forms as the clouds floated past ; 
He heard their dark words in the wail of the blast ; 
Their arrows the lightnings, their drumbeats the 

thunder 
That rolled till the mountains seemed rending 

asunder; 
And hunter and warrior stole valeward to shun 
Agiochook lifting his brow to the sun. 
( 57 ) 



KEEP THE FORESTS! 

What! Pemigewasset glide pale to his tryst 
With Winnipesaukee — his waning tide kissed 
No more by the shadows that droop and entwine 
Of the birch and the maple, the beech and the 

pine, 
The firs whose battalions so slender and tall 
Guard the gloom of the gorge and the flash of the 

fall? 
What! Merrimack's might left to languish and 

fail. 
While Penaeook's meadows their verdure bewail; 
While the mill-wheels are moveless, the flying 

looms still. 
For the proud stream no longer his channels can 

fill? — 
But, shorn of his forests, bereft of his springs. 
Forlorn as an eagle despoiled of its wings. 
Now grieving by rapids, now moaning by lea, 
Deserted, he creeps to the scorn of the sea! 
What! swift Ammonoosuc, the foam-wreath, the 

bride 
Of lordly Connecticut, faint at his side. 
While his lakes, wood-embosomed, and pure as his 

snows, 

( 58 ) 



KEEP THE FORESTS! 



I 



Are ravaged, and robbed of their sylvan repose? 
What ! Saco forsake his loved intervales, spent 
Ere the brooks of the lowlands their tributes have 

sent. 
While eastward and westward the gray ledges rise 
All treeless and springless confronting the skies, 
And Moosilauke, Pequawket, Chocorua, frown, 
As sad on the bare river- vales they look down? 

By the bounty and grandeur of river and steep, 
What the Red Man has hallowed the White Man 

must keep ! — 
Must pause with the hill-roving hunter, and ken 
The mighty ones guarding the cliff and the glen. 
No gold-seeking vandal shall ruthless invade 
The temple whose stones were to Manitou laid; 
Shall quench the clear springs and leave desert 

and bare 
The slopes and the valleys the gods have made 

fair! 
O peerless New Hampshire! awake from thy 

dreams ! 
Save the wealth of thy woodlands, the rush of thy 

streams, 

(59) 




KEEP THE FORESTS! 

The wild mountain splendor — the torrent, the 
pine — 

Thy groves and thy meadows, thy shade and thy 
shine ! 

For, part with the forest, the bright, brimming 
river, 

And thy strength and thy glory will vanish for- 
ever, 

And in wide desolation and ruin will fall 

Great Manitou's vengeance, thy soul to appall ! — 

Away with this folly, this madness, this shame! 

Be true to thy birthright, thy future, thy fame! 

And vow, by thy grandeurs of river and steep, 

What the Red Man has hallowed the White Man 
will keep! 

Edna Dean Proctor. 



THE SUMMIT-FLOWER 

Too close these giant hills their heads uprear; 

From peak to base the unswerving outlines 
sweep 
In awful curves; I follow them with fear: 

They bear me down to yon abysmal deep, 
Where storm-wind and black cloud for mastery 
fight, 

And toss me, as their plaything, on the air; 
The mountains crush me with their savage might ; 

Nature's rude strength is more than I can bear. 

little white flower on the summit born. 
How tenderly you look into my eyes ! 

Not for a moment do you feel forlorn 
Among these grandeurs and immensities. 

Vague, formless forces they; a life are you! 
My next of kin, and dear as near to me. 

You whisper in my ear a promise true, 
A faint, clear hint of immortality. 

1 touch your leaf with reverence, little flower! 

I think of spiritual heights beyond your ken, 
(61 ) 



THE SUMMIT-FLOWER 

Where mightier movements of invisible power 
Mould into God-like grace the lives of men. 
I gather courage, while I watch you here, 

Winning from elements fierce your happy 
breath, 
To root my hopes in mystery and fear, 

And find my life in that which seems my death. 

Lucy Larcom. 



SUNSET ON PROFILE LAKE 



I 

B The westward sun has left a wake of flame 

Wk Across the silent lake, upon whose breast 

H The stern, still Face, by wrathful tempests scarred, 

B Looks down impassive from the cliffs that frame 

H The crystal waters as they lie at rest, 

B Secure and trustful in his sleepless guard. 

B The regal trout, bestarred with gold and red, 
" Shoots headlong high above his native tide 

In pure excess of joy, to greet the sun 
; Ere yet he seeks his far Pacific bed; 

And from the copses on the mountain-side 
The rabbit leaps, a living streak of dun. 

Up)on the Old Man's brow one lingering ray 
Still clings caressingly, as if God's hand 

In radiant benediction rested there; 

And on the breezes' eddying currents. Day 

Drifts out beyond the dim horizon strand, 
And Night swims softly down the purple air. 

Charles Fletcher Lummi^.

IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS 

Mountains in whose vast shadows live great 

names, 
On whose firm pillars rest mysterious dawns, 
And sunsets that redream the apocalypse; 
A world of billowing green that, veil on veil, 
Turns a blue mist and melts in lucent skies; 
A silent world, save for slow waves of wind, 
Or sudden, hollow clamor of huge rocks 
Beaten by valleyed waters manifold; — 
Airs that to breathe is life and joyousness; 
Days dying into music; nights whose stars 
Shine near, and large, and lustrous; these, O 

these, 
These are for memory to life's ending hour.

THE HILLS ARE HOME 

Forget New Hampshire? By her cliflFs, her 

meads, her brooks afoam, 
With love and pride where'er we bide, the Hills, 

the Hills are Home ! 
On Mississippi or by Nile, Ohio, Volga, Rhine, 
We see our cloud-born Merrimack adown its 

valley shine; 
And Contoocook, Singing Water, Monadnock's 

drifts have fed, 
With lilt and rhyme and fall and chime flash o'er 

its pebbly bed; 
And by Como's wave, yet fairer still, our Winni- 

pesaukee spread. 

Alp nor Sierra, nor the chains of India or Peru, 

Can dwarf for us the white-robed heights our won- 
dering childhood knew — 

The awful Notch, and the great Stone-Face, and 
the Lake where the echoes fly. 

And the sovereign dome of Washington throned 
in the eastern sky; — 
( 65 ) 



THE HILLS ARE HOME 

For from Colorado's Snowy Range to the crest of 

the Pyrenees 
New Hampshire's mountains grandest lift their 

peaks in the airy seas. 
And the winds of half the world are theirs across 

the main and the leas. 

Yet far beyond her hills and streams New Hamp- 
shire dear we hold: 
A thousand tender memories our glowing hearts 

enfold; 
For in dreams we see the early home by the elms 

or the maples tall, 
The orchard-trees where the robins built, and the 

well by the garden wall; 
The lilacs and the apple-blooms make paradise of 

May, 
And up from the clover-meadows floats the 

breath of the new-mown hay; 
And the Sabbath bells, as the light breeze swells, 

ring clear and die away. 

And oh, the Lost Ones live again in love's im- 
mortal year! 

(66) 



THE HILLS ARE HOME 

We are children still by the hearth-fire's blaze 
while night steals cold and drear ; 

Our mother's fond caress we win, our father's 
smile of pride. 

And, "Now I lay me down to sleep," say, rever- 
ent, at their side. 

Alas! alas! their graves are green, or white with a 
pall of snow. 

But we see them yet by the evening hearth as in 
the long ago. 

And the quiet churchyard where they rest is the 
holiest spot we know. 

Forget New Hampshire? Let Kearsarge forget 

to greet the sun; 
Connecticut forsake the sea; the Shoals their 

breakers shun; 
But fervently, while life shall last, though wide 

our ways decline. 
Back to the Mountain-Land our hearts will turn 

as to a shrine ! 
Forget New Hampshire.'^ By her cliffs, her meads, 

her brooks afoam, 

(67) 




THE HILLS ARE HOME 

By all her hallowed memories, — our lode-star 

while we roam, — 
Whatever skies above us rise, the Hills, the Hills 

are Home! 

Edna Dean Proctor. 



ASLEEP ON THE SUMMIT 

Upon the mountain's stormy breast 
I laid me down and sank to rest; 
I felt the wild thrill of the blast. 
Defied and welcomed as it passed, 
And made my lullaby the psalm 
Of strife that wins immortal calm. 

Cradled and rocked by wind and cloud, 
Safe pillowed on the summit proud. 
Steadied by that encircling arm 
Which holds the universe fyom harm, 
I knew the Lord my soul would keep. 
Among His mountain-tops asleep.

AMONG THE HILLS 

PRELUDE 

Along the roadside, like the flowers of gold 
That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought. 
Heavy with sunshine droops the golden-rod. 
And the red pennons of the cardinal-flowers 
Hang motionless upon their upright staves. 
The sky is hot and hazy, and the wind. 
Wing-weary with its long flight from the south, 
Unfelt; yet, closely scanned, yon maple leaf 
With faintest motion, as one stirs in dreams. 
Confesses it. The locust by the wall 
Stabs the noon-silence with his sharp alarm. 
A single hay-cart down the dusty road 
Creaks slowly, with its driver fast asleep 
On the load's top. Against the neighboring hill. 
Huddled along the stone wall's shady side. 
The sheep show white, as if a snowdrift still 
Defied the dog-star. Through the open door 
A drowsy smell of flowers — gray heliotrope. 
And white sweet clover, and shy mignonette — 
Comes faintly in, and silent chorus lends 
To the pervading symphony of peace. 
(73 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

No time is this for hands long overworn 

To task their strength : and (unto Him be praise 

Who giveth quietness !) the stress and strain 

Of years that did the work of centuries 

Have ceased, and we can draw our breath once 

more 
Freely and full. So, as yon harvesters 
Make glad their nooning underneath the elms 
With tale and riddle and old snatch of song, 
I lay aside grave themes, and idly turn 
The leaves of memory's sketch-book, dreaming 

o'er 
Old summer pictures of the quiet hills. 
And human life, as quiet, at their feet. 

And yet not idly all. A farmer's son. 
Proud of field-lore and harvest craft, and feeling 
All their fine possibilities, how rich 
And restful even poverty and toil 
Become when beauty, harmony, and love 
Sit at their humble hearth as angels sat 
At evening in the patriarch's tent, when man 
Makes labor noble, and his farmer's frock 
The symbol of a Christian chivalry 
( 74 ) 



■^' 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Tender and just and generous to her 
Who clothes with grace all duty; still, I know 
Too well the picture has another side, — 
How wearily the grind of toil goes on 
Where love is wanting, how the eye and ear 
And heart are starved amidst the plenitude 
Of nature, and how hard and colorless 
Is life without an atmosphere. I look 
_ cross the lapse of half a century. 
And call to mind old homesteads, where no flower 
Told that the spring had come, but evil weeds. 
Nightshade and rough-leaved burdock in the place 
Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose 
I And honeysuckle, where the house walls seemed 
' Blistering in sun, without a tree or vine 
To cast the tremulous shadow of its leaves 
Across the curtainless windows, from whose panes 
Fluttered the signal rags of shiftlessness. 
Within, the cluttered kitchen-floor, unwashed 
(Broom-clean I think they called it) ; the best 
IB room 

Stifling with cellar-damp, shut from the air 
In hot midsummer, bookless, pictureless 
Save the inevitable sampler hung 
(75 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Over the fireplace, or a mourning piece, 
A green-haired woman, peony-cheeked, beneath 
Impossible willows; the wide-throated hearth 
Bristling with faded pine-boughs half concealing 
The piled-up rubbish at the chimney's back; 
And, in sad keeping with all things about them. 
Shrill, querulous women, sour and sullen men, 
Untidy, loveless, old before their time. 
With scarce a human interest save their own 
Monotonous round of small economies. 
Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood; 
Blind to the beauty everywhere revealed. 
Treading the May-flowers with regardless feet; 
For them the song-sparrow and the bobolink 
Sang not, nor winds made music in the leaves; 
For them in vain October's holocaust 
Burned, gold and crimson, over all the hills, 
The sacramental mystery of the woods. 
Church-goers, fearful of the unseen Powers, 
But grumbling over pulpit-tax and pew-rent. 
Saving, as shrewd economists, their souls 
And winter p)ork with the least possible outlay 
Of salt and sanctity; in daily life 
Showing as little actual comprehension 
( 76) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Of Christian charity and love and duty. 
As if the Sermon on the Mount had been 
Outdated like a last year's almanac : 
Rich in broad woodlands and in half-tilled fields. 
And yet so pinched and bare and comfortless, 
The veriest straggler limping on his rounds. 
The sun and air his sole inheritance, 
Laughed at a poverty that paid its taxes, 
And hugged his rags in self-complacency ! 

Not such should be the homesteads of a land 
Where whoso wisely wills and acts may dwell 
As king and lawgiver, in broad-acred state. 
With beauty, art, taste, culture, books, to make 
His hour of leisure richer than a life 
Of fourscore to the barons of old time; 
Our yeoman should be equal to his home 
Set in the fair, green valleys, purple walled, 
A man to match his mountains, not to creep 
Dwarfed and abased below them. I would fain 
In this light way (of which I needs must own 
With the knife-grinder of whom Canning sings, 
"Story, God bless you! I have none to tell you!'*) 
Invite the eye to see and heart to feel 
(77 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

The beauty and the joy within their reach, — 
Home, and home loves, and the beatitudes 
Of nature free to all. Haply in years 
That wait to take the places of our own, 
Heard where some breezy balcony looks down 
On happy homes, or where the lake in the moon 
Sleeps dreaming of the mountains, fair as Ruth, 
In the old Hebrew pastoral, at the feet 
Of Boaz, even this simple lay of mine 
May ^eem the burden of a prophecy. 
Finding its late fulfilment in a change 
Slow as the oak's growth, lifting manhood up 
Through broader culture, finer manners, love, 
And reverence, to the level of the hills. 

O Golden Age, whose light is of the dawn. 

And not of sunset, forward, not behind. 

Flood the new heavens and earth, and with thee 

bring 
All the old virtues, whatsoever things 
Are pure and honest and of good report. 
But add thereto whatever bard has sung 
Or seer has told of when in trance or dream 
They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy! 
(78) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Let Justice hold her scale, and Truth divide 
Between the right and wrong; but give the heart 
The freedom of its fair inheritance; 
Let the poor prisoner, cramped and starved so 

long. 
At Nature's table feast his ear and eye 
With joy and wonder; let all harmonies 
Of sound, form, color, motion, wait upon 
The princely guest, whether in soft attire 
Of leisure clad, or the coarse frock of toil. 
And, lending life to the dead form of faith. 
Give human nature reverence for the sake 
Of One who bore it, making it divine 
With the inefiFable tenderness of God; 
Let common need, the brotherhood of prayer. 
The heirship of an unknown destiny. 
The unsolved mystery round about us, make 
A man more precious than the gold of Ophir. 
Sacred, inviolate, unto whom all things 
Should minister, as outward types and signs 
Of the eternal beauty which fulfils 
The one great purpose of creation. Love, 
The sole necessity of Earth and Heaven! 

( 79) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

For weeks the clouds had raked the hills 
And vexed the vales with raining, 

And all the woods were sad with mist. 
And all the brooks complaining. 

At last, a sudden night-storm tore 

The mountain veils asunder. 
And swept the valleys clean before 

The besom of the thunder. 

Through Sandwich notch the west-wind sang 

Good morrow to the cotter; 
And once again Chocorua's horn 

Of shadow pierced the water. 

Above his broad lake Ossipee, 
Once more the sunshine wearing. 

Stooped, tracing on that silver shield 
His grim armorial bearing. 

Clear drawn against the hard blue sky. 
The peaks had winter's keenness; 

And, close on autumn's frost, the vales 
Had more than June's fresh greenness. 
(80) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Again the sodden forest floors 

With golden lights were checkered. 

Once more rejoicing leaves in wind 
And sunshine danced and flickered. 

It was as if the summer's late 

Atoning for its sadness 
Had borrowed every season's charm 

To end its days in gladness. 

I call to mind those banded vales 

Of shadow and of shining. 
Through which, my hostess at my side, 

I drove in day's declining. 

We held our sideling way above 
The river's whitening shallows, 

By homesteads old, with wide-flung barns 
Swept through and through by swallows; 

By maple orchards, belts of pine 

And larches climbing darkly 
The mountain slopes, and, over all, 

The great peaks rising starkly. 
(81 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

You should have seen that long hill-range 
With gaps of brightness riven, — 

How through each pass and hollow streamed 
The purpling lights of heaven, — 

Rivers of gold-mist flowing down 

From far celestial fountains, — 
The great sun flaming through the rifts 

Beyond the wall of mountains ! 

We paused at last where home-bound cows 
Brought down the pasture's treasure, 

And in the barn the rhythmic flails 
Beat out a harvest measure. 

We heard the night-hawk's sullen plunge. 
The crow his tree-mates calling: 

The shadows lengthening down the slopes 
About our feet were falling. 

And through them smote the level sun 

In broken lines of splendor. 
Touched the gray rocks and made the green 

Of the shorn grass more tender. 
(82) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

The maples bending o*er the gate. 
Their arch of leaves just tinted 

With yellow warmth, the golden glow 
Of coming autumn hinted. 

Keen white between the farm-house showed. 

And smiled on porch and trellis. 
The fair democracy of flowers 

That equals cot and palace. 

And weaving garlands for her dog, 

*Twixt chidings and caresses, 
A human flower of childhood shook 

The sunshine from her tresses. 

On either hand we saw the signs 

Of fancy and of shrewdness, 
Where taste had wound its arms of vines 

Round thrift's uncomely rudeness. 

The sun-brown farmer in his frock 
Shook hands, and called to Mary : 

Bare-armed, as Juno might, she came, 
White-aproned from her dairy. 
( 83 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Her air, her smile, her motions, told 
Of womanly completeness; 

A music as of household songs 
Was in her voice of sweetness. 

Not fair alone in curve and Hne, 
But something more and better, 

The secret charm eluding art. 
Its spirit, not its letter; — 

An inborn grace that nothing lacked 
Of culture or appliance, — 

The warmth of genial courtesy. 
The calm of self-reliance. 

Before her queenly womanhood 
How dared our hostess utter 

The paltry errand of her need 
To buy her fresh-churned butter? 

She led the way with housewife pride. 
Her goodly store disclosing, 

Full tenderly the golden balls 
With practised hands disposing. 
(84) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

Then, while along the western hills 
We watched the changeful glory 

Of sunset, on our homeward way, 
I heard her simple story. 

The early crickets sang; the stream 
Plashed through my friend's narration: 

Her rustic patois of the hills 
Lost in my free translation. 

"More wise," she said, "than those who swarm 
Our hills in middle summer, 
She came, when June's first roses blow. 
To greet the eariy comer. 

"From school and ball and rout she came. 
The city's fair, pale daughter. 
To drink the wine of mountain air 
Beside the Bearcamp Water. 

" Her step grew firmer on the hills 
That watch our homesteads over; 
On cheek and lip, from summer fields. 
She caught the bloom of clover. 
(85 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

'*For health comes sparkling in the streams 
From cool Chocorua stealing: 
There's iron in our northern winds; 
Our pines are trees of healing. 

"She sat beneath the broad-armed elms 
That skirt the mowing meadow, 
And watched the gentle west-wind weave 
The grass with shine and shadow. 

** Beside her, from the summer heat 
To share her grateful screening. 
With forehead bared, the farmer stood. 
Upon his pitchfork leaning. 

"Framed in its damp, dark locks, his face 
Had nothing mean or common, — 
Strong, manly, true, the tenderness 
And pride beloved of woman. 

"She looked up, glowing with the health 
The country air had brought her. 
And, laughing, said : * You lack a wife. 
Your mother lacks a daughter. 
( 86 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

'*To mend your frock, and bake your bread 
You do not need a lady : 
Be sure among these brown old homes 
Is some one waiting ready, — 

"Some fair, sweet girl with skilful hand 
And cheerful heart for treasure, 
Who never played with ivory keys. 
Or danced the polka's measure.' 

"He bent his black brows to a frown. 
He set his white teeth tightly. 

**T is well,* he said, *for one like you 
To choose for me so lightly. 

*You think because my life is rude 

I take no note of sweetness: 
I tell you love has naught to do 
With meetness or unmeet ness. 

" * Itself its best excuse, it asks 
No leave of pride or fashion 
When silken zone or homespun frock 
It stirs with throbs of passion. 
( 87 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"* You think me deaf and blind: you bring 
Your winning graces hither 
As free as if from cradle-time 
We two had played together. 

"* You tempt me with your laughing eyes. 
Your cheek of sundown's blushes, 
A motion as of waving grain, 
A music as of thrushes. 

"* The plaything of your summer sport. 
The spells you weave around me 
You cannot at your will undo. 
Nor leave me as you found me. 

*** You go as lightly as you came, 
Your life is well without me; 
What care you that these hills will close 
Like prison-walls about me? 

*** No mood is mine to seek a wife. 
Or daughter for my mother: 
Who loves you loses in that love 
All power to love another! 
{ 88) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

*I dare your pity or your scorn, 
With pride your own exceeding; 

I fling my heart into your lap 
Without a word of pleading.* 

* She looked up in his face of pain 

So archly, yet so tender: 
*And if I lend you mine,* she said, 
* Will you forgive the lender? 

*Nor frock nor tan can hide the man; 

And see you not, my farmer. 
How weak and fond a woman waits 

Behind the silken armor? 

*I love you: on that love alone. 
And not my worth, presuming. 

Will you not trust for summer fruit 
The tree in May-day blooming?* 

* Alone the hangbird overhead. 

His hair-swung cradle straining. 
Looked down to see love*s miracle, — 
The giving that is gaining. 
(89) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"And so the farmer found a wife. 
His mother found a daughter: 
There looks no happier home than hers 
On pleasant Bearcamp Water. 

"Flowers spring to blossom where she walks 
The careful ways of duty; 
Our hard, stiff Hues of life with her 
Are flowing curves of beauty. 

"Our homes are cheerier for her sake. 
Our door-yards brighter blooming, 
And all about the social air 
Is sweeter for her coming. 

"Unspoken homilies of peace 
Her daily life is preaching; 
The still refreshment of the dew 
Is her unconscious teaching. 

"And never tenderer hand than hers 
Unknits the brow of ailing; 
Her garments to the sick man's ear 
Have music in their trailing. 
(90) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

'And when, in pleasant harvest moons. 
The youthful huskers gather, 

Or sleigh-drives on the mountain ways 
Defy the winter weather, — 

'In sugar-camps, when south and warm 
The winds of March are blowing, 

And sweetly from its thawing veins 
The maple*s blood is flowing, — 

'In summer, where some lilied pond 

Its virgin zone is bearing, 
Or where the ruddy autumn fire 

Lights up the apple-paring, — 

'The coarseness of a ruder time 

Her finer mirth displaces, 
A subtler sense of pleasure fills 

Each rustic sport she graces. 

'Her presence lends its warmth and health 

To all who come before it. 
If woman lost us Eden, such 

As she alone restore it. 
(91 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"For larger life and wiser aims 
The farmer is her debtor; 
Who holds to his another's heart 
Must needs be worse or better. 

"Through her his civic service shows 
A purer- toned ambition; 
No double consciousness divides 
The man and politician. 

"In party's doubtful ways he trusts 
Her instincts to determine; 
At the loud polls, the thought of her 
Recalls Christ's Mountain Sermon. 

"He owns her logic of the heart. 
And wisdom of unreason, 
Supplying, while he doubts and weighs, 
The needed word in season. 

"He sees with pride her richer thought, 
Her fancy's freer ranges; 
And love thus deepened to respect 
Is proof against all changes. 
( 92 ) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"And if she walks at ease in ways 
His feet are slow to travel, 
And if she reads with cultured eyes 
What his may scarce unravel, 

"Still clearer, for her keener sight 
Of beauty and of wonder. 
He learns the meaning of the hills 
He dwelt from childhood under. 

"And higher, warmed with summer lights. 
Or winter-crowned and hoary. 
The ridged horizon lifts for him 
Its inner veils of glory. 

"He has his own free, bookless lore. 
The lessons nature taught him. 
The wisdom which the woods and hills 
And toiling men have brought him: 

"The steady force of will whereby 
Her flexile grace seems sweeter; 
The sturdy counterjwise which makes 
Her woman's life completer: 
(93) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"A latent fire of soul which lacks 
No breath of love to fan it; 
And wit, that, like his native brooks, 
Plays over solid granite. 

"How dwarfed against his manliness 
She sees the poor pretension, 
The wants, the aims, the follies, born 
Of fashion and convention ! 

"How life behind its accidents 

Stands strong and self-sustaining, 
The human fact transcending all 
The losing and the gaining. 

**And so in grateful interchange 

Of teacher and of hearer, 
Their lives their true distinctness keep 
While daily drawing nearer. 

"And if the husband or the wife 
In home's strong light discovers 
Such slight defaults as failed to meet 
The blinded eyes of lovers, 
(94) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

"Why need we care to ask? — who dreams 
Without their thorns of roses. 
Or wonders that the truest steel 
The readiest spark discloses? 

"For still in mutual sufferance lies 
The secret of true living; 
Love scarce is love that never knows 
The sweetness of forgiving. 

"We send the Squire to General Court, 
He takes his young wife thither; 
No prouder man election day 
Rides through the sweet June weather. 

"He sees with eyes of manly trust 
All hearts to her inclining; 
Not less for him his household light 
That others share its shining." 

Thus, while my hostess spake, there grew 

Before me, warmer tinted 
And outlined with a tenderer grace. 

The picture that she hinted. 
(95) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

The sunset smouldered as we drove 
Beneath the deep hill-shadows. 

Below us wreaths of white fog walked 
Like ghosts the haunted meadows. 

Sounding the summer night, the stars 
Dropped down their golden plummets; 

The pale arc of the Northern lights 
Rose o'er the mountain summits, 

Until, at last, beneath its bridge. 
We heard the Bearcamp flowing. 

And saw across the mapled lawn 
The welcome home-lights glowing. 

And, musing on the tale I heard, 
'T were well, thought I, if often 

To rugged farm-life came the gift 
To harmonize and soften; 

If more and more we found the troth 

Of fact and fancy plighted, 
And culture's charm and labor's strength 

In rural homes united, — 
(96) 



AMONG THE HILLS 

The simple life, the homely hearth, 
With beauty's sphere surrounding. 

And blessing toil where toil abounds 
With graces more abounding. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



WHITEFACE 

Alpine in height, a towering form it lies 
Against the blue, colossal in the morn; 
And haply now the foamy clouds, o'erborne. 
Shall veil its summit on the eastern skies; 
And now the gentler airs shall whisper sighs, 
Or the imperious tempest-storm, forlorn, 
Whirl o*er the grim ravines and rock-ribs, shorn; 
Yet, lo! it stands immutable, defies 
The passion-throes of earth ! 

Symbol of power. 
It breasts the heavens; and when the shadows 
fall, 
When vales are blurred in dusk, watching, I 
see 
A nimbus clinging, like a golden shower. 

On its white brow. Even so, when truth shall 
pall 
On lesser souls, the great seem rapt and free! 
Stephen Henry Thayer. 



(98) 



CHOCORUA 

Again with August fires thou beckonest me, 
Chocorua, and at thy feet divine 
Where even gods might kneel as at a shrine. 

My soul is flooded with thy majesty. 

The sun has broken from the morning free. 
And with the golden dust of heaven ashine, 
The noonday vapors glittering round thee twine. 

And thou art wrapped in amber radiancy. 

And yet I saw thee once more tragic fair, 
When with the plaint of whippoorwills athrill 

The moon leaned over thee in white despair 
And spilled its silver agony, until 

Imperial thou stoodst with bosom bare 
And let its daggers stab thee at its will. 

Caroline Whiton-Stone.

VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

A SHALLOW stream, from fountains 
Deep in the Sandwich mountains. 

Ran lakeward Bearcamp River; 
And, between its flood-torn shores. 
Sped by sail or urged by oars. 

No keel had vexed it ever. 

Alone the dead trees yielding 
To the dull axe Time is wielding. 

The shy mink and the otter. 
And golden leaves and red, 
By countless autumns shed. 

Had floated down its water. 

From the gray rocks of Cape Ann, 
Came a skilled sea-faring man, 

With his dory, to the right place; 
Over hill and plain he brought her, 
Where the boatless Bearcamp water 

Comes winding down from Whiteface. 
( 100 ) 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

Quoth the skipper: "Ere she floats forth, 
I 'm sure my pretty boat's worth. 

At least, a name as pretty." 
On her painted side he wrote it. 
And the flag that o*er her floated 

Bore aloft the name of Jettie. 

On a radiant mom of summer. 
Elder guest and latest comer 

Saw her wed the Bearcamp water; 
Heard the name the skipper gave her. 
And the answer to the favor 

From the Bay State's graceful daughter. 

Then a singer, richly gifted. 
Her charmed voice uplifted; 

And the wood-thrush and song-sparrow 
Listened, dumb with envious pain. 
To the clear and sweet refrain 

Whose notes they could not borrow. 

Then the skipper plied his oar, 
And from off the shelving shore. 
Glided out the strange explorer; 
( 101 ) ^ 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

Floating on, she knew not whither, — 
The tawny sands beneath her. 
The great hills watching o*er her. 

On, where the stream flows quiet 
As the meadows' margins by it, 

Or widens out to borrow a 
New life from that wild water. 
The mountain giant's daughter. 

The pine-besung Chocorua. 

Or, mid the tangling cumber 
And pack of mountain lumber 

That spring floods downward force. 
Over sunken snag, and bar 
Where the grating shallows are, 

The good boat held her course. 

Under the pine-dark highlands. 
Around the vine-hung islands. 

She ploughed her crooked furrow; 
And her rippling and her lurches 
Scared the river eels and perches. 

And the musk-rat in his burrow. 
( 102 ) 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

Every sober clam below her, 
Every sage and grave pearl-grower. 

Shut his rusty valves the tighter; 
Crow called to crow complaining. 
And old tortoises sat craning 

Their leathern necks to sight her. 

So, to where the still lake glasses 
The misty mountain masses 

Rising dim and distant northward. 
And, with faint-drawn shadow pictures. 
Low shores, and dead pine spectres. 

Blends the skyward and the earthward. 

On she glided, overladen. 
With merry man and maiden 

Sending back their song and laughter, — 
While, perchance, a phantom crew. 
In a ghostly birch canoe. 

Paddled dumb and swiftly after! 

And the bear on Ossipee 
Climbed the topmost crag to see 
The strange thing drifting under; 
( 103 ) 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

And, through the haze of August, 
Passaconaway and Paugus 

Looked down in sleepy wonder. 

All the pines that d'er her hung 
In mimic sea-tones sung 

The song familiar to her; 
And the maples leaned to screen her. 
And the meadow-grass seemed greener. 

And the breeze more soft to woo her. 

The lone stream mystery-haunted, 
To her the freedom granted 

To scan its every feature. 
Till new and old were blended. 
And round them both extended 

The loving arms of Nature. 

Of these hills the little vessel 
Henceforth is part and parcel; 

And on Bearcamp shall her log 
Be kept, as if by Georges 
Or Grand Menan, the surges 

Tossed her skipper through the fog. 
( 104 ) 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

And I, who, half in sadness. 
Recall the morning gladness 

Of life, at evening time. 
By chance, onlooking idly, 
Apart from all so widely. 

Have set her voyage to rhyme. 

Dies now the gay persistence 
Of song and laugh, in distance; 

Alone with me remaining 
The stream, the quiet meadow. 
The hills in shine and shadow. 

The sombre pines complaining. 

And, musing here, I dream 
Of voyagers on a stream 

From whence is no returning, 
Under sealed orders going. 
Looking forward little knowing. 

Looking back with idle yearning. 

And I pray that every venture 
The port of peace may enter. 
That, safe from snag and fall 
( 105 ) 



VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE 

And siren-haunted islet, 
And rock, the Unseen Pilot 
May guide us one and all. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



CLOUDS ON WHITEFACE 

So lovingly the clouds caress his head — 

The mountain-monarch; he, severe and hard. 
With white face set like flint horizon- ward; 
They weaving softest fleece of gold and red. 
And gossamer of airiest silver thread, 

Towrap his form, wind-beaten, thunder-scarred. 
They linger tenderly, and fain would stay. 
Since he, earth-rooted, may not float away. 

He upward looks, but moves not; wears their 
hues; 
Draws them unto himself; their beauty shares; 
And sometimes his own semblance seems to lose, 
His grandeur and their grace so interfuse; 
And when his angels leave him unawares, 
A sullen rock, his brow to heaven he bares. 

Lucy Larcom.

MOUNT CHOCORUA 

Through the wide hush of heaven's soft sunlit 
blue, 

A universal prophet of the hills, 

You cry: "The world grows old!" High in the 
stills 
And calms of lofty solitude I view 
The glory of thy hoary head, and through 

The mellow misty shine that floods and fills 

The interspace, thy ancient grandeur thrills 
Adown the valleys, palpitant and new. 
O, patriarch of the hills ! Thy scattered locks 

Fall o'er thy shoulders broad and high up-piled; 
Thy brow is wrinkled, yet thy form of rocks 

Is full of aged beauty as when a child 
You frolicked with the ancient world that mocks 

You now grown gray, stern-faced, and wild. 

Edwin Osgood Grover.

ON OSSIPEE 

From White Evebiastino Flowkrs 

That morning on the mountain-top ! 
Could the day's chariot wheel but stop 
And leave us in this trance of light 
Upon our autumn-crimsoned height — 
Summit of lifted solitudes, 
Where but the hermit breeze intrudes; 
With one blue river glimpsed in sheen 
Along the valley's perfect green; 
With lakes, that open limpid eyes 
Unto the old heavens' new surprise; 
And over all, a purple range 
Of hills, that glow and pale, and change 
To pearl and turquoise, rose and snow. 
As cloud processions past them go, 
On unknown errands of the air. 

Lucy Larcom. 



( 109 ) 



THE SEEKING OF THE 
WATERFALL 

They left their home of summer ease 
Beneath the lowland's sheltering trees, 
To seek, by ways unknown to all. 
The promise of the waterfall. 

Some vague, faint rumor to the vale 
Had crept — perchance a hunter's tale — 
Of its wild mirth of waters lost 
On the dark woods through which it tossed. 

Somewhere it laughed and sang; somewhere 
Whirled in mad dance its misty hair; 
But who had raised its veil, or seen 
The rainbow skirts of that Undine? 

They sought it where the mountain brook 
Its swift way to the valley took; 
Along the rugged slope they clomb, 
Their guide a thread of sound and foam. 

Height after height they slowly won; 
The fiery javelins of the sun 

( no) 



THE SEEKING OF THE WATERFALL 

Smote the bare ledge; the tangled shade 
With rock and vine their steps delayed. 

But, through leaf-openings, now and then 
They saw the cheerful homes of men. 
And the great mountains with their wall 
Of misty purple girdling all. 

The leaves through which the glad winds blew 
Shared the wild dance the waters knew; 
And where the shadows deepest fell 
The wood-thrush rang his silver bell. 

Fringing the stream, at every turn 
Swung low the waving fronds of fern; 
From stony cleft and mossy sod 
Pale asters sprang, and golden-rod. 

And still the water sang the sweet. 
Glad song that stirred its gliding feet. 
And found in rock and root the keys 
Of its beguiling melodies. 

Beyond, above, its signals flew 
Of tossing foam the birch-trees through; 
( 111 ) 



THE SEEKING OF THE WATERFALL 

Now seen, now lost, but baffling still 
The weary seekers' slackening will. 

Each called to each: "Lo here! Lo there! 
Its white scarf flutters in the air!'* 
They climbed anew; the vision fled, 
To beckon higher overhead. 

So toiled they up the mountain-slope 
With faint and ever fainter hope; 
With faint and fainter voice the brook 
Still bade them listen, pause, and look. 

Meanwhile below the day was done; 
Above the tall peaks saw the sun 
Sink, beam-shorn, to its misty set 
Behind the hills of violet. 

"Here ends our quest!" the seekers cried, 
"The brook and rumor both have lied! 
The phantom of a waterfall 
Has led us at its beck and call." 

But one, with years grown wiser, said : 
"So, always baffled, not misled, 
( 112 ) 



THE SEEKING OF THE WATERFALL 

We follow where before us runs 
The vision of the shining ones. 

"Not where they seem their signals fly. 
Their voices while we listen die; 
We cannot keep, however fleet, 
The quick time of their winged feet. 

"From youth to age unresting stray 
These kindly mockers in our way; 
Yet lead they not, the baflSing elves. 
To something better than themselves? 

"Here, though unreached the goal we sought, 
Its own reward our toil has brought: 
The winding water's sounding rush, 
The long note of the hermit thrush, 

"The turquoise lakes, the glimpse of pond 
And river track, and, vast, beyond 
Broad meadows belted round with pines. 
The grand uplift of mountain lines ! 

"What matter though we seek with pain 
The garden of the gods in vain, 
( 113) 



THE SEEKING OF THE WATERFALL 

If lured thereby we climb to greet 
Some wayside blossom Eden-sweet? 

"To seek is better than to gain, 
The fond hope dies as we attain; 
Life's fairest things are those which seem, 
The best is that of which we dream." 



John Greenleaf Whittier. 



DEATH OF CHOCORUA 

On the cliff's extremest brow 
Fearless stands Chocorua now; 
Last of all his tribe, and he 
Doomed to death of cruelty. 
O'er the broad green vales that lie 
Far beneath, he casts his eye. 

"Lands where lived and died my sires. 
Where they built their council-fires; 
Where they roamed and knew no fear. 
Till the dread white-man drew near; 
Once when swelled the war-cry round. 
Flocked a thousand to the sound; 
But the white men came, and they 
Like the leaves have passed away. 

"Wo to them who seek to spoil 
The red owners of the soil! 
Wo to all who on this spot 
Fell the groves, or build the cot! 
Blighted be the grass that springs! 
Blighted be all living things! 
( 115 ) 



DEATH OF CHOCORUA 

And the pestilence extend, 

'Till Chocorua*s curse shall end!" 

On his murderers turned he then; 

Eyes shall ever haunt those men; 

Up to heaven a look he cast, 

And around — beneath — his last ! 

Far down and lone, his bones are strown. 

The sky his pall, his bed of stone. 

Charles James Fox. 



FRIEND BROOK 



Friend Brook, I hold thee dearest yet for what I 

do not know 
Of thy pure secret springs afar, the mystery of 
1^ thy flow 

Out of the mountain caverns, hid by tangled brier 

and fern; 
A friend is most a friend of whom the best remains 
^^P to learn. 

New-born each moment, flashing light through 

worn, accustomed ways. 
With gentle hindrance, gay surprise, sweet hurry- 

ings and delays; 
Spirit that issuest forth from wells of lifeunguessed, 

unseen, 
A revelation thou of all that holiest friendships 

mean! 

I will not name the hills that meet to hold thee 
hand in hand. 

The summits leaning toward thy voice, the moun- 
tain, lone and grand, 
( 117 ) 



FRIEND BROOK 

That looks across to welcome thee into the open 

light; 
Be hidden, O my brook, from all save love's anointed 

sight !

THE SPIRIT OF WORDSWORTH 



Spirit of Wordsworth, with me still 
Upon the plain, upon the hill, 
I find my purpose wholly bent 
To be to-day thine instrument; 
Led upward to the thought of thee 
By all the spreading world I see. 
The broad lake country at my feet 
Bids Asquam with Wynander greet, 
Rydal with Sunapee; and shows 
The Bearcamp water where it flows 
Another Rotha, stream and break. 
From covert pond to glittering lake; 
While Grasmere lies serene and still 
By yonder tarn beneath Red Hill. 
Thy mountains, Wordsworth, too, are by. 
And paint their shadows on the sky. 
Chocorua stands, but not alone. 
For out across the scene is thrown 
The memory of Helvellyn; hid 
Within thy folds, Tripyramid, 
Are thoughts of Kirkstone, Fairfield, all 
That heard Joanna's laughing call ! 
(119) 



THE SPIRIT OF WORDSWORTH 

Whiteface is vanished in the shade 

By Seawfell and Blencathra made; 

While Sandwich Mountain at the west, 

In Glaramara's shadow dressed, 

Leads the high path toward Campton ways 

Across a steeper Dunmail Raise!

A GLIMPSE OF CHOCORUA 




PUOIO BV MOOIir. BRISTOL 

But none shall more regretful leave 

These waters and these hills than I. — Whittier 



CHOCORUA LAKE 

Small is my house, my acres small, 

Yet where I look am lord of all; 

And far as where my feet may roam 

I ever find myself at home. 

I drink the drops that thrice distill 

From clouds the mountain tops unseal, 

Through moss, o'er stones and sand they steal 

Till forth they flow a taintless rill. 

And gold is here I might have won 

Had I the test of Lydian stone, 

Or magic wand in hand to twist 

Where silver hides below the schist. 

But there are mines of richer fee 

Which proud Chocoruan heights o'ersee; 

Full twenty lakes, though all are dear. 

Dearer Chocorua*s mountain mere. 

On this to float, with that to soar. 

Give these, and life can ask no more. 

John Albee.

A MOUNTAIN-RESURRECTION 

He stood there, a shape Titanic 
In the midst of the shining range; 

Moment by moment, his features 
Beamed with some wonderful change: 

For the clouds came down out of heaven; 

With light he was robed and crowned. 
Till glory exceeded glory 

On the gathering storm around. 

They melted to mists of silver. 
That slid like a winding-sheet. 

In swathings of shroud-like whiteness. 
From his forehead to his feet. 

And then he was seen no longer; 

With the sound of a sobbing rain. 
The hills withdrew under blackness, — 

A mourning funeral-train. 

And amid the vanished mountains 
We sat, through an autumn day, 
( 122 ) 



A MOUNTAIN-RESURRECTION 

Remembering the trusted spirits 

Who had passed from our sight away; 

And knew that their resurrection 

Would be but a veil let down 
To show them still in their places, 

Unchangeable, and our own; 

And knew that the living who love us. 
Love on, though the mists of doubt 

May level our grand horizon. 
And beauty and joy shut out. 

And knew — O comforting wonder! — 

That the mightiest Love of all. 
Perceived not, is round about us 

Like an everlasting wall. 

So, amid invisible summits. 

We wrapped us in calms of thought. 

Faith lulled us to slumber; and morning 
To life the dead mountains brought. 

Lucy Larcom.

THE LOG-COCK 

In the glens below Chocorua, 
In the forests north of Paugus, 
On the steeps of Passaconway, 
Where the yellow birch and hemlock. 
Scarred not by the blade of commerce. 
Spring from moss-clad beds of granite; 
Where the brown bear, law defying. 
And the red deer, law protected, 
Make their homes among the moose-wood. 
Sleep upon the sweet linnsea; 
Where in spring the leaping waters 
Rush in three ways towards the ocean, 
By the Saco, by the Bearcamp, 
By the mad Pemigewasset; 
Where in winter, moaning tempests 
Rack the forests, whirl the snowflakes. 
Dwells in grim and lonely glory 
All the year, the sombre log-cock. 
Would you seek him? Borrow owl wings 
Soft as darkness, light as lake-mist; 
( 124 ) 



THE LOG-COCK 

Learn to tread the leaves with fox feet. 
Like the hare to cross the snow-drifts. 
Learn to burrow like the woodchuck, 
Learn to listen like the partridge. 
Learn to wait as does the wild cat. 
Learn to start as does the red deer; 
Wary, watchful, is the log-cock, 
Mai> among his foes most dreading. 



Frank Bolles. 



SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP 

A GOLD fringe on the purpling hem 

Of hills the river runs, 
As down its long, green valley falls 

The last of summer's suns. 
Along its tawny gravel-bed • 

Broad-flowing, swift, and still, 
As if its meadow levels felt 

The hurry of the hill, 
Noiseless between its banks of green 

From curve to curve it slips; 
The drowsy maple-shadows rest 

Like fingers on its lips. 

A waif from Carroll's wildest hills, 

Unstoried and unknown; 
The ursine legend of its name 

Prowls on its banks alone. 
Yet flowers as fair its slopes adorn 

As ever Yarrow grew, 
Or, under rainy Irish skies. 

By Spenser's Mulla grew; 
( 126 ) 



SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP 

And through the gaps of leaning trees 

Its mountain cradle shows : 
The gold against the amethyst, 

The green against the rose. 

Touched by a light that hath no name, 

A glory never sung, 
Aloft on sky and mountain wall 

Are God*s great pictures hung. 
How changed the summits vast and old! 

No longer granite-browed, 
They melt in rosy mist; the rock 

Is softer than the cloud; 
The valley holds its breath; no leaf 

Of all its elms is twirled : 
The silence of eternity 

Seems falling on the world. 



The pause before the breaking seals 

Of mystery is this; 
Yon miracle-play of night and day 

Makes dumb its witnesses. 
What unseen altar crowns the hills 

That reach up stair on stair.^ 
( 127 ) 



SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP 

What eyes look through, what white wings fan 

These purple veils of air? 
What Presence from the heavenly heights 

To those of earth stoops down? 
Not vainly Hellas dreamed of gods 

On Ida's snowy crown! 

• 
Slow fades the vision of the sky, 

The golden water pales, 
And over all the valley-land 

A gray-winged vapor sails. 
I go the common way of all; 

The sunset fires will burn, 
The flowers will blow, the river flow, 

When I no more return. 
No whisper from the mountain pine 

Nor lapsing stream shall tell 
The stranger, treading where I tread. 

Of him who loved them well. 

• ..••••.a 

Farewell ! These smiling hills must wear 

Too soon their wintry frown, 
And snow-cold winds from off them shake 

The maple's red leaves down. 
( 128 ) 



SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP 



But I shall see a summer sun 

Still setting broad and low; 
The mountain slopes shall blush and bloom, 

The golden water flow. 
A lover's claim is mine on all 

I see to have and hold, — 
The rose-light of perpetual hills. 

And sunsets never cold ! 

John Greenleaf Whittieb. 



CHOCORUA 

The pioneer of a great company 

That wait behind him, gazing toward the 
east, — 

Mighty ones all, down to the nameless least, — 
Though after him none dares to press, where he 
With bent head listens to the minstrelsy 

Of far waves chanting to the moon, their priest. 

What phantom rises up from winds deceased? 
What whiteness of the unapproachable sea? 

Hoary Chocorua guards his mystery well: 
He pushes back his fellows, lest they hear 

The haunting secret he apart must tell 
To his lone self, in the sky-silence clear: 
A shadowy, cloud-cloaked wraith, with shoulders 

bowed, 
He steals, conspicuous, from the mountain-crowd. 

Lucy Larcom.

THE LAKE-LAND 



O gems of sapphire, granite-set! 

hills that charmed horizons fret! 

1 know how fair your morns can break. 
In rosy light on isle and lake! 

Whittieb. 



THE LAKESIDE 

The shadows round the inland sea 

Are deepening into night; 
Slow up the slopes of Ossipee 

They chase the lessening light. 
Tired of the long day's blinding heat, 

I rest my languid eye. 
Lake of the Hills! where, cool and sweet. 

Thy sunset waters lie ! 

Along the sky, in wavy lines, 

O'er isle and reach and bay. 
Green-belted with eternal pines. 

The mountains stretch away. 
Below, the maple masses sleep 

Where shore with water blends. 
While midway on the tranquil deep 

The evening light descends. 

So seemed it when yon hill's red crown, 

Of old, the Indian trod. 
And through the sunset air, looked down 

Upon the Smile of God. 
( 133 ) 



THE LAKESIDE 

To him of light and shade the laws 

No forest skeptic taught; 
Their living and eternal Cause 

His truer instinct sought. 

He saw these mountains in the light 

Which now across them shines; 
This lake, in summer sunset bright, 

Walled round with sombering pines. 
God near him seemed; from earth and skies 

His loving voice he heard, 
As, face to face, in Paradise, 

Man stood before the Lord. 

Thanks, O our Father! that, like him. 

Thy tender love I see. 
In radiant hill and woodland dim, 

And tinted sunset sea. 
For not in mockery dost Thou fill 

Our earth with light and grace; 
Thou hid'st no dark and cruel will 

Behind Thy smiling face! 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



AT ALTON BAY 

'"We saw in the distance the dusky lake fade. 

Empurpled with twilight's last tinges; 
And slow came the Night, with her curtains of 
shade, 
And the round rosy moon in their fringes. 
We marked in the sky, in the cloud-lakes on 
high. 
The flocks of birds dreamily sailing 
From the peaks in the West, and settle to rest 
Where the forest light slowly was failing. 
Round bright Alton Bay. 

Mist curtained the mountains, — we climbed the 
dark heights. 
But a feeling of sadness came o'er us. 
As we saw on the hillsides the camp-meeting lights. 

And heard the lone worshippers' chorus — 
"It is well with my soul!" — how it echoed afar 

O'er the lake in the deep mountain shadows, 
While bright in the sky shone the evening star 
O'er the lonely lake islands and meadows 
At still Alton Bay. 
( 135 ) 



AT ALTON BAY 

I knew not the singers, their creeds or their 
names; 
I heard but the chorus ascending, 
While bright through the pines shone the night- 
torches' flames 
With the rays of the shaded moon blending; 
And I said on that night, as I stood on the 
height. 
When time measures my joy and my sorrow. 
My life I would close as the birds seek repose. 
To dream of a beautiful morrow 
At dim Alton Bay. 

Then we talked of the main, and its night-dark- 
ened plain. 
Of the sweet prayer of trust on the billows; 
The worshippers' strain rising sweet in the fane 

In the vale by the cool village willows; 
The cathedral's aisle dim, the antiphonal hymn. 

The baptismal vow at the fountain : 
Yet more grand seemed the word that our charmed 
ears had heard — 
"It is well with my soul!" — on the mountain, 
At calm Alton Bay. 
( 136 ) 



AT ALTON BAY 



Morn lighted the bay, our boat glided away. 

But the fair lake I see as a vision; 
And in dreams hear again the lone camp-meeting's 
strain 
Like a call from the portals elysian. 
When the shade of the past shall be lengthened at 
last, 
And the earth light around me Is paling. 
May some holy song's breath on the mountain of 
faith 
Turn my heart to the Refuge unfailing. 
As at far Alton Bay. 

Hezekiah Butterworth. 



A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE 

To kneel before some saintly shrine. 
To breathe the health of airs divine, 
Or bathe where sacred rivers flow, 
The cowled and turbaned pilgrims go. 
I too, a palmer, take, as they 
With staff and scallop-shell, my way 
To feel, from burdening cares and ills. 
The strong uplifting of the hills. 

The years are many since, at first. 
For dreamed-of wonders all athirst, 
I saw on Winnipesaukee fall 
The shadow of the mountain wall. 
Ah ! where are they who sailed with me 
The beautiful island-studded sea? 
And am I he whose keen surprise 
Flashed out from such unclouded eyes? 

Still, when the sun of summer burns. 
My longing for the hills returns; 
And northward, leaving at my back 
The warm vale of the Merrimack, 
( 138 ) 



A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE 

I go to meet the winds of morn, 
Blown down the hill-gaps, mountain-born. 
Breathe scent of pines, and satisfy 
The hunger of a lowland eye. 

Again I see the day decline 
Along a ridged horizon line; 
Touching the hill-tops, as a nun 
Her beaded rosary, sinks the sun. 
One lake lies golden, which shall soon 
Be silver in the rising moon; 
And one, the crimson of the skies 
And mountain purple multiplies. 

With the untroubled quiet blends 
The distance-softened voice of friends; 
The girl's light laugh no discord brings 
To the low song the pine-tree sings; 
And, not unwelcome, comes the hail 
Of boyhood from his nearing sail. 
And human presence breaks no spell. 
And sunset still is miracle! 

Calm as the hour, methinks I feel 
A sense of worship o*er me steal; 
( 139 ) 



A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE 

Not that of satyr-charming Pan, 
No cult of Nature shaming Man, 
Not Beauty's self, but that which lives 
And shines through all the veil, it weaves, - 
Soul of the mountain, lake, and wood. 
Their witness to the Eternal Good ! 

And if, by fond illusion, here 

The earth to heaven seems drawing near. 

And yon outlying range invites 

To other and serener heights. 

Scarce hid behind its topmost swell. 

The shining Mounts Delectable! 

A dream may hint of truth no less 

Than the sharp light of wakefulness. 

As through her veil of incense smoke 
Of old the spell-rapt priestess spoke. 
More than her heathen oracle. 
May not this trance of sunset tell 
That Nature's forms of loveliness 
Their heavenly archetypes confess. 
Fashioned like Israel's ark alone 
From patterns in the Mount made known? 
( 140 ) 



A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE 

A holier beauty overbroods 
These fair and faint simiHtudes; 
Yet not unblest is he who sees 
Shadows of God's reahties, 
And knows beyond this masquerade 
Of shape and color, light and shade, 
And dawn and set, and wax and wane, 
Eternal verities remain. 

O gems of sapphire, granite set ! 

hills that charmed horizons fret! 

1 know how fair your morns can break. 
In rosy light on isle and lake; 

How over wooded slopes can run 
The noonday play of cloud and sun, 
And evening droop her oriflamme 
Of gold and red in still Asquam. 



The summer moons may round again. 
And careless feet these hills profane; 
These sunsets waste on vacant eyes 
The lavish splendor of the skies; 
Fashion and folly, misplaced here. 
Sigh for their natural atmosphere, 
( 141 ) 



A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE 

And travelled pride the outlook scorn 
Of lesser heights than Matterhorn: 

But let me dream that hill and sky 
Of unseen beauty prophesy; 
And in these tinted lakes behold 
The trailing of the raiment fold 
Of that which, still eluding gaze. 
Allures to upward-tending ways, 
Whose footprints make, wherever found, 
Our common earth a holy ground. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



PASQUANEY 

Ah, Loch Katrine, 
Thy beauties have the bards of Scotia sung 
From days untold; 

And every clime has seen 
Thy crystal p)ool by mountains overhung. 

Thy tints of gold, — 
But not for me thy charms, fair Loch Katrine; 

For I will dream my summer hours away 

Where on the beach the lazy ripples play 
Of that sweet lake unsung and half unknown, - 
Pasquaney, 'mid the forest dells alone. 

Why cross the sea. 
To view the Trossachs wild in Scotia's land? 
For mile on mile 
The rugged mountains free 
About my lake are piled on every hand. 

And Ellen's Isle 
Beneath a beetling cliff here one may see; 
And bare and lone against the western skies 
Behold the sentry peak Ben Ledi rise. 
O that another "Wizard of the North" 
Might rise to sound their modest praises forth. 
( 143 •) 



PASQUANEY 

And bright Lemain, 
The sad-souled Byron found delight in thee. 
And every clime 

Has joined in rapturous strain 
To praise fair Como, gem of Italy; 

But no dark crime 
Has dyed Pasquaney with unseemly stain, 

For on my lake there stands no dark Chillon, 

With dungeon towers to dim the rays of morn; 
No haughty Rome has ever ruled by thee. 
Thy streams are fetterless, thy waves are free. 

O mountain lake, 
Would I could free thee from a name uncouth. 
And could restore 
The name that thou didst take 
From that dark race that loved thy lonely youth 

In days of yore — 
The name that hints of breezes half awake. 
The voice of wild ducks sporting in the flags. 
The trout's bold leap, the rustling birches' rags. 
The honk of wild geese on an autumn noon. 
The wild, unearthly laughter of the loon. 

Fred Lewis Pattee. 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Where the Great Lake's sunny smiles 
Dimple round its hundred isles, 
And the mountain's granite ledge 
Cleaves the water like a wedge. 
Ringed about with smooth, gray stones. 
Rest the giant's mighty bones. 

Close beside, in shade and gleam. 
Laughs and ripples Melvin stream; 
Melvin water, mountain-born. 
All fair flowers its banks adorn; 
All the woodland's voices meet. 
Mingling with its murmurs sweet. 

Over lowlands forest-grown. 
Over waters island-strown. 
Over silver-sanded beach, 
Leaf-locked bay and misty reach, 
Melvin stream and burial-heap. 
Watch and ward the mountains keep. 
( 145 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Who that Titan cromlech fills? 
Forest-kaiser, lord o* the hills? 
Knight who on the birchen tree 
Carved his savage heraldry? 
Priest o' the pine-wood temples dim. 
Prophet, sage, or wizard grim? 

Rugged type of primal man, 
Grim utilitarian. 

Loving woods for hunt and prowl, 
Lake and hill for fish and fowl. 
As the brown bear bhnd and dull 
To the grand and beautiful : 

Not for him the lesson drawn 
From the mountains smit with dawn. 
Star-rise, moon-rise, flowers of May, 
Sunset's purple bloom of day, — 
Took his life no hue from thence. 
Poor amid such affluence? 

Haply unto hills and tree 
All too near akin was he: 
Unto him who stands afar 
( 146 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Nature's marvels greatest are; 
Who the mountain purple seeks 
Must not climb the higher peaks. 

Yet who knows, in winter tramp, 
Or the midnight of the camp, 
What revealings faint and far, 
Stealing down from moon and star, 
Kindled in that human clod 
Thought of destiny and God? 

Stateliest forest patriarch, 

Grand in robes of skin and bark. 

What sepulchral mysteries. 

What weird funeral-rites, were his? 

What sharp wail, what drear lament, 

Back scared wolf and eagle sent? 

Now, whate'er he may have been. 
Low he lies as other men; 
On his mound the partridge drums. 
There the noisy blue-jay comes; 
Rank nor name nor pomp has he 
In the grave's democracy. 
( 147 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAItE 

Part thy blue lips, Northern lake! 
Moss-grown rocks, your silence break! 
Tell the tale, thou ancient tree! 
Thou, too, slide- worn Ossipee! 
Speak, and tell us how and when 
Lived and died this king of men! 

Wordless moans the ancient pine; 
Lake and mountain give no sign; 
Vain to trace this ring of stones; 
Vain the search of crumbling bones: 
Deepest of all mysteries. 
And the saddest, silence is. 

Nameless, noteless, clay with clay 
Mingles slowly day by day; 
But somewhere, for good or ill, 
That dark soul is living still; 
Somewhere yet that atom's force 
Moves the light-poised universe. 

Strange that on his burial-sod 
Harebells bloom, and golden-rod. 
While the soul's dark horoscope 
( 148 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Holds no starry sign of hope ! 
Is the Unseen with sight at odds? 
Nature's pity more than God's? 

This I mused by Melvin's side. 
While the summer eventide 
Made the woods and inland sea 
And the mountains mystery; 
And the hush of earth and air 
Seemed the pause before a prayer, — 

Prayer for him, for all who rest. 

Mother Earth, upon thy breast, — 

Lapped on Christian turf, or hid 

In rock-cave or pyramid : 

All who sleep, as all who live. 

Well may need the prayer, "Forgive!" 

Desert-smothered caravan, 
Knee-deep dust that once was man^ 
Battle-trenches ghastly piled. 
Ocean-floors with white bones tiled, 
Crowded tomb and mounded sod. 
Dumbly crave that prayer to God. 
( 149 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Oh, the generations old 

Over whom no church-bells tolled, 

Christless, lifting up blind eyes 

To the silence of the skies! 

For the innumerable dead 

Is my soul disquieted. 

Where be now these silent hosts? 
Where the camping-ground of ghosts? 
Where the spectral conscripts led 
To the white tents of the dead? 
What strange shore or chartless sea 
Holds the awful mystery? 

Then the warm sky stooped to make 
Double sunset in the lake; 
While above I saw with it, 
Range on range, the mountains lit; 
And the calm and splendor stole 
Like an answer to my soul. 

Hear'st thou, O of little faith. 
What to thee the mountain saith. 
What is whispered by the trees? — 
( 150 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

"Cast on God thy care for these; 
Trust Him, if thy sight be dim: 
Doubt for them is doubt of Him. 

"Blind must be their close-shut eyes 
Where like night the sunshine lies, 
Fiery-linked the self-forged chain 
Binding ever sin to pain, 
Strong their prison-house of will, 
But without He waiteth still. 

"Not with hatred's undertow 
Doth the Love Eternal flow; 
Every chain that spirits wear 
Crumbles in the breath of prayer; 
And the penitent's desire 
Opens every gate of fire. 

"Still Thy love, O Christ arisen. 
Yearns to reach these souls in prison! 
Through all depths of sin and loss 
Drops the plummet of Thy cross ! 
Never yet abyss was found 
Deeper than that cross could sound!" 
( 151 ) 



THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE 

Therefore well may Nature keep 
Equal faith with all who sleep, 
Set her watch of hills around 
Christian grave and heathen mound. 
And to cairn and kirkyard send 
Summer's flowery dividend. 

Keep, O pleasant Melvin stream. 
Thy sweet laugh in shade and gleam! 
On the Indian's grassy tomb 
Swing, O flowers, your bells of bloom ! 
Deep below, as high above. 
Sweeps the circle of God's love. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



AT WINNIPESAUKEE 

O SILENT hills across the lake, 

Asleep in moonlight, or awake 

To catch the color of the sky. 

That sifts through every cloud swept by, — 

How beautiful ye are, in change 

Of sultry haze and storm-light strange; 

How dream-like rest ye on the bar 

That parts the billow from the star; 

How blend your mists with waters clear. 

Till earth floats off, and heaven seems near! 

Ye faint and fade, a pearly zone. 
The coast-line of a land unknown. 
Yet that is sunburnt Ossipee, 
Plunged knee-deep in yon glistening sea: 
Somewhere among these grouping isles, 
Old Whiteface from his cloud-cap smiles. 
And gray Chocorua bends his crown, 
To look on happy hamlets down; 
( 153 ) 



AT WINNIPESAUKEE 

And every pass and mountain-slope 
Leads out and on some human hope. 

Here, the great hollows of the hills. 
The glamour of the June day fills. 
Along the climbing path, the brier, 
In rose-bloom beauty beckoning higher. 
Breathes sweetly the warm uplands over; 
And, gay with buttercups and clover. 
Smooth slopes of meadowy freshness make 
A green foil to the sparkling lake. 

So is it with yon hills that swim 
Upon the horizon, blue and dim : 
For all the summer is not ours; 
On other shores familiar flowers 
Find blossoming as fresh as these, 
In shade and shine and eddying breeze; 
And scented slopes as cool and green. 
To kiss of lisping ripples lean. 

So is it with the land beyond 
This earth we press with step so fond. 
Upon those faintly-outlined hills 
God's sunshine sleeps, his dew distills; 
( 154 ) 



AT WINNIPESAUKEE 

The dear beatitudes of home 
Within the heavenly boundaries come: 
The hearts that made life's fragrance here. 
To Eden-haunts bring added cheer; 
And all the beauty, all the good, 
Lost to our lower altitude. 
Transfigured, yet the same, are given. 
Upon the mountain-heights of heaven. 

O cloud-swathed hills the flood across. 
Ye hide the mystery of our loss. 
Yet hide it but a little while: 
Past sunlit shore and shadowy isle. 
Out to the still Lake's farther brim. 
Erelong our bark the wave shall skim : 
And what the vigor and the glow 
Our earthly-torpid souls shall know. 
When, grounding on the silver sands. 
We feel the clasp of loving hands. 
And see the walls of sapphire gleam. 
Nor tongue can tell, nor heart can dream. 



But in your rifts of wondrous light 
Wherewith these lower fields are bright, 
( 155 ) 



AT WINNIPESAUKEE 

In every strengthening breeze that brings 
The mountain-health upon its wings. 
We own the gift of Pentecost, 
And not one hint of heaven is lost. 

Lucy Larcom. 



THE HILL-TOP 

The burly driver at my side, 

We slowly climbed the hill, 
Whose summit, in the hot noontide. 

Seemed rising, rising still. 
At last, our short noon-shadows hid 

The top-stone, bare and brown. 
From whence, like Gizeh's pyramid. 

The rough mass slanted down. 

I felt the cool breath of the North; 

Between me and the sun, 
0*er deep, still lake, and ridgy earth, 

I saw the cloud-shades run. 
Before me, stretched for glistening miles. 

Lay mountain-girdled Squam; 
Like green-winged birds, the leafy isles 

Upon its bosom swam. 

And, glimmering through the sun-haze warm. 

Far as the eye could roam, 
Dark billows of an earthquake storm 

Beflecked with clouds like foam, 
( 157) 



THE HILL-TOP 

Their vales in misty shadow deep, 

Their rugged peaks in shine, 
I saw the mountain ranges sweep 

The horizon's northern Hne. 

There towered Chocorua's peak; and west, 

Moosehillock's woods were seen. 
With many a nameless slide-scarred crest 

And pine-dark gorge between. 
Beyond them, like a sun-rimmed cloud. 

The great Notch mountains shone, 
Watched over by the solemn-browed 

And awful face of stone! 

'A good look-off!" the driver spake: 
"About this time last year, 
I drove a party to the Lake, 

And stopped, at evening, here. 
*T was duskish down below; but all 

These hills stood in the sun. 
Till, dipped behind yon purple wall, 

He left them, one by one. 

'A lady, who, from Thornton Hill, 
Had held her place outside,

THE HILL-TOP 

And, as a pleasant woman will, 
Had cheered the long, dull ride. 

Besought me, with so sweet a smile. 
That — though I hate delays — 

I could not choose but rest awhile, — 
(These women have such ways!) 

*0n yonder mossy ledge she sat. 

Her sketch upon her knees, 
A stray brown lock beneath her hat 

Unrolling in the breeze; 
Her sweet face, in the sunset light 

Upraised and glorified, — 
I never saw a prettier sight 

In all my mountain ride. 

'As good as fair; it seemed her joy 

To comfort and to give; 
My poor, sick wife, and cripple boy. 

Will bless her while they live!" 
The tremor in the driver's tone 

His manhood did not shame: 
I daresay, sir, you may have known — " 

He named a well-known name. 
( 159 ) 



THE HILL-TOP 

Then sank the pyramidal mounds. 

The blue lake fled away; 
For mountain-scope a parlor's bounds, 

A lighted hearth for day ! 
From lonely years and weary miles 

The shadows fell apart; 
Kind voices cheered, sweet human smiles 

Shone warm into my heart. 

We journeyed on; but earth and sky 

Had power to charm no more; 
Still dreamed my inward-turning eye 

The dream of memory o*er. 
Ah! human kindness, human love, — 

To few who seek denied, — 
Too late we learn to prize above 

The whole round w orld beside ! 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 




TO LAKE SUNAPEE 



Lake of the wild fowl, Soonipi the Blest! 
Agleam in gold of summer day begun. 
Rosed with the crimson ray of stooping sun. 
Jewelled by pallid planet in the west — 
Oh ! thou art beautiful, whatever the test — 
Slumbering through painted trees through au- 
tumn's noon, 
Pulsing with snow-cast fires, Aurora-won — 
I love thy laughing May-time face the best. 
Ah me! how oft, when passions stir the soul. 
And midnight labor burns away the brain, 
Fancy doth limn thy trembling streamlets fleckt, 
Each warbling dell, each orchis-trodden knoll; 
I live the listless, halcyon hours again. 
And find strange solace in the retrospect. 

John Duncan Quackenbos.

SUNSET ON LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE 

A CLOUD of pearl and rose lies low in the burning 

west; 
On a couch of crimson and gold the sun sinks down 

to rest; 
The distant hills and woods are touched with the 

mellow glow, 
And his parting smile is shed on the dreaming lake 

below. 

It gleams on the snowy sail afloat on the rosy 

tide, 
And falls with a gracious light on Gunstock's 

rugged side; 
But the crimson turns to gold, and the gold turns 

into gray. 
And a breathless hush of peace sweeps over the 

dying day. 

While up from the quiet shore the lengthened 

shadows creep, 
And the robins chirp good-night ere they fold their 

wings in sleep;

SUNSET ON LAKE WINNIPES AUKEE 

From the belt of darkened pines that skirt the 

rocky hill 
Borne on the evening breeze comes the call of the 

whip-poor-will. 

The last pale ray departs, and the lingering day- 
light dies. 

And only a pearly gleam remains in the western 

I skies; 

In the dark and shadowed lake the summer star- 
light gleams — 

Night spreads her brooding wings and folds the 
earth in dreams.

STORM ON LAKE ASQUAM 

A CLOUD, like that the old-time Hebrew saw 
On Carmel prophesying rain, began 
To lift itself o'er wooded Cardigan, 

Growing and blackening. Suddenly, a flaw 

Of chill wind menaced; then a strong blast beat 
Down the long valley's murmuring pines, and 

woke 
The noon-dream of the sleeping lake, and broke 

Its smooth steel mirror at the mountains* feet. 

Thunderous and vast, a fire- veined darkness swept 
Over the rough pine- bearded Asquam range; 
A wraith of tempest, wonderful and strange, 

From peak to peak the cloudy giant stepped. 

One moment, as if challenging the storm, 
Chocorua's tall, defiant sentinel 
Looked from his watch-tower; then the shadow 
fell. 
And the wild rain-drift blotted out his form. 
( 164 )

V STORM ON LAKE ASQUAM 

And over all the still unhidden sun, 

I Weaving its fight through slant-blown veils of 
rain, 
Smiled on the trouble, as hope smiles on pain; 
And, when the tumult and the strife were done. 

With one foot on the lake and one on land. 
Framing within his crescent's tinted streak 
A far-off picture of the Melvin peak, 

Sp)ent broken clouds the rainbow's angel spanned. 
John Greenleaf Whittier. 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

« 

Should you go to Center Harbor, 
As haply you sometime may. 

Sailing up the Winnipesaukee 
From the hills of Alton Bay, — 

Into the heart of the highlands. 

Into the north wind free, 
Through the rising and vanishing islands. 

Over the mountain sea, — 

To the little hamlet lying 

White in its mountain fold, 
Asleep by the lake and dreaming 

A dream that is never told, — 

And in the Red Hill's shadow 
Your pilgrim home you make, 

Where the chambers open to sunrise. 
The mountains, and the lake, — 

If the pleasant picture wearies. 
As the fairest sometimes will, 
( 166 ) 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

And the weight of the hills lies on you. 
And the water is all too still, — 

If in vain the peaks of Gunstock 

Redden with sunrise fire, 
And the sky and the purple mountains 

And the sunset islands tire, — 

If you turn from in-door thrumming 
And the clatter of bowls without. 

And the folly that goes on its travels. 
Bearing the city about, — 

And the cares you left behind you 
Come hunting along your track. 

As Blue-Cap in German fable 
Rode on the traveller's pack, — 

Let me tell you a tender story 
Of one w^ho is now no more, 

A tale to haunt like a spirit 
The Winnipesaukee shore, — 

Of one who was brave and gentle, 
And strong for manly strife, 
( 167 ) 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

Riding with cheering and music 
Into the tourney of life. 

Faltering and failing midway 
In the Tempter's subtle snare. 

The chains of an evil habit 
He bowed himself to bear. 

Over his fresh young manhood 
The bestial veil was flung, — 

The curse of the wine of Circe, 
The spell her weavers sung. 

Yearly did hill and lakeside 
Their summer idyls frame; 

Alone in his darkened dwelling 
He hid his face for shame. 

The music of life's great marches 
Sounded for him in vain; 

The voices of human duty 
Smote on his ear like pain. 

In vain over island and water 
The curtains of sunset swung; 
( 168 ) 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

In vain on the beautiful mountains 
The pictures of God were hung. 

The wretched years crept onward, 

Each sadder than the last; 
All the bloom of life fell from him, 

All the freshness and greenness past. 

But deep in his heart forever 

And unprofaned he kept 
The love of his saintly mother. 

Who in the graveyard slept. 

His house had no pleasant pictures; 

Its comfortless walls were bare : 
But the riches of earth and ocean 

Could not purchase his mother's chair. 

The old chair, quaintly carven. 
With oaken arms outspread. 

Whereby, in the long gone twilights 
His childish prayers were said. 

For thence in his lone night watches. 
By moon or starlight dim, 
( 169 ) 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

A face full of love and pity 
And tenderness looked on him. 

And oft, as the grieving presence 

Sat in his mother's chair, 
The groan of his self-upbraiding 

Grew into wordless prayer. 

At last, in the moonless midnight. 
The summoning angel came. 

Severe in his pity, touching 

The house with fingers of flame. 

The red light flashed from its windows 
And flared from its sinking roof; 

And baffled and awed before it 
The villagers stood aloof. 

They shrank from the falling rafters. 
They turned from the furnace glare; 

But its tenant cried, "God help me! 
I must save my mother's chair!" 

Under the blazing portal, 
Over the floor of fire, 
( 170 ) 



A LEGEND OF THE LAKE 

He seemed, in the terrible splendor, 
A martyr on his pyre! 

In his face the mad flames smote him. 
And stimg him on either side; 

But he clung to the sacred relic, — 
By his mother's chair he died! 

O mother, with human yearnings! 

O saint, by the altar stairs! 
Shall not the dear God give thee 

The child of thy many prayers? 

O Christ ! by whom the loving. 
Though erring, are forgiven. 

Hast thou for him no refuge. 
No quiet place in heaven? 



Give palms to thy strong martyrs. 
And crown thy saints with gold. 

But let the mother welcome 
Her lost one to thy fold. 

John GREENLEAr Whittier. 



LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE 

We know not which is fairer, the repose 
Of verdured islands, or the tremulous foam 
That guards them, as the ancients cradled 
Rome — 

Cherished in splendor. To the heights gleam those 

Majestic sentinels that silence knows 
And the proud heavens; — Chocorua's lofty 

home, 
Ossipee, Whiteface, Belknap's double dome, 

Lone Washington and Lafayette, where glows 
A grandeur that exceedeth mortal ken. 

Lake of the hills, thou art the link to bind 

Yon mountains and our souls! thy beating breast. 

Less equable, endears the humble mind; 

For had ye, Hills, no human bonds confest. 
Ye were the shrine of gods and not of men ! 

Fanny Runnells Poole.

TO LAKE ASQUAM 

.^Egean seas are wondrous fair, 

And Como*s waters clear; 
Killarney's lakes, far-famed in song. 

To Irish hearts are dear. 
But girted round by northern hills. 

The fairest waters play 
That e*er a summer sunset tinged 

With gold at close of day. 

Fair Asquam, nestling in thy vale. 

Where all is peace and rest. 
Whose islands on thy bosom sleep 

As on a mother's breast! 
I dream by thee till evening shades 

Upon thy waves I see, 
Then turn from thy beatitudes 

To leave my peace with thee. 

Walter Peaslee.

THE WOOD GIANT 

From Alton Bay to Sandwich Dome, 

From Mad to Saco river. 
For patriarchs of the primal wood 

We sought with vain endeavor. 

At last to us a woodland path. 

To open sunset leading, 
Revealed the Anakim of pines 

Our wildest wish exceeding. 

Alone, the level sun before; 

Below, the lake's green islands; 
Beyond, in misty distance dim. 

The rugged Northern Highlands. 

Dark Titan on his Sunset Hill 

Of time and change defiant! 
How dwarfed the common woodland seemed, 

Before the old-time giant! 

What marvel that, in simpler days 
Of the world's early childhood, 
( 174 ) 



THE WOOD GIANT 

Men crowned with garlands, gifts, and praise. 
Such monarchs of the wild-wood? 

That Tyrian maids with flower and song 
Danced through the hill grove's spaces. 

And hoary -bearded Druids found 
In woods their holy places? 

With somewhat of that Pagan awe 
With Christian reverence blending, 

We saw our pine-tree's mighty arms 
Above our heads extending. 

We heard his needles' mystic rune. 

Now rising, and now dying, 
As erst Dodona's priestess heard 

The oak leaves prophesying. 

Was it the half-unconscious moan 

Of one apart and mateless. 
The weariness of unshared p>ower. 

The loneliness of greatness? 

O dawns and sunsets, lend to him 
Your beauty and your wonder ! 
( 175 ) 



THE WOOD GIANT 

Blithe sparrow, sing thy summer song 
His solemn shadow under! 

Play lightly on his slender keys, 

O wind of summer, waking 
For hills like these the sound of seas 

On far-off beaches breaking! 

And let the eagle and the crow 

Find shelter in his branches. 
When winds shake down his winter snow 

In silver avalanches. 

The brave are braver for their cheer. 

The strongest need assurance, 
The sigh of longing makes not less 

The lesson of endurance.

LAKE SUNAPEE 

Oh, how delightful is the mountain air 

Cooled on thy crested water, Sunapee ! 

We wonder if Lake Leman is more fair. 

More sweet the gales of storied Araby. 

We breathe the breath of lilies, and the balm 

Of woods forever green, while from the calm 

Like sounds of far-off voices drawing near. 

The coming of the summer wind we hear 

In the long branches; rising like a psalm 

Of peace upon thy shore, more sweet, more clear 

Than song of angels to the morning star. 

When, from the rifted darkness of old time, 

Kearsarge and Sunapee arose sublime 

To watch thy face forever, from afar.

FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS 

Around Sebago's lonely lake 
There lingers not a breeze to break 
The mirror which its waters make. 

The solemn pines along its shore, 

The firs which hang its gray rocks o'er, 

Are painted on its glassy floor. 

The sun looks o'er, with hazy eye. 
The snowy mountain-tops which lie 
Piled coldly up against the sky. 

Dazzling and white ! save where the bleak, 
Wild winds have bared some splintering peak, 
Or snow-slide left its dusky streak. 

Yet green are Saco's banks below, 
And belts of spruce and cedar show. 
Dark fringing round those cones of snow* 

The earth hath felt the breath of spring. 
Though yet on her deliverer's wing 
The lingering frosts of winter cling. 
( 178 ) 



FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS 

Fresh grasses fringe the meadow-brooks. 
And mildly from its sunny nooks 
The blue eye of the violet looks. 

And odors from the springing grass, 
The sweet birch and the sassafras, 
Upon the scarce-felt breezes pass. 

Her tokens of renewing care 
Hath Nature scattered everywhere. 
In bud and flower, and warmer air. 

But in their hour of bitterness, 
What reck the broken Sokokis, 
Beside their slaughtered chief, of this? 

The turf's red stain is still undried, 
Scarce have the death-shot echoes died 
Along Sebago's wooded side; 



And silent now the hunters stand, 
Grouped darkly, where a swell of land 
Slopes upward from the lake's white sand. 
( 179 ) 



FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS 

Fire and the axe have swept it bare. 
Save one lone beech, unclosing there 
Its light leaves in the vernal air. 

With grave, cold looks, all sternly mute, 
They break the damp turf at its foot, 
And bare its coiled and twisted root. 

They heave the stubborn trunk aside, 
The firm roots from the earth divide, — 
The rent beneath yawns dark and wide. 

And there the fallen chief is laid, 
In tasselled garb of skins arrayed, 
And girded with his wampum-braid. 

The silver cross he loved is pressed 
Beneath the heavy arms, which rest 
Upon his scarred and naked breast. 

*T is done: the roots are backward sent. 
The beechen-tree stands up unbent. 
The Indian's fitting monument!

THE VOICE ON THE MOUNTAIN 



IH O'er the waters of Pasquaney, 
PV On the mountain ragged, thorny, 

Wild and rising from the waters, rising sheer, 
IB I>v\'ells an imp or nymph or woman, 
* With a mellow voice quite human. 

Never failing, never ceasing, sweet to hear; 
Joining in my songs of gladness. 
Sighing in my hours of sadness. 
Sighing, laughing, never far and never near. 
"Ah me! Ha! ha! Ah woe!" 

Comes the voice or high or low, 
"Ah me! Ha! ha! Ah woe!" 



II 



For her story I beseech her, 
"Art thou, then, some wayward creature. 
Half a maiden, half a fairy, sad and lone. 

Longing for the love of mortal. 

Yet debarred from that blest portal. 
Longing, pining till thou hast but voice alone? 

Or the ghost of dusky maiden 

Lingering there with sorrow laden. 
Grieving, sighing, for the happy days long flown? 
( 181 ) 



THE VOICE ON THE MOUNTAIN 

Alas! Alas! To know!" 
Came an answer sad and low, 
"A lass? A lass? O, no." 

Wilt thou drive me quite to madness? 
Thou art then the imp of sadness. 
Oft the world seems black and lonely and forlorn. 
And I cry, "Life is a shadow 
Like the fog upon the meadow, 
Like the flashing, flimsy dew-web of the morn; 
Youth is but a time for sighing. 
Age is but a time for dying, 
All between a paltry bubble quickly torn; — 
Our life is pain ! Ah, woe!" 
Came the far voice, soft and low, 
"Your life is pain? Ah, no." 

Ah, I hail the nymph of gladness. 
In thy voice no trace of sadness ; — 
Sometimes of a summer morning all is bright. 
And I cry, "Oh, life is sweetness; 
Earth has given in completeness 
Heavenly sounds and fragrant perfumes, and our 
sight 

( 182 ) 



THE VOICE ON THE MOUNTAIN 

Has regaled with floods of beauty 
Till it seems our only duty 
Just to praise God for the sweetness and the light; — 
My life's all joy, I know." 
Came the voice no longer low, 
"Thy life's all joy? Ah, no!" 

What, then, art thou, wayward creature. 
Thou who hast not sense or feature. 
Save a voice that sympathizes with my soul? 
If not imp or nymph or maiden. 
If not shade with sadness laden, 
Why dost enter every mood, oh why condole 
When my heart with grief is breaking. 
Laugh when joy has stopped its aching ! 
I would know thee, love thee, seek thee and con- 
sole; — 

A voice? Oh, more, I know!" 
Came the whisper sighing low, 
"A voice, — no more, ah no!" 

Fred Lewis Pattee. 



WINNIPESAUKEE 

A WORLD of beauty everywhere we go ! 

The mountains gleaming through the hazy veil. 
The deep blue sky where fleecy cloudlets sail, 

Are imaged in the placid lake below, 

Where white in little coves the lilies blow. 
The giant pine trees and the flowerets frail 
Their fragrance on the summer air exhale. 

And beautiful the drifts of daisy snow! 

The dreamy twilight softly on us steals, 

The fire-fly stars come twinkling in the green. 

In distance dim, a plaintive voice appeals 

To "Whip-poor- Will," who ever keeps unseen. 

The moon comes up, across the lake's expanse 

The fairy beams in golden sandals dance.

SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE 

I. NOON 

White clouds, whose shadows haunt the deep. 
Light mists, whose soft embraces keep 
The sunshine on the hills asleep ! 

O isles of calm ! O dark, still wood! 
And stiller skies that overbrood 
Your rest with deeper quietude ! 

O shapes and hues, dim beckoning, through 
Yon mountain gaps, my longing view 
Beyond the purple and the blue, 

To stiller sea and greener land. 

And softer lights and airs more bland, 

And skies, — the hollow of God's hand ! 

Transfused through you, O mountain friends! 
With mine your solemn spirit blends, 
And life no more hath separate ends. 
( 185 ) 



SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE 

I read each misty mountain sign, 
I know the voice of wave and pine, 
And I am yours, and ye are mine. 

Life's burdens fall, its discords cease, 

I lapse into the glad release 

Of Nature's own exceeding peace. 

O welcome calm of heart and mind! 
As falls yon fir-tree's loosened rind 
To leave a tenderer growth behind, 

So fall the weary years away; 
A child again, my head I lay 
Upon the lap of this sweet day. 

This western wind hath Lethean powers. 
Yon noonday cloud nepenthe showers. 
The lake is white with lotus-flowers! 

Even Duty's voice is faint and low, 
And slumberous Conscience, waking slow, 
Forgets her blotted scroll to show. 
( 186 ) 



SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE 

The Shadow which pursues us all, 
Whose ever-nearing steps appall, 
Whose voice we hear behind us call, — 

That Shadow blends with mountain gray. 
It speaks but what the light waves say, — 
Death walks apart from Fear to-day ! 

Rocked on her breast, these pines and I 
Alike on Nature's love rely;' 
And equal seems to live or die. 

Assured that He whose presence fills 
With light the spaces of these hills 
No evil to His creatures wills. 

The simple faith remains, that He 
Will do, whatever that may be. 
The best alike for man and tree. 

What mosses over one shall grow. 
What light and life the other know, 
Unanxious, leaving Him to show. 

( 187 ) 



SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE 
II. EVENING 

Yon mountain's side is black with night, 
While, broad-orbed, o'er its gleaming crown 

The moon, slow-rounding into sight. 
On the hushed inland sea looks down. 

How start to light the clustering isles, 
Each silver-hemmed! How sharply show 

The shadows of their rocky piles. 
And tree-tops in the wave below ! 

How far and strange the mountains seem, 
Dim-looking through the pale, still light! 

The vague, vast grouping of a dream. 
They stretch into the solemn night. 

Beneath, lake, wood, and peopled vale. 
Hushed by that presence grand and grave, 

Are silent, save the cricket's wail. 
And low response of leaf and wave. 

Fair scenes ! whereto the Day and Night 
Make rival love, I leave ye soon, 
( 188 ) 



SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE 

What time before the eastern light 
The pale ghost of the setting moon 

Shall hide behind yon rocky spines, 
And the young archer, Morn, shall break 

His arrows on the mountain pines. 
And, golden-sandalled, walk the lake! 

Farewell ! around this smiling bay 

Gay-hearted Health, and Life in bloom. 

With lighter steps than mine, may stray 
In radiant summers yet to come. 

But none shall more regretful leave 
These waters and these hills than I: 

Or, distant, fonder dream how eve 
Or dawn is painting wave and sky; 

How rising moons shine sad and mild 
On wooded isle and silvering bay; 

Or setting suns beyond the piled 

And purpled mountains lead the day; 

Nor laughing girl, nor bearding boy. 

Nor full-pulsed manhood, lingering here, 
( 189 ) 



SUMMER BY THE I^AKESIDE 

Shall add, to life's abounding joy, 
The charmed repose to suffering dear. 

Still waits kind Nature to impart 
Her choicest gifts to such as gain 

An entrance to her loving heart 

Through the sharp discipline of pain. 

Forever from the Hand that takes 
One blessing from us others fall; 

And, soon or late, our Father makes 
His perfect recompense to all ! 

O, watched by Silence and the Night, 
And folded in the strong embrace 

Of the great mountains, with the light 
Of the sweet heavens upon thy face, 

Lake of the Northland ! keep thy dower 
Of beauty still, and while above 

Thy solemn mountains speak of power. 
Be thou the mirror of God's love. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



EVENING SONG 

The sun is low, and fair Pasquaney sleeps, ^- 
Breathe softly now your vespers, linden leaves. 
The thrushes chant her evening lullaby. 
And reeds and rushes murmuring reply, 
"Pasquaney sleeps; hush, waves! no more she 
grieves." 

Thy bride is sleeping, gray, old mountain peak. 
Guard her sweet beauty from thy rocks above. 
Bend down thy shadows; kiss her rippling 

hair. 
For she is pure as is thy mountain air. 
And fair as are the rosy lips of love. 

Hush ! hush thy babbling, lawless mountain stream, 

For evening mists are robing her in white. 

The darkness veils the wooded landscape o'er. 

And whispers from the ripple-haunted shore, 

"Good night, sweet lake!" and echoes lisp, "Good 

night."

W THE MERRIMACK 

VK From Thk Bridal of Penaoook 

O CHILD of that white-crested mountain whose 

springs 
Gush forth in the shade of the cliff -eagle's wings, 
Down whose slopes to the lowlands thy wild waters 

shine. 
Leaping gray walls of rock, flashing through the 

dwarf pine; 

From that cloud-curtained cradle so cold and so 

lone, 
From the arms of that wintry-locked mother of 

stone, 
By hills hung with forests, through vales wide and 

free. 
Thy mountain-born brightness glanced down to 

the sea! 

No bridge arched thy waters save that where the 

trees 
Stretched their long arms above thee and kissed 

in the breeze: 

( 195 ) 



THE MERRIMACK 

No sound save the lapse of the waves on thy shores. 
The phmging of otters, the light dip of oars. 

Green-tufted, oak-shaded, by Amoskeag*s fall 
Thy twin Uncanoonucs rose stately and tall, 
Thy Nashua meadows lay green and unshorn. 
And the hills of Pentucket were tasselled with com. 

But thy Penacook valley was fairer than these. 
And greener its grasses and taller its trees, 
Ere the sound of an axe in the forest had rung. 
Or the mower his scythe in the meadows had 
swung. 

In their sheltered repose looking out from the wood 
The bark-builded wigwams of Penacook stood. 
There glided the corn-dance, the council-fire shone. 
And against the red war-post the hatchet was 
thrown. 

There the old smoked in silence their pipes, and 

the young 
To the pike and the white-perch their baited lines 
flung;

There the boy shaped his arrows, and there the 

shy maid 
Wove her many-hued baskets and bright wampum

O Stream of the Mountains ! if answer of thine 
Could rise from thy waters to question of mine, 
Methinks through the din of thy thronged banks 

a moan 
Of sorrow would swell for the days which have 

gone. 

Not for thee the dull jar of the loom and the wheel. 
The gliding of shuttles, the ringing of steel; 
But that old voice of waters, of bird and of breeze. 
The dip of the wild-fowl, the rustling of trees ! 

John Greenleaf Whittier.

SACO FALLS 

Rush on, bold stream ! thou sendest up 
Brave notes to all the woods around. 
When morning beams are gathering fast. 

And hushed is every human sound; 
I stand beneath the sombre hill, 
The stars are dim o'er fount and rill. 
And still I hear thy waters play 
In welcome music, far away; 
Dash on, bold stream ! I love the roar 
Thou sendest up from rock and shore. 



*T is night in heaven, — the rustling leaves 

Are whispering of the coming storm. 
And, thundering down the river's bed, 
I see thy lengthened, darkling form; 
No voices from the vales are heard. 
The winds are low, each little bird 
Hath sought its quiet, rocking nest, 
Folded its wings, and gone to rest: 
And still I hear thy waters play 
In welcome music far away.

SACO FALLS 

Oh ! earth hath many a gallant show. 
Of towering peak and glacier height, 

But ne'er, beneath the glorious moon, 
Hath nature framed a lovelier sight 

Than thy fair tide with diamonds fraught, 

When every drop with light is caught. 

And, o'er the bridge, the village girls 

Reflect below their waving curls. 

While merrily thy waters play 

In welcome music, far away !

MAD RIVER 



TRAVELLEB 



Why dost thou wildly rush and roar, 

Mad River, O Mad River? 
Wilt thou not pause and cease to pour 
Thy hurrying, headlong waters o'er 
This rocky shelf forever? 

What secret trouble stirs thy breast? 

Why all this fret and flurry? 
Dost thou not know that what is best 
In this too restless world is rest 

From over-work and worry? 



THE RIVER 

What wouldst thou in these mountains seek, 

O stranger from the city? 
Is it perhaps some foolish freak 
Of thine, to put the words I speak 

Into a plaintive ditty?

MAD RIVER 



TRAVELLER 



Yes; I would learn of thee thy song. 
With all its flowing numbers. 

And in a voice as fresh and strong 

As thine is, sing it all day long. 
And hear it in my slumbers. 

THE RIVER 

A brooklet nameless and unknown 

Was I at first, resembling 
A little child, that all alone 
Comes venturing down the stairs of stone. 

Irresolute and trembling. 

Later, by wayward fancies led, 
For the wide world I panted; 

Out of the forest, dark and dread. 

Across the open fields I fled. 

Like one pursued and haunted. 

I tossed my arms, I sang aloud. 
My voice exultant blending 

( 202 ) 



MAD RIVER 

With thunder from the passing cloud. 

The wind, the forest bent and bowed, 

The rush of rain descending. 

I heard the distant ocean call. 
Imploring and entreating; 
Drawn onw^ard, o'er this rocky wall 
I plunged, and the loud waterfall 
Made answer to the greeting. 

And now, beset with many ills, 

A toilsome life I follow; 
Compelled to carry from the hills 
These logs to the impatient mills 

Below there in the hollow. 

Yet something ever cheers and charms 

The rudeness of my labors; 
Daily I water with these arms 
The cattle of a hundred farms.

Men call me Mad, and well they may. 
When, full of rage and trouble,

MAD RIVER 

I burst my banks of sand and clay. 
And sweep their wooden bridge away. 
Like withered reeds or stubble. 

Now go and write thy little rhyme. 

As of thine own creating. 
Thou seest the day is past its prime; 
I can no longer waste my time; 

The mills are tired of waiting. 

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

SUGAR RIVER 

Let Avon roll with Shakespeare's deathless glory. 
And Thames as smooth as Pope or Thomson 
glide. 

The Tiber, Hellespont, in ancient story 

Reflect Mars' triumphs, or fair Venus' pride; 

While Scotia's every stream can boast its poet. 

Whose patriotic muse would make us know it: 

Yet what to me are all these puffs and praises, 
Or streams of fame in foreign lands that lie? 

But my soft-gliding, native river raises 
A thousand images of home-felt joy; 

And though their names in lofty lays may shine, 

In sweetness they can never equal thine. 

Oh ! may my verse, thy strength and beauty steal- 
ing, 
Flow like thy waters, and thy fame extend ! 
Thou minglest with the tide of life's young feel- 
ing— 
With thee my earliest recollections blend ; —

SUGAR RIVER 

Thy bank my bower, nor Eden's loss was pondered* 
Whilst there in infant innocence I wandered. 

When strengthened reason woke imagination, 
My book, my Croesus wealth, oft borne to thee, 

In some loved nook was sought a fav'rite station, 
The spreading hazel formed a canopy; — 

The red-breast, sweetest bird that charms our 
spring. 

Joined his wild warble to thy murmuring. 

Oft from the page mine eye, with rapture glancing. 
Watched the light-springing trout at sportive 
play, 
Or the bright sunbeams o'er thy dimples dancing. 

Or the blue sky that in thy bosom lay — 
Here, the broad boughs athwart the dark stream 

waving. 
And there, the wild duck's brood their plumage 
laving. 

Nor must be past, while thousand thoughts en- 
dear 'em. 
Thy Falls, my school-day path so often crossed;

SUGAR RIVER 



The wonder-hunter traveller would sneer 'em; 

Beside Niag'ras, these, be sure, were lost. 
Oh ! might I see that Anakim of wonders. 
And watch its rainbowed spray, and hear its thun- 
ders! 

But then I deemed not there could be a vaster. 

When anchor-ice (we called it so) had made 
Thy pent-up waters rage and roar, while faster 
Whirled the white-sheeted foam; though half 
afraid. 
Yet many a time I 've paused to gaze and listen. 
Till on my breath congealed the frost would 
glisten. 

These days are gone, and with them gone forever 
Are many a loved companion, friend most dear; 

As float the autumn leaves along yon river. 
One moment seen, then eddying disappear, — 

So sing the race of men: thou, in thy prime. 

Still roll'st unmarked, unmanacled by Time. 

But farewell, now, sweet stream! In after ages, 
When o'er the world Columbia sits a queen, —

SUGAR RIVER 

Sung by her poets, honored by her sages 

(An Athens without anarchy), — then seen. 
And heardy too, shall some bard, though nursed on 

mountains. 
Strike the loud harp that wakes thy triple foun- 
tains. 

Sarah Josepha Hale. 



HILLS IN MIST 

Familiar is the scene, yet strange: 
Field, roadside, tree, and stream, 

Fringed with a blur of misty change, — 
The landscape of a dream ! 

The hills are gone; the river winds 

Under a fleecy bank: 
The eye, through all its wandering, finds 

Both earth and heaven a blank. 

The picture tells a tale untrue: 

Where muffling mists descend, 
Where level meadows bound the view. 

The horizon does not end. 

For, glimpsed beyond the spectral trees. 

Faint, penciled peaks appear; 
And in this fresh, inspiring breeze 

We know the mountains near. 

Lucy Larcom.

SACO'S CRADLE 

The Dismal Pool, another deep recess. 
The Saco's cradle, where the new-born river 
Feels the first ripple o'er its surface quiver. 
And murmurs at the wild wind's harsh caress.

FRANCONIA FROM THE 
PEMIGEWASSET 

Once more, O Mountains of the North, unveil 
Your brows, and lay your cloudy mantles by ! 

And once more, ere the eyes that seek ye fail. 
Uplift against the blue walls of the sky 

Your mighty shapes, and let the sunshine weave 
Its golden net-work in your belting woods. 
Smile down in rainbows from your falling floods, 

And on your kingly brows at morn and eve 
Set crowns of fire ! So shall my soul receive 

Haply the secret of your calm and strength. 
Your unforgotten beauty interfuse 
My common life, your glorious shapes and hues 

And sun-dropped splendors at my bidding come. 
Loom vast through dreams, and stretch in bil- 
lowy length 
rom the sea-level of my lowland home! 

They rise before me ! Last night's thunder-gust 
Roared not in vain : for where its lightnings thrust 
Their tongues of fire, the great peaks seem so near, 
Burned clean of mist, so starkly bold and clear, 
( 211) 



FRANCONIA FROM PEMIGEWASSET 

I almost pause the wind in the pines to hear, 
The loose rock's fall, the steps of browsing deer. 
The clouds that shattered on yon slide-worn walls 
And splintered on the rocks their spears of rain 
Have set in play a thousand waterfalls, 
Making the dusk and silence of the woods 
Glad with the laughter of the chasing floods, 
And luminous with blown spray and silver gleams, 
While, in the vales below, the dry-lipped streams 

Sing to the freshened meadow-lands again. 
So, let me hope, the battle-storm that beats 
The land with hail and fire may pass away 
With its spent thunders at the break of day. 
Like last night's clouds, and leave, as it retreats, 
A greener earth and fairer sky behind, 
Blown crystal-clear by Freedom's Northern 
wind! 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



THE FLUME 

And farther down, from Garnsey*s lone abode. 
By a rude footpath climb the mountain side. 
Leaving below the traveller*s winding road. 
To where the cleft hill yawns abrupt and wide. 
As though some earthquake did its mass divide 
In olden time; there view the rocky Flume, 
Tremendous chasm ! rising side by side. 
The rocks abrupt wall in the long, high room, 
Echoing the wild stream's roar, and dark with 
vapory gloom. 

Harry Hibbard. 



(213 ) 



THE MERRIMACK 

Stream of my fathers! sweetly still 
The sunset rays thy valley fill; 

Breaking the dull continuous wood, 

The Merrimack rolled down his flood; 

Mingling that clear pellucid brook, 

Which channels vast Agiochook 

When spring-time's sun and shower unlock 

The frozen fountains of the rock, 

And more abundant waters given 

From that pure lake, "The Smile of Heaven," 

Tributes from vale and mountain-side, — 

With ocean's dark, eternal tide! 

John Greenleaf Whittier.

MY MOUNTAIN 

I SHUT my eyes in the snow-fall 
And dream a dream of the hills : 

The sweep of a host of mountains, 
The flash of a hundred rills; 

For a moment they crowd my vision; 

Then, moving in troops along. 
They leave me one still mountain-picture, 

The murmur of one river's song. 

*T is the musical Pemigewasset, 
That sings to the hemlock -trees 

Of the pines on the Profile Mountain, 
Of the stony Face that sees. 

Far down in the vast rock-hollows 

The waterfall of the Flume, 
The blithe cascade of the Basin, 

And the deep Pool's lonely gloom. 



All night, from the cottage-window 
I can hear the river's tune; 
(215 ) 



MY MOUNTAIN 

But the hushed air gives no answer 
Save the hemlocks' sullen rune. 

A lamb*s bleat breaks through the stillness. 
And into the heart of night. — 

Afar and around, the mountains, 
Veiled watchers, expect the light. 

Then up comes the radiant morning 

To smile on their vigils grand. 
Still muffled in cloudy mantles 

Do their stately ranges stand. 

It is not the lofty Haystacks 

Piled up by the great Notch-Gate, 

Nor the glow of the Cannon Mountain, 
That the Dawn and I await. 

To loom out of northern vapors; 

But a shadow, a pencilled line. 
That grows to an edge of opal 

Where earth-light and heaven-light shine. 

Now rose- tints bloom from the purple; 
Now the blue climbs over the green; 
( 216 ) 



MY MOUNTAIN 

Now, bright in its bath of sunshine. 
The whole grand Shape is seen. 

Is it one, or unnumbered summits, — 

The Vision so high, so fair, 
Hanging over the singing River 

In the magical depths of air? 

Ask not the name of my mountain! 

Let it rise in its grandeur lone; 
Be it one of a mighty thousand. 

Or a thousand blent in one. 

Would a name evoke new splendor 
From its wrapping and folds of light, 

Or a line of the weird rock-writing 
Make plainer to mortal sight? 

You have lived and learnt this marvel; 

That the holiest joy that came 
From its beautiful heaven to bless you. 

Nor needed nor found a name. 



Enough, on the brink of the river 
Looking up and away, to know 
(217 ) 



MY MOUNTAIN 

That the Hill loves the Pemigewasset, 
And is glad for its murmurous flow. 

Perhaps, if the Campton meadows 

Should attract your pilgrim feet 
Up the summer road to the mountains, 

You may chance my dream to meet: 

Either mine, or one more wondrous: 
Or perhaps you will look, and say 

You behold only rocks and sunshine, 
Be it dying or birth of day. 

Though you find but the stones that build it, 
I shall see through the snow-fall still. 

Hanging over the Pemigewasset, 
My glorified, dream-crowned Hill. 

Lucy Larcom. 



MARCH 

From Thk Bridal of Fenacook 

The wild March rains had fallen fast and long 
The snowy mountains of the North among, 
Making each vale a watercourse, each hill 
Bright with the cascade of some new-made rill. 

Gnawed by the sunbeams, softened by the rain. 
Heaved underneath by the swollen current's strain. 
The ice-bridge yielded, and the Merrimack 
Bore the huge ruin crashing down its track. 

John Greenleaf Whittier. 



(219) 



THE RIVER SACO 

From Agiochook's granite steeps, 

Fair Saco rolls in chainless pride, 
Rejoicing as it laughs and leaps 

Down the gray mountain's rugged side; — • 
The stern rent crags and tall dark pines 

Watch that young pilgrim flashing by. 
While close above them frowns or shines 

The black torn cloud, or deep blue sky. 

Soon gathering strength, it swiftly takes 

Through Bartlett's vales its tuneful way. 
Or hides in Conway's fragrant brakes. 

Retreating from the glare of day; — 
Now, full of vigorous life, it springs 

From the strong mountain's circling arms. 
And roams, in wide and lucid rings. 

Among green Fryeburg's woods and farms. 

Here with low voice it comes and calls 
For tribute from some hermit lake, 

And here it wildly foams and falls. 
Bidding the forest echoes wake; — 
( 220 ) 



THE RIVER SACO 

Now sweeping on it runs its race 

By mound and mill in playful glee; — 

Now welcomes, with its pure embrace. 
The vestal waves of Ossipee. 

At last, with loud and solemn roar. 

Spurning each rocky ledge and bar. 
It sinks where, on the sounding shore. 

The broad Atlantic heaves afar; — 
There, on old ocean's faithful breast. 

Its wealth of waves it proudly flings, 
And there its weary waters rest. 

Clear as they left their crystal springs. 



Sweet stream! it were a fate divine, 

Till this world's toils and tasks were done. 
To go, like those bright floods of thine. 

Refreshing all, enslaved by none, — 
To pass through scenes of calm and strife. 

Singing, like thee, with holy mirth. 
And close in peace a varied life. 

Unsullied by one stain of earth. 

James Gilborne Lyons. 



DIANA'S BATHS 

Thy course is broken here, O Woodland Stream, 
By ledges rended deep in throes of old, 
By boulders cast in figures manifold 

When Nature graved the rocks with art supreme; 

Here ever brood the shadow and the dream, 
And lofty trees their mystic branches hold 
Like sentinels above the waters cold. 

While ever shineth here the wave's soft gleam. 

Fair Dian laved in fountains in far days. 
To crystal flood revealing form divine; 

Fair Dian wandered free in woodland ways 
And heard the harmonies of stream and pine; 

Yet never on her raptured senses fell 

Sound sweeter, sight more fair, in sylvan dell. 

Frederick James Allen.

UP THE ANDROSCOGGIN 



I _ 

^^^H I behold the river rush, 

^^^K Hinting of lakes deep hidden 
^^^y In a far-off mountain hush. 

^K It flashes their mystery hither; 

^B It carries it onward — whither? 

'^^ Like the ocean-moan in the heart of a shell, 

I hear that steady monotone tell 
\^m How all great action reveals at length 

Unguessed resources of lonely strength. 

Swift traveler, hurrying river. 

Whence hast thou come to-day .^^ 
From tenantless forests of Errol, 
Green glooms of Magalloway; 
White lilies, in careless order. 
Thronged out through thy rippling border. 
And the moss-hung limbs of the aged fir 
Waved over thee weirdly, in farewell stir. 
And the old cliff-eagle screamed after thee, — 
Umbagog's wild nursling, escaped to the sea. 
( 223 ) 



UP THE ANDROSCOGGIN 

Where the foot-hills of Waumbek-Methna 

Descend to the woodlands of Maine, 
Down fliest thou, as unto thy kindred, — 
A steed with a loosened rein. 
No art may depict the fierce fashion 
The impulse, the plunge, and the passion 
Of brown waters bounding through barriers strait. 
To gaze on the solemn, crowned summits, that wait. 
Advance, then recede into distances gray. 
While, moaning and sobered, thou goest thy way. 

Beyond are the fields of Bethel, 

The meadows of perfect green. 
Where, a fugitive weary and listless, 
Thou sleepest in silvery sheen. 
But lower and less are the mountains 
That dip their rough feet in thy fountains. 
And thy onward journey, thou wilderness stream, 
Is as when one wakes from a morning dream 
Unto daily labor, while earth and air 
Grow dull with a tinge of pervading care. 

Thy song rolled clear, Androscoggin! 
Like the rune of a seer it ran; 
( 224 ) 



UP THE ANDROSCOGGIN 



^m The story and life of a river 
H| Are the life and the story of man. 

The resolve, the romantic endeavor — 
The dream that fulfills itself never — 
With freshness that urges, and full veins that boil, 
Down the hillsides of hope, over levels of toil. 
Till the Will that moves under our purpose is done. 
And the stream and the ocean have met, and are 
one! 

Lucy Larcom. 



MY MERRIMACK 



Though dew from the Franconia hills 
Into thy crystal cup distills; 
Though Winnepesaukee's ripples bright 
And Pemigewasset's placid light. 
Music of waterfall and brook. 
Are in thy voice and in thy look: 

Dearer companionship than thine. 
Friends who have made earth half divine. 
Voices that blend with thy wild birds 
And woodland flower their loving words, — 
Heart-shelter that is holy ground. 
Beside thy waters have I found.

OUR RIVER 



We know the world is rich with streams 

Renowned in song and story. 
Whose music murmurs through our dreams 

Of human love and glory : 
We know the Arno's banks are fair, 

And Rhine has castled shadows. 
And, poet-tuned, the Doon and Ayr 

Go singing down their meadows. 

But while, unpictured and unsung 

By painter or by poet. 
Our river waits the tuneful tongue 

And cunning hand to show it, — 
We only know the fond skies lean 

Above it, warm with blessing. 
And the sweet soul of our Undine 

Awakes to our caressing. 

But blue skies smile, and flowers bloom on, 
. And rivers still keep flowing, 

( 227 ) 



OUR RIVER 

The dear God still his rain and sun 

On good and ill bestowing. 
His pine-trees whisper, "Trust and wait!** 

His flowers are prophesying 
That all we dread of change or fate 

His love is underlying. 

And thou, O Mountain-born ! — no more 

We ask the wise Allotter 
Than for the firmness of thy shore. 

The calmness of thy water, 
The cheerful lights that overlay 

Thy rugged slopes with beauty. 
To match our spirits to our day 

And make a joy of duty. 

John Greenleaf Whittieb. 



MERRIMACK RIVER AT IT! 
SOURCE 

O Merrimack, strong Merrimack, 

All other streams may faint and lack. 

Exhale in clouds through dreary lands 

Or sink forlorn in desert sands; 

New Hampshire's hills and island-sea 

Are sureties for thy constancy ! 

Pemigewasset leaps from the mountains 

Where the great Stone-Face looms grand and far; 

Winnipesaukee fills at the fountains 

Ossipee guards and Chocorua — 

The sunny water that smiling lies 

With its isles like a path to Paradise; 

And where Kearsarge uplifts his shrine 

They blend their deathless floods in thine.

TO CONNECTICUT RIVER 

From that lone lake, the sweetest of the chain 
That links the mountain to the mighty main, 
Fresh from the rock and welling by the tree. 
Rushing to meet and dare and breast the sea. 
Fair, noble, glorious river! in thy wave 
The sunniest slopes and sweetest pastures lave; 
The mountain torrent, with its wintry roar. 
Springs from its home and leaps upon thy shore; 
The promontories love thee, and for this 
Turn their rough cheeks and stay thee for thy 

kiss. 
Stern, at thy source, thy northern guardians stand, 
Rude rulers of the solitary land, 
Wild dwellers by thy cold sequestered springs. 
Of earth the feathers and of air the wings; 
Their blasts have rocked thy cradle, and in storm 
Covered thy couch and swathed in snow thy 

form; 
Yet, blessed by all the elements that sweep 
The clouds above, or the unfathomed deep, 
The purest breezes scent thy blooming hills, 
The gentlest dews drop on thy eddying rills,

TO CONNECTICUT RIVER 

By the mossed bank and by the aged tree 
The silver streamlet smoothest glides to thee. 
The young oak greets thee at the water's edge. 
Wet by the wave, though anchored in the ledge. 

Thou didst not shake, thou didst not shrink, when 

late 
The mountain-top shut down its ponderous gate. 
Tumbling its tree-grown ruins to thy side. 
An avalanche of acres at a slide. 
Nor dost thou stay when winter's coldest breath 
Howls through the woods and sweeps along the 

heath, — 
One mighty sigh relieves thy icy breast, 
lAnd wakes thee from the calmness of thy rest. 

Thy noble shores! where the tall steeple shines. 
At midday, higher than thy mountain pines; 
Where the white school-house, with its daily drill 
Of sun-burnt children, smiles upon the hill; 
Where the neat village grows upon the eye. 
Decked forth in nature's sweet simplicity; 
Where hard-won competence, the farmer's wealth. 
Gains merit, honor, and gives labor health;

Where Goldsmith's self might send his exiled

THE OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE 

The mountains through the window-pane 

Showered over you their glory; 
The awkward farm-boy loved you, Jane: 

You know the old, old story. 
I never watch the sunset now 

Upon those misty ranges. 
But your bright lips, and cheek, and brow 

Gleam out of all its changes. 

I wonder if you see that chain 

On memory's dim horizon; 
There 's not a lovelier picture, Jane, 

To rest even your sweet eyes on: 
The Haystacks each an airy tent, 

The Notch a gate of splendor; 
And river, sky, and mountains blent 

In twilight radiance tender. 

I wonder, with a flitting pain, 

If thoughts of me returning, 
Are mingled with the mountains, Jane: 

I stifle down that yearning. — 
( 233 ) 



THE OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE 

A rich man's wife, on you no claim 

Have I, lost dreams to rally; 
Yet Pemigewasset sings your name 

Along its winding valley : 

And once I hoped that for us twain 

Might fall one calm life-closing; 
That Campton hills might guard us, Jane, 

In one green grave reposing. 
They say the old man's heart is rock: 

You never thought so, never ! 
And, loving you alone, I lock 

The school-house door forever!

PEMIGEWASSET CLOUD-PICTURES 

Ye clouds that float in air 

Above the farmer's labors, 
Dappling the meadows soft and fair. 

Ye are my neighbors; 
And ye bear 
The semblance of my being there. 

For I, like you, 
Am but God's breath. 

Floating across the blue 
From birth to death. 
I 've seen you white as Alpine snows. 
To his repose. 

As by the angels in a long relay, 

I *ve seen the sun by you, like Nebo's prophet, 
borne away. 

And then have turned aside to pray. 

Again, ye were to heaven a Bethel way; 
Some angel-trodden stair 
Let down mid-way in air 

Along the golden aisles of the departing day, —

A wearied human soul to greet,

THE MERRIMACK RIVER 



The Indian loved thee as a gift divine. 

To him thou flow'dst from the blest land that 

smiled 
Behind the sunset hills — the Indian heaven. 
Where, on bright plains, eternal sunshine fell, 
And bathed in gold the hills, and dells, and woods, 
Of the blest hunting-grounds. With joy he drew 
The finny stores from out thy swarming depths. 
Or floated o'er thee in his light canoe. 
And blest the kindly hand that gave him thee, 
A never-failing good; a fount of life 
And blessing to his race. And thou to him 
Didst image forth the crystal stream that flows 
From " out the throne of God and of the Lamb," 
The Christian's "water of the life divine." 
Thy source was in the spirit-peopled clouds. 
And to his untaught fancy thou didst spring 
From Manitou, the overflowing hand. 
From which all blessing comes, alike to him 
Whose teaching comes from rude, material things,

Who worships 'neath the clear blue dome of

As him who in a sculptured temple prays.

THE WHITE-THROATED SPARROW 

Hark! *t is our Northern nightingale that sings 
In far-off leafy cloisters, high and cool. 
Flinging his flute-notes bounding from the skies! 

Thou wild musician of the mountain streams. 
Most tuneful minstrel of the forest choir, 
Bird of all grace and harmony of soul, 
Unseen we hail thee for thy blissful voice. 

Up in yon tremulous mist where morning wakes 

Unnumbered shadows from their dark abodes. 

Or in the woodland glade tumultuous grown. 

With all the murmurous language of the trees. 

No blither presence fills the vocal space. 

The wandering rivulets dancing through the grass. 

The gambols, low or loud, of insect life. 

The cheerful call of cattle in the vales. 

Sweet natural sounds of the contented hours, — 

All seem more jubilant when thy song begins. 

Deep in the shade we lie and listen long; 
For human converse well may pause, and man

THE WHITE-THROATED SPARROW 

Learn from such notes fresh hints of praise 
That upward swelling from thy grateful tribe 
Circle the hills with melodies of joy. 

James Thomas Fields. 



CLIMBING TO REST 

Still must I climb, if I would rest: 
The bird soars upward to his nest; 
The young leaf on the tree-top high 
Cradles itself within the sky. 

I cannot in the valley stay: 
The great horizons stretch away! 
The very cliffs that wall me round 
Are ladders unto higher ground.

THE SACO 

From Mary Garvin 

From the heart of Waumbek Methna, from the 
lake that never fails. 

Falls the Saco in the green lap of Conway's in- 
tervales; 

There, in wild and virgin freshness, its waters foam 
and flow, 

As when Darby Field first saw them, two hundred 
years ago. 

But, vexed in all its seaward course with bridges, 
dams, and mills. 

How changed is Saco's stream, how lost its free- 
dom of the hills. 

Since travelled Jocelyn, factor Vines, and stately 
Champernoon 

Heard on its banks the gray wolf's howl, the trum- 
pet of the loon ! 

With smoking axle hot with speed, with steeds of 
fire and steam,

THE SACO 

Wide-waked To-day leaves Yesterday behind him 

like a dream. 
Still, from the hurrying train of Life, fly backward 

far and fast 
The milestones of the fathers, the landmarks of the 

past. 

But human hearts remain unchanged: the sorrow 

and the sin. 
The loves and hojjes and fears of old, are to our 

own akin; 
And if, in tales our fathers told, the songs our 

mothers sung. 
Tradition wears a snowy beard, Romance is always 

young.

CONTOOCOOK RIVER 

Of all the streams that seek the sea 
By mountain pass, or sunny lea. 
Now where is one that dares to vie 
With clear Contoocook, swift and shy? 
Monadnock's child, of snow-drifts born. 
The snows of many a winter morn 
And many a midnight, dark and still. 
Heaped higher, whiter, day by day. 
To melt, at last, with suns of May, 
And steal, in tiny fall and rill, 
Down the long slopes of granite gray; 
Or filter slow through seam and cleft 
When frost and storm the rock have reft. 
To bubble cool in sheltered springs 
Where the lone red-bird dips his wings, 
And the tired fox that gains their brink 
Stoops, safe from hound and horn, to drink. 
And rills and springs, grown broad and deep. 
Unite through gorge and glen to sweep

CONTOOCOOK RIVER 

In roaring brooks that turn and take 
The over-floods of pool and lake. 
Till, to the fields, the hills deliver 
Contoocook's bright and brimming river! 

O have you seen from Hillsboro' town 
How fast its tide goes hurrying down. 
With rapids now, and now a leap 
Past giant boulders, black and steep, 
Plunged in mid water, fain to keep 
Its current from the meadows green? 
But, flecked with foam, it speeds along; 
And not the birch-tree*s silvery sheen. 
Nor the soft lull of murmuring pines. 
Nor hermit thrushes, fluting low. 
Nor ferns, nor cardinal flowers that glow 
Where clematis, the fairy, twines. 
Nor bowerj' islands where the breeze 
Forever whispers to the trees. 
Can stay its course, or still its song; 
Ceaseless it flows till, round its bed. 
The vales of Henniker are spread. 
Their banks all set with golden grain, 
Or stately trees whose vistas gleam —

Plunged in mid water, fain to keep 
Its current from the meadows green? 
But, flecked with foam, it speeds along; 
And not the birch-tree's silvery sheen. 
Nor the soft lull of murmuring pines. 
Nor hermit thrushes, fluting low. 
Nor ferns, nor cardinal flowers that glow 
Where clematis, the fairy, twines. 
Nor bowery islands where the breeze 
Forever whispers to the trees. 
Can stay its course, or still its song; 
Ceaseless it flows till, round its bed. 
The vales of Henniker are spread, 
Their banks all set with golden grain. 
Or stately trees whose vistas gleam —

CONTOOCOOK RIVER 

A double forest — in the stream; 

And winding *neath the pine-crowned hill 

That overhangs the village plain. 

By sunny reaches, broad and still. 

It nears the bridge that spans its tide, — 

The bridge whose arches low and wide 

It ripples through, — and should you lean 

A moment there, no lovelier scene 

On England's Wye, or Scotland's Tay, 

Would charm your gaze, a summer's day. 

O of what beauty 't is the giver — 

Contoocook's bright and brimming river! 

And on it glides, by grove and glen. 
Dark woodlands, and the homes of men. 
With calm and meadow, fall and mill; 
Till, deep and clear, its waters fill 
The channels round that gem of isles 
Sacred to captives' woes and wiles. 
And eager half, half eddying back. 
Blend with the lordly Merrimack; 
And Merrimack whose tide is strong 
Rolls gently, with its waves along, 
Monadnock's stream that, coy and fair, 
( 246) 



CONTOOCOOK RIVER 

Has come, its larger life to share. 
And to the sea doth safe deliver 
Contoocook's bright and brimming river. 

Edna Dean Proctor. 



THE FALLS OF THE SACO 

From MoGG Megone 

Who stands on that cliff, like a figure of stone, 
Unmoving and tall in the light of the sky. 
Where the spray of the cataract sparkles on high. 
Lonely and sternly, save Mogg Megone? 
Close to the verge of the rock is he. 

While beneath him the Saco its work is doing. 
Hurrying down to its grave, the sea. 

And slow through the rock its pathway hewing ! 
Far down, through the mist of the falling river, 
Which rises up like an incense ever, 
The splintered points of the crags are seen. 
With water howling and vexed between. 
While the scooping whirl of the pool beneath 
Seems an open throat, with its granite teeth! 

John Greenleaf Whittier.

REVISITED 



Sing soft, sing low, our lowland river. 
Under thy banks of laurel bloom; 

Softly and sweet, as the hour beseemeth, 
Sing us the songs of peace and home. 

Bring us the airs of hills and forests. 
The sweet aroma of birch and pine, 

Give us a waft of the north-wind laden 
With sweetbrier odors and breath of kine! 

Bring us the purple of mountain sunsets. 
Shadows of clouds that rake the hills, 

The green repose of thy Plymouth meadows. 
The gleam and ripple of Campton rills. 

Lead us away in shadow and sunshine. 
Slaves of fancy, through all thy miles. 

The winding ways of Pemigewasset, 
And Winnipesaukee*s hundred isles. 

Shatter in sunshine over thy ledges. 
Laugh in thy plunges from fall to fall; 
( 249 ) 



REVISITED 

Play with thy fringes of elms, and darken 
Under the shade of the mountain wall. 

The cradle-song of thy hillside fountains 
Here in thy glory and strength repeat; 

Give us a taste of thy upland music, 
Show us the dance of thy silver feet. 

Into thy dutiful life of uses 

Pour the music and weave the flowers: 
With the song of birds and bloom of meadows 

Lighten and gladden thy heart and ours. 

For though by the Master's feet untrodden. 
Though never His word has stilled thy waves. 

Well for us may thy shores be holy, 

With Christian altars and saintly graves. 

And well may we own thy hint and token 
Of fairer valleys and streams than these, 

Where the rivers of God are full of water. 
And full of sap are His healing trees! 

John Greenleaf Whittieb. 



CONNECTICUT RIVER 



r 

^B Fair river! not unknown to classic song, 
^H Which still in varying beauty roll'st along, 
^m Where first thy infant fount is faintly seen, 
^B A line of silver *mid a fringe of green; 
^^ Or where near towering rocks thy bolder tide. 
To win the giant-guarded pass, doth glide; 

The farmer, here, with honest pleasure sees 
His orchards blushing to the fervid breeze. 
His bleating flocks the shearer's care that need. 
His waving woods the wintry hearth that feed. 
His hardy steers that break the yielding soil, 
His patient sons who aid their father's toil. 
The ripening fields for joyous harvest drest. 
And the white spire that points a world of rest. 

Lydla Huntley Sigourney.

SONGO RIVER 

Nowhere such a devious stream, 
Save in fancy or in dream, 
Winding slow through brush and brake. 
Links together lake and lake. 

Walled with woods or sandy shelf. 
Ever doubling on itself 
Flows the stream, so still and slow, 
That it hardly seems to flow. 

Never errant knight of old, 
Lost in woodland or on wold. 
Such a winding path pursued 
Through the sylvan solitude. 

Never school-boy, in his quest 
After hazel-nut or nest. 
Through the forest in and out 
Wandered loitering thus about. 

In the mirror of its tide 
Tangled thickets on each side 
( 252 ) 



SONGO RIVER 

Hang inverted, and between 
Floating cloud or sky serene. 

Swift or swallow on the wing 
Seems the only living thing, 
Or the loon, that laughs and flies 
Down to those reflected skies. 

Silent stream ! thy Indian name 
Unfamiliar is to fame; 
For thou hidest here alone, 
Well content to be unknown. 

But thy tranquil waters teach 
Wisdom deep as human speech, 
Moving without haste or noise 
In unbroken equipoise. 

Though thou tumest no busy mill. 
And art ever calm and still. 
Even the silence seems to say 
To the traveller on his way : — 

'Traveller, hurrying from the heat 
Of the city, stay thy feet! 
( 253 ) 



SONGO RIVER 

Kest awhile, nor longer waste 
Life with inconsiderate haste! 

"Be not like a stream that brawls 
Loud with shallow waterfalls, 
But in quiet self-control 
Link together soul and soul." 

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 



OUTSPURS 



Again among the hills! 
The jubilant unbroken 
Long dreaming of the hills!

LONGING 



i 

^^B O SET me free ! The flower-starred meadows woo, 
^^1 The blithe winds call, the birds cry, "Come, O 
^^K come!" 

^V The brooklet's laughter, all the busy hum 
^" Of insect-life — the fragrance stealing through 
My wide-flung casement, white doves' murmuring 
coo, 
All fain would draw me forth! Alas! so dumb 
I cannot answer them — but count the sum 
Of their delights, and hate my bonds anew ! 

O set me free! The fields and winds and flowers 

Are lonely for their playmate; and the hills 
Miss my light foot, that chased the sunny hours 
Down westward slopes, fleet rival of the rills ! 
O set me free to seek the forest bowers 

Where Nature's mother-clasp my every longing 
stills.

MONADNOCK 

Thousand minstrels woke within me, 
"Our music 's in the hills;" — 
Gayest pictures rose to win me. 
Leopard-colored rills. 
'*Up! — If thou knew'st who calls 
To twilight parks of beech and pine. 
High over the river intervals. 
Above the ploughman's highest line, 
Over the owner's farthest walls ! 
Up ! where the airy citadel 
O'erlooks the surging landscape's swell ! 
Let not unto the stones the Day 
Her lily and rose, her sea and land display. 
Read the celestial sign! 
Lo! the south answers to the north; 
Bookworm, break this sloth urbane; 
A greater spirit bids thee forth 
Than the gray dreams which thee detain. 
Mark how the climbing Oreads 
Beckon thee to their arcades; 
Youth, for a moment free as they. 
Teach thy feet to feel the ground,

. ..en Time thy feet has bound 
Take the bounty of thy birth, 
Taste the lordship of the earth." 



I heard, and I obeyed, — 
Assured that he who made the claim. 
Well known, but loving not a name, 

Was not to be gainsaid. 
Ere yet the summoning voice was still, 
I turned to Cheshire's haughty hill. 
From the fixed cone the cloud-rack flowed 
Like ample banner flung abroad 
To all the dwellers in the plains 
Round about, a hundred miles. 
With salutations to the sea and to the bordering 

isles. 
In his own loom's garment dressed. 
By his proper bounty blessed. 
Fast abides this constant giver. 
Pouring many a cheerful river; 
To far eyes, an aerial isle 
Unploughed, which finer spirits pile. 
Which morn and crimson evening paint ) 
( 259 ) 



MONADNOCK 

For bard, for lover and for saint; 
An eyemark and the country's core, 
Inspirer, prophet evermore; 
Pillar which God aloft had set 
So that men might it not forget; 
It should be their life's ornament, 
And mix itself with each event; 
Gauge and calendar and dial. 
Weatherglass and chemic phial, 
Garden of berries, perch of birds. 
Pasture of pool-haunting herds, 
Graced by each change of sum untold. 
Earth-baking heat, stone-cleaving coldo 

On the summit as I stood, 
O'er the floor of plain and flood 
Seemed to me, the towering hill 
Was not altogether still, 
But a quiet sense conveyed: 
If I err not, thus it said: — 

* Many feet in summer seek. 
Oft, my far-appearing peak; 
In the dreaded winter-time, 
( 260 ) 



MONADNOCK 

None save dappling shadows climb. 
Under clouds, my lonely head. 
Old as the sun, old almost as the shade; 
And comest thou 

To see strange forests and new snow. 
And tread uplifted land? 
And leavest thou thy lowland race. 
Here amid clouds to stand? 
And wouldst be my companion 
Where I gaze, and still shall gaze, 
Through tempering nights and flashing days. 
When forests fall, and man is gone. 
Over tribes and over times. 
At the burning Lyre, 
Nearing me. 

With its stars of northern fire. 
In many a thousand years? 
• ••••••• 

*Monadnock is a mountain strong. 
Tall and good my kind among; 
But well I know, no mountain can, 
Zion or Meru, measure with man. 
For it is on zodiacs writ, 
Adamant is soft to wit: 
( 261 ) 



MONADNOCK 

And when the greater comes again 
With my secret in his brain, 
I shall pass, as glides my shadow 
Daily over hill and meadow. 

'Through all time, in light, in gloom 
Well I hear the approaching feet 
On the flinty pathway beat 
Of him that cometh, and shall come; 
Of him who shall as lightly bear 
My daily load of woods and streams, 
As doth this round sky-clea,ving boat 
Which never strains its rocky beams; 
Whose timbers, as they silent float, 
Alps and Caucasus uprear, 
And the long Alleghanies here. 
And all town-sprinkled lands that be. 
Sailing through stars with all their history. 

Every morn I lift my head, 
See New England underspread, 
South from Saint Lawrence to the Sound, 
From Katskill east to the sea-bound. 
Anchored fast for many an age, 
( 262 ) 



MONADNOCK 

I await the bard and sage. 

Who, in large thoughts, like fair pearl-seed, 

Shall string Monadnock like a bead. 

He comes, but not of that race bred 
Who daily climb my specular head. 
Oft as morning wreathes my scarf. 
Fled the last plumule of the Dark, 
Pants up hither the spruce clerk 
From South Cove and City Wharf. 
I take him up my rugged sides. 
Half-repentant, scant of breath, — 
Bead-eyes my granite chaos show. 
And my midsummer snow: 
Open the daunting map beneath, — 
All his county, sea and land. 
Dwarfed to measure of his hand; 
His day's ride is a furlong space. 
His city-tops a glimmering haze. 
I plant his eyes on the sky-hoop bounding; 
* See there the grim gray rounding 
Of the bullet of the earth 
Whereon ye sail, 
Tumbling steep 

( 263 ) 



MONADNOCK 

In the uncontinented deep/ 

He looks on that, and he turns pale. 

'T is even so, this treacherous kite, 

Farm-furrowed, town-incrusted sphere. 

Thoughtless of its anxious freight, 

Plunges eyeless on forever; 

And he, poor parasite. 

Cooped in a ship he cannot steer, — 

Who is the captain he knows not. 

Port or pilot trows not, — 

Risk or ruin he must share. 

I scowl on him with my cloud, 

With my north wind chill his blood; 

I lame him, clattering down the rocks; 

And to live he is in fear. 

Then, at last, I let him down 

Once more into his dapper town, 

To chatter, frightened, to his clan 

And forget me if he can." 

Ralph Waldo Emerson. 




THE DISTANT RANGE 



They beckon from their sunset domes afar. 
Light's royal priesthood, the eternal hills : 

Though born of earth, robed of the sky they are; 
And the anointing radiance heaven distills 
On their high brows, the air with glory fills. 

The portals of the west are opened wide; 
And lifted up, absolved from earthly ills, 

All thoughts, a reverent throng, to worship glide. 
The hills interpret heavenly mysteries. 

The mysteries of Light — an open book 
Of Revelation : see, its leaves unfold 
With crimson borderings, and lines of gold. 

Where the rapt reader, though soul-deep his look. 

Dreams of a glory deeper than he sees!

THE CALL OF THE COUNTRY » 

O, YOU left her arms so early, lusting for the hurly- 
burly 
Of the huge, grim, grinning town; 
But the wander-fever died, and your weary spirit 
cried. 
Where the love of Earth, the Mother, hunts us 
down; 
Where the ledgers lay so high that they hurt the 
aching eye, 
While the worried brain toiled without rest, 
O, then the Country called you, and her dear old 
sights enthralled you. 
And you longed to weep once more upon her 
breast. 
Don't you hear the voice from afar, dear boy. 

Hear it wherever you roam? — 
Loud on your track, *' Come back, come back. 
Back to the hills of home!'* 

Where the mocking whistles bluster, and the mon- 
strous chimneys cluster,

THE CALL OF THE COUNTRY 



f 

If ^°^ *^^ ™^^ looms curse and brawl. 

Where the human torrent pours, weak and wretched 
from the doors. 
Don't you hear again the patient Mother call? 
There's a whisper in your ear of the sounds that 
once were dear — 
Browsing cattle, barking dogs, bragging cocks; 
O, the hungry horses neighing, O, the odors of the 
haying, 
O, the company and comfort of the flocks! 
Yes, you hear the voice where the city roars 

Through its narrow banks and high, 
Wherever you roam, "Come home, come 
home. 
Home to my arms to die!" 



Through the haste and fret of trade comes the 
dream that cannot fade. 
Of the never-laboring leisure of the ox, 
Of the purple shadows deep, basking on the roofs 
asleep, 
Of the permanence and patience of the rocks ! 
Boy, forget the blistering street where the flag- 
gings burn your feet; 
( 267 ) 



THE CALL OF THE COUNTRY 

Boy, forget the ugly trolley's vulgar song; 
Still remains the land of wonder, — blue skies 
over, green earth under, 
Where the fainting soul again grows swift and 
strong; 
Still comes the cry of the Long Ago, 
Of the Far-away-in-the-Past, 
" Here be your rest, my breast, my breast. 
Back on my breast at last!"

RUMNEY HILLS 

The rippling rills from Rumney Hills 

Flow down to Baker's river, 
And how my heart with rapture thrills 

To see them flash and quiver; 
For there, along those bonny banks, 

Beside those sparkling waters, 
The maiden walked who won my love. 

The flower of Grafton*s daughters. 

How proudly stand the mountains grand 

On Rumney*s rocky border. 
Upheaved by the Creator's hand 

In eloquent disorder; 
But beauty dwells in all the dells. 

And e'en the mountains hoary 
Give lessons of the power of God, 

And glimpses of his glory. 

There cradled, lived the girl who came 
To bless my lowland dwelling; 

How much I love the brave old place 
My words arc weak in telling. 
( 209 ) 



RUMNEY HILLS 

But like a picture of the bright 

Elysian lands of story, 
The halo of a deathless love. 

Surrounds it with its glory.

AN INVITATION 



The warm wide hills are miLfl3ed thick with green. 
And fluttering swallows fill the air with song. 
Come to our cottage-home. Lowly it stands, 
Set in a vale of flowers, deep fringed with grass. 
The sweet-brier (noiseless herald of the place) 
Flies with its odor, meeting all who roam 
With welcome footsteps to our small abode. 
No splendid cares live here, — no barren shows. 
The bee makes harbor at our perfumed door. 
And hums all day his breezy note of joy. 

Come, O my friend! and share our festal month. 
And while the west wind walks the leafy woods. 
While orchard-blooms are white in all the lanes, 
And brooks make music in the deep cool dells, 
Enjoy the golden moments as they pass. 
And gain new strength for days that are to come. 
James Thomas Fields.

MOUNT MORIAH FROM BETHEL 

The mountains, gazed at from afar. 
Take shape of our imaginings; 

Outspread beyond this valley are 
A lifted pair of purple wings, 

That bear my thoughts away, away, 

I know not whither, day by day. 

Behind them, two gray pyramids 
Cut sharp and deep the western sky. 

With one pale summit, that forbids 
His brother peaks to climb too high. 

Because he will have mate nor peer 

His lonely tryst with heaven to hear. 

These are the heights that crown the land; 

Step after step, their slopes descend 
Out of the clouds, a stairway grand, 

Until with common earth they blend. 
Where the broad meadow spreads before 
Their bases, like an emerald floor. 
( 272 ) 



MOUNT MORIAH FROM BETHEL 

The men who tilled these fields of old, 
Called the place Bethel : well might seem 

That mountain stairway to unfold 
The ladder set in Jacob's dream; 

And the wide pinions outlined there. 

An angel's, winnowing the air. 

The farther summits proudly oft 

Retreat in clouds, and mist, and rain. 

Leaving those great wings poised aloft: 
Forward they bend, with steadfast strain,, 

As if to bear on through the sky 

Some burden of glad mystery. 

And sometimes of their shape is left. 
Only one vigorous, broken line. 

Half hidden by a vapory weft; 
The dim sketch of a grand design. 

Whose veiled proportions still suggest 

Motion and strength, upheld in rest. 

My fancy often paints a Face, 
Benign with majesty and light, 

Looking out midway through the space 
Where the wings part for onward flight: / 
( 273 ) 




MOUNT MORIAH FROM BETHEL 

Oh, wondrous beyond mortal guess 
Is that elusive loveliness ! 

Yet vainly imagery of mine 

Dreams its faint picture of the Love 

That hovers, with a warmth divine, 
These human lives of ours above. 

And from the hardships of our lot 

Uplifts us, when we know it not. 

Out of the very ground we tread 

Visions of heavenly hope arise. 
God made the earth; it is not dead; 

It shares the glory of the skies : 
Look! even in vague, half-shapen things 
A soul is struggling up for wings! 

Lucy Larcom. 



THE VILLAGE LIGHTS 

Only a little village street, 

Lying along a mountain's side; 
Only the silences which meet 
When weary hands and weary feet 

By night's sweet rest are satisfied; 
Only the dark of summer nights; 
Only the commonest of sights, 
The glimmer of the village lights ! 

I know not, then, why it should bring 

Into my eyes such sudden tears. 
But to the mountain's sheltering 
The little village seems to cling, 
As child, all unaware of fears, 
Unconscious that it is caressed, 
In perfect peace and perfect rest 
Asleep upon its mother's breast. 



No stir, no sound! The shadows creep. 
The old and young, in common trust. 
Are lying down to wait, asleep, 
( 275 ) 



THE VILLAGE LIGHTS 

While Life and Joy will come to keep 

With Death and Pain what tryst they must. 
O faith ! for faith almost too great ! 
Come slow, O day of evil freight ! 
O village hearts, sleep well, sleep late! 

Helen Hunt Jackson. 



I 



UP TO THE HILLS 

From tame and level lowlands, 

From the restless, restless sea, 
My spirit reaches upward, 

Calm mountain land, to thee! 

Through the woodlands, through the farm- 
lands, 

I speed — yet all too slow; 
And the rivers flow to meet me, 

Flow to greet me, as I go. 

Now green hills are beginning 

To rise on every side; 
And distant, beckoning summits 

Glance shyly, and then hide. 

Now they are all about me. 

In their very arms I stand; 
Their strength, their peace, their beauty. 

Fold me on every hand. 

For me they have been waiting. 
Patient, unchanging, true; 

( 277 ) . 



UP TO THE HILLS 

Through all the long year's absence 
My faithful heart they knew. 

How on their tranquil faces. 

Immobile as they seem. 
The loving eye still traces 

The shifting thought and dream, — 

Their sunny smile's enchantment. 
Their sad cheeks' mournful curve. 

Their glowing, breathing rapture. 
Their secret, dark reserve ! 

How noble is their friendship ! 

They hold my freedom dear; 
They encircle and they guard me. 

Yet they will not come too near!

KEARSARGE 



O LIFT thy head, thou mountain lone. 

And mate thee with the sun ! 
The rosy clouds are valeward blown. 
Thy stars, that near at midnight shone. 

Gone heavenward one by one, 
And half of earth, and half of air. 
Thou risest vast and gray and bare 

And crowned with glory. Far southwest 

Monadnock thrills to see. 
For all its trees and towering crest 
And clear Contoocook from its breast 

Poured down for wood and lea. 
How statelier still, through frost and dew. 
Thy granite cleaves the distant blue. 

And high to north, from fainter sky, 

Franconia's cliffs look down; 
Home to their crags the eagles fly. 
Deep in their caves the echoes die. 

The sparkling waters frown. 
And the Great Face that guards the glen 
Pales with the pride of mortal men.

KEARSARGE 

Nay, from their silent, crystal seat 
The White Hills scan the plain; 

Nor Saco's leaping, lightsome feet. 

Nor Ammonoosuc, wild to greet 
The meadows and the main, 

Nor snows nor thunders can atone 

For splendor thou hast made thine own. 

For thou hast joined the immortal band 
Of hills and streams and plains 

Shrined in the songs of native land, — 

Linked with the deeds of valor grand 
Told when the bright day wanes, — 

Part of the nation's life art thou, 

O mountain of the granite brow! 

Not Pelion when the Argo rose, 

Grace of its goodliest trees; 
Nor Norway hills when woodmen's blows 
Their pines sent crashing through the snows 

That kings might rove the seas; 
Nor heights that gave the Armada's line. 
Thrilled with a joy so pure as thine. 

( 280 ) 




KEARSARGE 

Bold was the ship thy name that bore; 

Strength of the hills was hers; 
Heart of the oaks thy pastures store, 
The pines that hear the north wind roar, 

The dark and tapering firs; 
Nor Argonaut nor Viking knew 
Sublimer daring than her crew. 

And long as Freedom fires the soul 

Or mountains pierce the air, 
Her fame shall shine on honor's scroll; 
Thy brow shall be the pilgrim's goal 

Uplifted broad and fair; 
And, from thy skies, inspiring gales 
O'er future seas shall sweep our sails. 

Still summer keep thy pastures green. 

And clothe thy oaks and pines; 
Brooks laugh thy rifted rocks between; 
Snows fall serenely o'er the scene 

And veil thy lofty lines; 
While crowned and peerless thou dost stand. 
The monarch of our mountain-land. 

Edna Dean Ppoctor. 



CROW'S NEST 

Building our beacon fire, we spread our feast 
On the bare cliff high up against the sky; 
Eastward a few lone clouds went sailing by, 

As more and more the sunset glow increased, 

And every sound of bird and leaf had ceased; 
Far down below, we could the stream espy. 
Seeming at rest all motionless to lie; 

And life from every burden seemed released. 

Range beyond range, we saw the wooded heights; 
And far away, backed against paly gold, 

Their rightful lords — unspeakable delights! — 
Their purple splendor sturdily uphold, 

While climbing slow, the moon and eve 's first star 

Led every thought to heights more cool and far. 
John White Chadwick.

ON THE LEDGE 

Restored unto life by the sun and the breeze! 
Rich balsams float down from the resinous trees. 
Stirring into quick health every pulse of the air: 
Released once again from imprisoning care. 
At the gate of green pastures my soul lieth free. 
And to go in or out is refreshment to me. 

Lo, yonder is Paradise! Softly below. 

The river that watereth Eden doth flow ! 

I behold, through blue gaps in the mountainous 

west, 
Height ascending on height, the abodes of the blest: 
And I cannot tell whether to climb were more 

sweet 
Than to lap me in beauty spread out at my feet. 

There sways a white cloud on yon loftiest peak, 
A wind from beyond it is fanning my cheek; 
Through the oak and the birch glides a musical 

shiver, 
A ripple just silvers the dusk of the river. 
( 283 ) 



ON THE LEDGE 

— Though I may not know how, each is part of 

the whole 
Perfect flood-tide of peace that is brimming my 

soul. 

Here is shelter and outlook, deep rest and wide 

room; 
The pine woods behind, breathing balm out of 

gloom ; 
Before, the great hills over vast levels lean, — 
A glory of purple, a splendor of green. 
As a new earth and heaven, ye are mine once again. 
Ye beautiful meadows and mountains of Maine !

Of a sweet picture, and of her who led, 
A fitting guide, with reverential tread. 
Into that mountain m^^stery. First a lake 
Tinted with sunset; next the wavy lines ^ 

Of far receding hills; and yet more far,

His rosy forehead to the evening star.

THE FAREWELL 

Now ends the hour's communion, near and high; 

We have heard whispers from the mountain's 
heart, 
And Hfe henceforth is nobler. With a sigh 

Of grateful sadness, let us now depart, 

And seek our lower levels. Rills that start 
From this Hill's bosom, there reflect the sky. 

And his deep shadows greener grace impart 
To the sweet fields which low beneath him lie. 

One farewell glance from far. The hills are fled ! 
Hid in the folds of yon funereal cloud ! 
A moment leans the Loftiest from his shroud : — 

"Our thunders purify the vales," he saith: 
" 'T is not alone by smiles that life is fed : 

Awe fills the sanctuary of deep faith." 

Lucy Larcom.

RETURN TO THE HILLS 



Like a music of triumph and joy 

Sounds the roll of the wheels, 
And the breath of the engine laughs out 

In loud chuckles and peals, 
Like the laugh of a man that is glad 

Coming homeward at night; 
I lean out of the window and nod 

To the left and the right. 
To my friends in the fields and the woods; 

Not a face do I miss; 
The sweet asters and browned golden-rod. 

And that stray clematis, 
Of all vagabonds dearest and best. 

In most seedy estate; 
I am sure they all recognize me; 

If I only could wait, 
I should hear all the welcome which now 

In their faces I read, 
"O true lover of us and our kin. 

We all bid thee God speed!" 

O my mountains, no wisdom can teach 
Me to think that ye care 
( 287 ) 



RETURN TO THE HILLS 

Nothing more for my steps than the rest. 

Or that they can have share 
Such as mine in your royal crown-lands. 

Unencumbered of fee; 
In your temples with altars unhewn. 

Where redemption is free; 
In your houses of treasure, which gold 

Cannot buy if it seek; 
And your oracles, mystic with words. 

Which men lose if they speak! 

Ah ! with boldness of lovers who wed 

I make haste to thy feet, 
And as constant as lovers who die. 

My surrender repeat; 
And I take as the right of my love 

And I keep as its sign, 
An ineflFable joy in each sense 

And new strength as from wine, 
A seal for all purpose and hope. 

And a pledge of full light, 
Like a pillar of cloud for my day 

And of fire for my night. 

Helen Hunt Jackson. 



THOMPSON'S GROVE 

The traffic of the busy world goes by. 
The horse of iron daily thunders past 
Upon his endless round, from ocean vast 

Unto the kingly hills, from mountains high 

Down to the shore where princely cities lie. 
Stern industry while human need shall last 
Upon the primal world her spell shall cast, 

And rear her banners 'neath the holy sky. 

Sweet Grove, where man may come and refuge 
find, 
The sacred silences shall hush the pain 

That broodeth in the breast; thy spirit, old 
As nature, new as morn, shall touch the mind 
With influence Lethean : here, come loss or gain, 
Earth's rarest visions shall my heart behold. 
Frederick James Allen.

DAYS ON MONADNOCK 

And great those days 
And splendid on the hills, when the wild winds 
Forever sweep the clouds, — at once re-formed. 
From off the plateau's slope, — and at a breath 
Up start the sunlit valleys sweet with morn, — 
The hamlet's homely grange, the dappled shades 
Thrown from the sultry clouds that sail its heaven; 
And in a second instant the wild mists 
Instantly obscure; the valley vanishes, — 
Gone as a flitting vision from the skies. 

Poised in my airy pinnacle, I see 

(The dainty swallow whirring swiftly by) 

At dizzy depths, far in the valley's womb. 

Through zigzag coil of alders, a black thread. 

The serpentine progression of a stream, 

Playing its rival flute-notes all the year; 

See the herds feeding on the tiresome hills, — 

Enormous to the herdsmen, — and to me 

As flat and motionless as I to them 

Obliterate. 

William Ellery Channing. 
( 290 ) 



THE BELLS OF BETHLEHEM 

How sweet the chimes this Sunday morn, 

*Mid autumn's requiem. 
Across the mountain valleys borne, — 
The bells of Bethlehem! 
"Come join with us,'* they seem to say, 
"And celebrate this hallowed day!" 

Our hearts leap up with glad accord — 

Judea's Bethlehem strain. 
That once ascended to the Lord, 

Floats back to earth again. 
And round our hills the echoes swell 
To "God with us, Emmanuel!" 

O Power Divine, that led the star 

To Mary's sinless child! 
O ray from heaven that beamed afar 

And o'er his cradle smiled ! 
Help us to worship now with them 
Who hailed the Christ at Bethlehem. 

James Thomas Fields. 



( 291 ) 



MONADNOCK 

The merest bulge above the horizon's rim 

Of purplish blue, which you might think a cloud 
Low lying there, — that is Monadnock proud. 
Full seventy miles away. But far and dim 
Although it be, I still can without glass 
Descry, as I were standing happy there 
Upon the topmost ledges gray and bare, 
Something which with the shadows will not pass, — 
A vision that abides : a fair young girl 
Lying her length; her hair all disarrayed 

By the bold mountain wind; her cheeks aglow; 
As if that rocky summit should unfurl 
A rose of June ! And what if I had said, 
"Thrice fair Monadnock with her lying so!'* 
John White Chadwick.

BURNS HILL 



I 



fTuE j-ears have flown since then. 

The busy hands of men 
Have torn the woods and fettered all the streams; 

Yet still in the sunset's glow 

The lake smiles from below, 
And in the west the mountain monarch gleams. 

The churchyard now is old. 

Its sacred bounds now hold 
The dust of all that little band of yore; 

The stones are black with moss, 

The tangled bushes cross 
Above the maiden's grave and block the door. 

Yet in this northern land, 
Amid these mountains grand, 
I know no spot more beautiful, more bright; 
No spot more fit to keep 
The dead in their long sleep 
Till Resurrection Morn shall banish night. 

Fred Lewis Pattee. 
( 293 ) 



MONADNOCK IN OCTOBER 

Uprose Monadnock in the northern blue. 
A glorious minster builded to the Lord ! 
The setting sun his crimson radiance threw 
On crest, and steep, and wood, and valley sward, 
Blending their myriad hues in rich accord. 
Till, like the wall of heaven, it towered to view. 
Along its slope, where russet ferns were strewn 
And purple heaths, the scarlet maples flamed, 
And reddening oaks and golden birches shone, — 
Resplendent oriels in the black pines framed. 
The pines that climb to woo the winds alone. 
And down its cloisters blew the evening breeze, 
Through courts and aisles ablaze with autumn 

bloom. 
Till shrine and portal thrilled to harmonies 
Now soaring, dying now in glade and gloom. 
And with the wind was heard the voice of 

streams, — 
Constant their Aves and Te Deums be, — 
Lone Ashuelot murmuring down the lea, 
And brooks that haste where shy Contoocook 

gleams 

( 294 ) 



w 

K MONADNOCK IN OCTOBER 

Through groves and meadows, broadening to the 

sea. 
Then holy twilight fell on earth and air. 
Above the dome the stars hung faint and fair. 
And the great minster hushed its shrines in prayer; 
While all the lesser heights kept watch and ward 

H About Monadnock builded to the Lord ! 

B Edna Dean Pboctor. 



FROM THE HILLS 

From white brows flushed with heavenly morning- 
red. 

From faces beautiful with prophecy 

Of the sun-gospel a new day shall see, 
From cloud-wrapt shape and light-anointed head. 
Out of whose gracious mystery words are said 

That wake abysmal voices, and set free 

Reverberations of eternity, 
Down to the level ocean are we sped, 
Where broken tints in wide illusion blend, 

And all sounds gather into monotone. 

Always unto great seers have mountains shown 
Their Founder and Uprearer as man's friend. 

The hills are a religion; but the sea, 

O Truth, is Doubt's unanswered moan. to thee! 

Lucy Larcom.

MOUNT PLEASANT 



'T WAS a glorious scene, — the mountain height 
Aflame with sunset's colored light. 

Even the black pines, grim and old, 
Transfigured stood with crowns of gold. 

There on a hoary crag we stood 
When the tide of gloiy was at its flood. 

Close by our feet, the mountain's child. 
The delicate harebell, sweetly smiled. 

Lifting its cups of tender blue 

From seam and rift where the mosses grew. 

The everlasting's mimic snow 
Whitened the dry, crisp grass below; 

WTiile the yellow flames of golden-rod 
Through clumps of starry asters glowed, 

And the sumac's ruddy fires burned through 
Tangled hazels of tawny hue. 
( 297 ) 



MOUNT PLEASANT 

Below stretched wide the skirt of wood 

Where the maple's green was dashed with blood; 

Where the beech had donned a golden brown. 
And the ash was sad in a purple gown, 

And the straight birch stems gleamed white be- 
tween 
The sombre spruces, darkly green. 

Clasping the mountain's very feet, 
The small lake lay, a picture-sheet, 

Where the pomp of sunset cloud and shine 
Glowed in a setting of dark old pine. 

Far in the west blue peaks arose, — 
One with a crest of glittering snows, — 

With hill and valley and wood between. 
And lakes transfused with the sunset sheen. 

Rose Sanborn.

CARDIGAN 

Hast ever stood upon the wind-swept peak 
Of Cardigan and looked adown the rocks? 
Sheer off they make one bold and mighty leap. 
And one in midair may look down and see 
The ragged ledge and tops of mighty trees 
Within the ancient forest far below, 
While on the brink a few storm-dwarfed shrubs 
Stretch out their arms in pity to the blast, 
.And clutch for life the crevice of the rock. 

Fred Lewis Pattee.

THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS 

A MIDNIGHT hush pervadcs the air, 
No birdhng chirps, no leaflet stirs; 

Midsummer heat is everywhere, 
Even among the firs. 

What far-off sound grows on the ear? 

Through wild ravines it sweeps along. 
As if some swift-winged bird drew near 

To wake the night with song. 

A rustle fills the birches tall; 

A sudden coolness fans the cheek: 
Monadnock's breath bears life to all 

Beneath his rugged peak. 

For here each day is born anew, 

A chaste Diana, fresh and fair. 
Whose arrows, dipped in forest dew, 

Transfix each worldly care. 

Mary Thacher Higginson. 



( 300 ) 



MONADNOCK 

Upon the far-off mountain's brow 

The angry storm has ceased to beat. 
And broken clouds are gathering now, 

In lowly reverence round his feet. 
I saw their dark and crowded bands 

On his firm head in wrath descending. 
But there once more redeemed he stands. 

And heaven's clear arch is o'er him bending. 

I *ve seen him when the rising sun 

Shone like a watch-fire on the height; 
I 've seen him when the day was done, 

Bathed in the evening's crimson light! 
I've seen him in the midnight hour. 

When all the world beneath were sleeping, 
Like some lone sentry in his tower. 

His patient watch in silence keeping. 

And there, as ever, steep and clear, 

That pyramid of nature springs! 
He owns no rival turret near, 

No sovereign but the King of kings. 
( ?'01 ) 



MONADNOCK 

While many a nation hath passed by. 
And many an age, unknown in story. 

His walls and battlements on high 
He rears, in melancholy glory. 

And let a world of human pride. 

With all its grandeur, melt away. 
And spread around his rocky side 

The broken fragments of decay. 
Serene his hoary head will tower. 

Untroubled by one thought of sorrow; 
He numbers not the weary hour. 

He welcomes not nor fears to-morrow. 

Farewell! I go my distant way; 

Perhaps, not far in future years. 
The eyes that glow with smiles to-day. 

May gaze upon thee, dim with tears. 
Then let me learn from thee to rise. 

All time and chance and change defying; 
Still pointing upward to the skies. 

And on the inward strength relying. 

If life before my weary eye 
Grows fearful as an angry sea, 
( 302 ) 



MONADNOCK 



Thy memory shall suppress the sigh 
For that which never more can be. 

Inspiring all within the heart 

With firm resolve and strong endeavor. 

To act a brave and faithful part. 
Till life's short warfare ends forever. 

William Bourne Oliver Peabody. 



MOUNT AGASSIZ 

Before this mountain bore his well-loved name 
Whose greatness runs through both the hemi- 
spheres. 
Whose life-work, after death, but swells his fame, 
Whose sudden loss set Science' self in tears, — 
I stood upon it; now if I were there 
Among the flocking thoughts would this one brood. 
Mount Agassiz ! It must have known such prayer 
As rose at Penikees where once he stood 
Pleading with Heaven, yet uttering not a word. 
Leading the face and spirit of that throng 
On through an awe-hinged gate, that swung un- 
heard. 
Into His presence where all souls belong : — 
So doubtless here, with noisy words unshod, 
Went prayer in Horeb silence unto God. 

Charlotte Fiske Bates. 



( 304 ) 



SUNRISE ON THE HILLS 

I STOOD upon the hills, when heaven's wide arch 
Was glorious with the sun's returning march, 
And woods were brightened, and soft gales 
Went forth to kiss the sun-clad vales. 
The clouds were far beneath me; bathed in lights 
They gathered midway round the wooded height. 
And, in their fading glory, shone 
Like hosts in battle overthrown. 
As many a pinnacle, with shifting glance, 
Through the gray mist thrust up its shattered 

lance. 
And rocking on the cliff was left 
The dark pine blasted, bare, and cleft. 
The veil of cloud was lifted, and below 
Glowed the rich valley, and the river's flow 
Was darkened by the forest's shade. 
Or glistened in the white cascade ; 
Where upward, in the mellow blush of day. 
The noisy bittern wheeled his spiral way. 

I heard the distant waters dash, 
I saw the current whirl and flash, 
( 305 ) 



SUNRISE ON THE HILLS 

And richly, by the blue lake's silver beach, 
The woods were bending with a silent reach. 
Then o'er the vale, with gentle swell, 
The music of the village bell 
Came sweetly to the echo-giving hills; 
And the wild horn, whose voice the woodland fills. 
Was ringing to the merry shout 
That faint and far the glen sent out, 
Where, answering to the sudden shot, thin smoke. 
Through thick-leaved branches, from the dingle 
broke. 

If thou art worn and hard beset 
With sorrows, that thou wouldst forget, 
If thou wouldst read a lesson, that will keep 
Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep. 
Go to the woods and hills ! No tears 
Dim the sweet look that Nature wears. 

Henry Wads worth Longfellow. 



THE DISTANT HILLS 

With frontier strength ye stand your ground. 

With grand content ye circle round. 

Tumultuous silence for all sound. 

Ye distant nursery of rills, 

Monadnock and the Peterboro hills; — 

Firm argument that never stirs, 

Outcircling the philosophers, — 

Like some vast fleet. 

Sailing through rain and sleet. 

Through winter's cold and summer's heat; 

Still holding on upon your high emprise. 

Until ye find a shore amid the skies. 

While we enjoy a lingering ray. 
Ye still o'ertop the western day. 
Reposing yonder on God's croft 
Like solid stacks of hay; 
So bold a line as ne'er was writ 
On any page by human wit. 

Henry David Thoreau. 



( 307 ) 



THE HILLS OF DARTMOUTH 

Again among the hills! 

The shaggy hills ! 

The clear arousing air comes like a call 

Of bugle notes across the pines, and thrills 

My heart as if a hero had just spoken. 

Again among the hills! 

The jubilant unbroken 

Long dreaming of the hills ! 

Far off, Ascutney smiles as one at peace; 

And over all 

The golden sunlight pours and fills 

The hollow of the earth, like a God's joy. 

Again among the hills! 

The tranquil hills 

That took me as a boy 

And filled my spirit with the silences ! 

O indolent, far-reaching hills, that lie 
Secure in your own strength, and take your ease 
Like careless giants 'neath the summer sky — 
What is it to you, O hills, 

( 308 ) 



fr 



THE HILLS OF DARTMOUTH 

That anxious men should take thought for the 
morrow? 

What has your might to do with thought or sor- 
row 

Or cark and cumber of conflicting wills? 

Praise be to you, O hills, that you can breathe 

Into our souls the secret of your power! 

He is no child of yours, he never knew 

Your spirit — were he born beneath 

Your highest crags — who bears not every hour 

The might, the calm of you 

About him, that sublime 

Unconsciousness of all things great, — 

Built on himself to stand the shocks of Time 

And scarred, not shaken, by the bolts of Fate. 

Night on the hills ! 
And the ancient stars emerge. 
The silence of their mighty distances 
Compels the world to peace. Now sinks the surge 
Of life to a soft stir of mountain rills. 
And over the swarm and urge 
Of eager men sleep falls and darkling ease. 
( 309 ) 



THE HILLS OF DARTMOUTH 

Night on the hills! 

Dark mother-Night, draw near; 

Lay hands on us and whisper words of cheer 

So softly, oh, so softly ! Now may we 

Be each as one that leaves his midnight task 

And throws his casement oj>en; and the air 

Comes up across the lowlands from the Sea 

And cools his temples, as a maid might ask 

With shy caress what speech would never dare; 

And he leans back to her demure desires. 

And as a dream sees far below 

The city with its lights aglow 

And blesses in his heart his brothers there; 

Then toward the eternal stars again aspires. 

Richard Hovey. 



MONADNOCK FROM AFAR 

Dark flower of Cheshire garden, 

Red evening duly dyes 
Thy sombre head with rosy hues 

To fix far-gazing eyes. 
Well the Planter knew how strongly 

Works thy form on human thought; 
I muse what secret purpose had he 

To draw all fancies to this spot. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson.

BALD-CAP REVISITED 

Eleven years, and two fair months beside, 
Full to the brim with various love and joy, 
My life has known since last I drew apart 
Into this huge sky-shouldering mountain dome, 
And, listening, heard the winds among the pines 
Making a music as of countless choirs, 
Chanting in sweet and solemn unison; 
And, standing here where God's artificers. 
Angels of frost and fire and sun and storm, 
Have made a floor with nameless gems inlaid, 
Saw, like a roof, the slopes of living green 
Go cleaving down to meet the lower hills, — 
Firm-buttressed walls, their bases overgrown 
With meadow-sweet and ferns and tangled vines. 
And all that makes the roadsides beautiful; 
While, all around me, other domes arose. 
Girded with towers and eager pinnacles. 
Into the silent and astonished air. 
Full oft, since then, up-looking from below. 
As naught to me has been the pleasantness 
Of meadows broad, and, *mid them, flowing wide 
The Androscoggin's dark empurpled stream, 
( 312 ) 



If BALD-CAP REVISITED 

Enamored of thine awful loveliness, 

Thy draperies of forest overspread 

With shadows and with silvery, shining mists. 

Thy dark ravines and cloud-conversing top. 

Where it would almost seem that one might hear 

The talk of angels in the happy blue ; — 

And so, in truth, my heart has heard to-day. 

Dear sacred Mount, not thine alone the charm 
By which thou dost so overmaster me. 
But something in thy lover's beating heart, 
Something of memories vague and fond and sweet. 
Something of what he cannot be again, 
Something of sharp regret for vanished joys. 
And faces that he may no more behold, 
And voices that he listens for in vain. 
And feet whose welcome sound he hears no more, 
And hands whose touch could make his being 

thriU 
With love's dear rapture of delicious pain, — 
Something of all the years that he has lived. 
Of all the joy and sorrow he has known. 
Since first with eager feet and heart aflame 
He struggled up thy steep and shaggy sides, 
(313 ) 



BALD-CAP REVISITED 

Sun-flecked, leaf-shaded realms of life in death. 
And stood, as now upon thy topmost crest. 
Trembling with joy and tender unto tears; — 
Something of all these things mingles with thee, — 
Green of thy leaves and whiteness of thy clouds. 
Rush of thy streams and rustle of thy pines, — 
With all thy strength and all thy tenderness. 
Till thou art loved not for thyself alone. 
But for the love of many who are gone. 
And most of all for one who still remains 
To make all sights more fair, all sounds more sweet. 
All life more dear and glad and wonderful. 

John White Chadtvick. 



THE PRESENCE 



The mountain statelier lifts his blue-veiled head. 
While, drawing near, we meet him face to face. 

Here, as on holy ground, we softly tread; 
Yet, with a tender and paternal grace, 
He gives the wild flowers in his lap a place: 

They climb his sides, as fondled infants might. 
And wind around him, in a light embrace, 

Their summer drapery, pink and clinging white. 
Great hearts have largest room to bless the small; 

Strong natures give the weaker home and rest : 

So Christ took little children to his breast. 
And, with a reverence more profound, we fall 

In the majestic presence that can give 

Truth's simplest message: "*T is by love ye live." 

Lucy Larcom.

THE MOUNTAIN MAID 

O THE Mountain Maid, New Hampshire! 

Her steps are light and free, 
Whether she treads the lofty heights 

Or follows the brooks to the sea! 
Her eyes are clear as the skies that hang 

Over her hills of snow. 
And her hair is dark as the densest shade 

That falls where the fir-trees grow — 
The fir-trees slender and sombre 

That climb from the vales below. 

Sweet is her voice as the robin's 

In a lull of the wind of March 
Wooing the shy arbutus 

At the roots of the budding larch; 
And rich as the ravishing echoes 

On still Franconia's lake 
When the boatman winds his magic horn 

And the tongues of the wood awake. 
While the huge Stone-Face forgets to frown 

And the hare peeps out of the brake. 
( 316 ) 



I 



THE MOUNTAIN MAID 

The blasts of stormy December 

But brighten the bloom on her cheek, 
And the snows build her statelier temples 

Than to goddess were reared by the Greek. 
She welcomes the fervid summer, 

And flies to the sounding shore 
Where bleak Boar's Head looks seaward. 

Set in the billows' roar, 
And dreams of her sailors and fishers 

Till cool days come once more. 

Then how fair is the maiden. 

Crowned with the scarlet leaves. 
And wrapped in the tender, misty veil 

Her Indian Summer weaves! — 
While the aster blue, and the goldenrod. 

And immortelles, clustering sweet, 
From Canada down to the sea have spread 

A carpet for her feet; 
And the faint witch-hazel buds unfold. 

Her latest smile to greet. 

She loves the song of the reaper; 
The ring of the woodman's steel; 
(317 ) 



THE MOUNTAIN MAID 

The whir of the glancing shuttle; 

The rush of the tireless wheel. 
But, if war befalls, her sons she calls 

From mill and forge and lea. 
And bids them uphold her banner 

Till the land from strife is free; 
And she hews her oaks into mighty ships 

That sweep the foe from the sea. 

O the Mountain Maid, New Hampshire! 

For beauty and wit and will 
I'll pledge her, in draughts from her crystal 
springs, 

Rarest on plain or hill ! 
New York is a princess in purple 

By the gems of her cities crowned; 
Illinois with the garland of Ceres 

Her tresses of gold has bound. 
Queen of the limitless prairies 

Whose great sheaves heap the ground; 

And out by the vast Pacific, 
Their gay young sisters say: 
"Ours are the mines of the Indies, 
And the treasures of far Cathay;". 
( 318 )

THE MOUNTAIN MAID 



And the dames of the South walk proudly 
Where the fig and the orange fall 

And, hid in the high magnolias. 
The mocking thrushes call; 

But the Mountain Maid, New Hampshire, 
Is the rarest of them all!

THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS 



I HAVE passed the Uncanoonucs, and have trav- 
elled far away- 
Through the borderland of Mystery upon an 
endless quest; 
But other Uncanoonucs, glimmering in the twi- 
light gray, 
Still lift their hazy summits at the threshold 
of the West. 
One misty mountain overpassed upon the march 
of time, 
Another summit breaks in view, and onward 
still I roam — 
Another mountain in the mist which beckons me 
to climb. 
Like the Uncanoonuc Mountains which I used 
to see from home.

DEATH OF HAWTHORNE 

He rose upon an early da^wii of May, 

And looked upon the stream and meadow flowers, 

Then on the face of his beloved, and went; 

r 

And, passing, gazed upon the wayside haunt. 
The homely budding gardens by the road. 
And harvest promise, — still he said, I go. 

Once more he mingled in the midday crowd. 
And smiled a gentle smile, a sweet farewell, 
And moved toward the hills and laid him down. 

Lying, he looked beyond the pathless heights. 
Beyond the wooded steep and clouded peaks. 
And, looking, questioned, then he loved and slept. 

And while he slept his spirit walked abroad. 
And wandered past the mountain, past the cloud. 
Nor came again to rouse the form at peace. 

Though like some bird we strive to follow him, 
Fruitless we beat at the horizon's verge. 
And fruitless seek the fathomless blue beyond. 
(321 ) 




DEATH OF HAWTHORNE 

We work and wait, and water with salt tears. 
Learning to live that living we may sleep, 
And sleeping cross the mountains to God's rest. 

Annie Fields.
