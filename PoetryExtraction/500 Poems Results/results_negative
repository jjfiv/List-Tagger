savillonselegies00walliala_0015_1:0.0000:INTRODUCTION.
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_2:0.0250:MOST of the following Poems have appeared in
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_3:0.0500:our different Journals, under the fignatures of J. W.
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_4:0.0000:SOLANDER, Nox, &c. The principal object of
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_5:0.0500:arranging them in their prefent form, is to gratify
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_6:0.0000:the wifhes of particular friends, and I lament on this
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_7:0.0000:account, that many of my juvenile performances,
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_8:0.0500:(and among -them fome of thofe which I prized the
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_9:0.0000:moft) are loft or deftroyed ; fuch, however, as I
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_10:0.0250:have been able to collect, are here intruded to their
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_11:0.0000:notice. Written at a period, ere tafte had refined,
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_12:0.0000:or judgment fufficiently ripened the underftanding,
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_13:0.0000:they were never intended to brave the Critic's rod,
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_14:0.0000:nor to vie for the mead of praife, and their beauties
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_15:0.0000:(if they poflefs any) confift more in the penfive
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_16:0.0000:language of fentiment, than in the rapid and fome-
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_17:0.0000:times unintelligible flight of fuperior genius to the
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_18:0.0000:Parnaflian Mount.
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_19:0.0250:A perfon who writes at thirty, and revifes his

savillonselegies00walliala_0015_21:0.0000:and it will not be expected by the candid reader, that
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_22:0.0000:the poetic effufions of one, who has not reached the
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_23:0.0250:former period of life, fhould equal in brilliancy the
savillonselegies00walliala_0015_24:0.0500:productions of thofe who have had longer experience

savillonselegies00walliala_0016_2:0.0500:their native genius. The majority of thefe Eflays
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_3:0.0000:were penned, ere I had fcarce attained the age of
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_4:0.0000:manhood, being compofed during the interval of
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_5:0.0000:my entrance at, and my quitting the Univerfity,
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_6:0.0000:when, during the vacations, at a diftance from my
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_7:0.0000:aflbciates, and in the recefTes of a beloved retreat,
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_8:0.0250:I touched the firft chords of my melancholy lyre.
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_9:0.0250:In looking over the priftine efforts of my humble
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_10:0.0000:Mufc, by the aid of the pruning knife, I might, per-
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_11:0.0250:haps, have rendered them more worthy the attention
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_12:0.0500:of thofe who honor them with their patronage, but
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_13:0.0000:as they were never the lucubrations of deep ftudy,
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_14:0.0000:with little confideration, I refolvednot (in this re-
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_15:0.0000:fpecl, however) to amend the errors, or polifh the
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_16:0.0250:ideas of my early youth, but to prefent them in the
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_17:0.0000:fame fimple garb in which they originally met the
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_19:0.0250:Thofe lines and ideas which I was confcious, or
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_20:0.0500:even fufpe&ed, were not my own, are diftinguifhed

savillonselegies00walliala_0016_22:0.0250:cently involved myfelf in the guilt of plagiarifm, the
savillonselegies00walliala_0016_23:0.0500:offence, it is prefumed, will not be deemed paft re-

savillonselegies00walliala_0017_0:0.0250:INTRODUCTION.
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_1:0.0250:It is a misfortune with many in the very early
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_2:0.0250:part of life to abufe nature, by forming too mean an
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_3:0.0250:opinion of their own faculties : the diffident {trip-
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_5:0.0250:to evade the qucftion of experience; while the for-
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_6:0.0250:ward youth, endowed with more confidence, but
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_7:0.0250:poffibly inferior talents, boldly ft r ikes into the track
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_8:0.0000:of information, and challenges inquiry; he hears the
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_9:0.0500:voice of applaufe thunder in his ears, and carries off
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_10:0.0250:the palm of genius, which by natural right, is not
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_11:0.0250:unfrequently the property of the other : the former
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_12:0.0500:may be compared to the bafhful rofe, which, (though
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_13:0.0000:of fuperior beauty perhaps, but unconfcious of its
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_14:0.0250:bluming powers) appears to droop beneath the pride
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_15:0.0250:of the gaudy tulip, propt up againft the frowning
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_16:0.0250:tempeft ; and the timid mind, like the tender plant,
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_17:0.0250:requires to be defended againft the north wind; the
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_18:0.0250:flighteft injury will deprefs the fpirits of fome,
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_19:0.0250:though naturally courageous, while others, awake to
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_20:0.0250:wrongs, but of lefs delicate feelings, will foar above
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_21:0.0000:the threats of malice, and difperfe into air the breath
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_22:0.0250:of unmerited calumny : we look up to a great genius
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_23:0.0500:with an eye of admiration, but I am not fure if I
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_24:0.0250:would wifti to be that man, becaufe I think the per-
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_25:0.0250:fon of moderate capacity happieft of the two; he
savillonselegies00walliala_0017_27:0.0500:and avoids fplitting upon the rocks of envy.
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_0:0.0000:INTRODUCTION.
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_2:0.0250:troubles of a public fchool, numbering at that time,
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_3:0.0250:(I believe) upwards of three hundred boys, I had
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_4:0.0000:many a ftorm to weather, and many a buffet to con-
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_5:0.0000:quer : running from the confined illiterate nurfery
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_6:0.0000:into a learned extenfive feminary, where the pupils
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_7:0.0000:have generally imbibed their firft rudiments at letter
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_8:0.0250:fchools, my little fpirit, unable to brook the morti-
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_9:0.0000:fication of ignorance, laboured under the preflure of
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_10:0.0000:ideal inferiority, and from the fuppofition of its
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_11:0.0000:being itnpofiible to rival my clafs-mate of fuperior
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_12:0.0000:years and learning, I was difcouraged from trying
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_13:0.0250:the extent of thofe abilities, (however trivial they
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_14:0.0250:might be) with which Nature had gifced me; but
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_15:0.0500:time gradually draws afide the veil of felf-modefty,
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_16:0.0000:and emancipates us from error. As I encreafed in
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_17:0.0250:years, I confefs, I grew up in indolence, and my co-
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_18:0.0500:temporaries, with whom I was in habits of intimacy,
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_19:0.0250:will bear vvitnefs to the paftimes of a truant-boy,
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_20:0.0000:throwing afide his theme for the ruftic fports of a
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_21:0.0000:village fair, and of a college youth, enabled to mix
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_22:0.0250:in the circle of gaiety and pleafure, configning Eu-
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_23:0.0250:clid to his dungeon, for the more eafy and fafhion-
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_24:0.0000:able inftrudtions of a Newmarket Jockey : More
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_25:0.0000:ambitious to gain the love of my companions, than
savillonselegies00walliala_0018_26:0.0000:the approbation of my mafter, I endeavoured to ex-

savillonselegies00walliala_0019_2:0.0500:in trundling the hoop, or at the top-race ; but I fol-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_3:0.0000:lowed not with equal courage and agility, the martial
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_4:0.0000:Homer through the field of battle : the lag hound,
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_5:0.0000:though often as fleet as many others in the pack,
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_6:0.0000:muft be whipped up to his duty ; but the confe-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_7:0.0000:quences which followed a difobedience to the fum-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_8:0.0000:mons of the morning bell, were not fufficiently ter-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_9:0.0000:rific to roufe me from the arms of Morpheus; and
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_10:0.0000:this idle habit involved me in many difficulties : but
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_11:0.0250:however fevere our fufferings may have been, we
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_12:0.0000:caft back a grateful eye towards the fpot where our
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_13:0.0000:early friendfhips were formed ; where the fons of No-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_14:0.0000:bility and Traffic went hand in hand ; and the gene-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_15:0.0250:rous mind cherifhes a reverential love for thofe in-
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_16:0.0000:ftru&ors, who have been our firft guides in the paths
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_17:0.0500:of knowledge and of truth. Ye dear haunts, within
savillonselegies00walliala_0019_18:0.0250:the bounds of Harrow, of my thoughtlefs, boyifli

savillonselegies00walliala_0019_21:0.0000:I afk pardon of my ftrange readers, (ifanyfuch

savillonselegies00walliala_0020_21:0.0250:I too early imbibed fentirnents, which tin&ured my
savillonselegies00walliala_0020_22:0.0000:mind with a kind of romantic fadnefs, and I took up
savillonselegies00walliala_0020_23:0.0250:MELPOMENE'S doleful pipe to encourage and to in-
savillonselegies00walliala_0020_24:0.0000:dulge it. To me it was a pleafing tafk, to traverfe

savillonselegies00walliala_0021_3:0.0000:ginating in fi&ion, may too often be verified, were
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_4:0.0000:we to trace out the fecret abode of mifery ; for
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_5:0.0250:how often might we difcern the wretched Captive^
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_6:0.0000:lingering upon his bed of ftraw; the ruined Orphan^
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_7:0.0000:in tears of anguifh, recalling to memory the paft

savillonselegies00walliala_0021_9:0.0000:raving over the manes of his departed JULIA ! It
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_10:0.0000:would be difparaging the gifts of Providence and of
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_11:0.0500:Nature, were I to infinuate, that my forrows flowed
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_12:0.0250:from the fource of cruel y^^-misfortune; in the early
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_13:0.0000:fpring of life, with a fair profpecl before me, I had
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_14:0.0250:reafon to be content and happy ; but where is the
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_15:0.0000:Being; - the fage Philofopher, who can juftly
savillonselegies00walliala_0021_16:0.0000:claim the epithet of happy? There exifts an inter-

savillonselegies00walliala_0021_21:0.0500:Well aware as I am, how unacceptable would

savillonselegies00walliala_0158_5:0.0000:languid ftate of fufpenfe, which a fportfman feels
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_6:0.0500:when difappointed in his expectations, and contem-
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_7:0.0000:plating his future plan. The fcene around was
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_8:0.0500:calculated to infpire reflection, being romantic and
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_9:0.0250:pi&urefque ; on each fide were fields of waving
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_10:0.0000:corn, behind a woody dell, at the bottom of which a
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_11:0.0000:bubbling ftream foftly murmured its irregular courfe :
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_12:0.0000:the profpect before prefented a grafly lawn, about a
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_13:0.0250:mile in extent, interfperfed with fpreading oaks, and
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_14:0.0000:here and there, flood a folitary fhrub, a fad remnant,
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_15:0.0000:as it feemed, to tell the enquiring paflenger that the
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_16:0.0500:fpot had formerly been the refidence of grandeur and
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_18:0.0000:Pleafed with the delightful folitude, it was fome
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_19:0.0000:time before I difcovered a fmall cottage, which raifed
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_20:0.0000:its humble top, fituated upon a rifing flope, at the
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_21:0.0500:extreme verge of that lawn I have defcribed.
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_22:0.0250:Undetermined as to my future route, added to a
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_23:0.0000:total ignorance of the country, I was induced on
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_24:0.0000:the fcore of information to approach it; befides, a
savillonselegies00walliala_0158_25:0.0000:material part of my apparatus, through eagernefs in
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_4:0.0250:and which I had placed on the table a few minutes
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_5:0.0500:only before my fetting out : a draught of new milk
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_6:0.0500:would have been a luxurious banquet to a tired and
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_7:0.0250:thirfty fportfman. On a nearer afpe& of this almoft

savillonselegies00walliala_0159_10:0.0000:like a fhed for cattle, to feek refuge under from the
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_11:0.0000:adverfe ftorm, than the habitation of a human being ;
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_12:0.0000:but what was my furprize, when on entering, in-
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_13:0.0000:ftead of finding a fhepherd,' or a cow-boy, to direct
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_14:0.0250:my weary fteps, fir etched on the bed, (or rather the
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_15:0.0250:floor) of poverty, in a dirty linen garb, lay apparently
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_16:0.0500:in ficknefs, one of the faireft forms of Nature's
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_17:0.0500:work flaxen ringlets, remarkably long and ftriking,
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_18:0.0500:meandered in difhevelled order, nearly to the bot-
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_19:0.0500:tom of her waift. The figure of an aged matron,
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_20:0.0250:with her head inclined downwards, and clafping a
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_21:0.0000:delicately white hand, fat forrowing by her fide.
savillonselegies00walliala_0159_22:0.0000:Loft in wild admiration, I had gazed fometime un-
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_2:0.0000:eyes from the ground, I approached, and my conjec-
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_3:0.0250:tures were confirmed. Death feemed fufpended but
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_4:0.0500:for a few minutes : the fair object of my enquiry
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_5:0.0000:appeared infenfible to what patted; her countenance
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_6:0.0000:which was engagingly expreffive, pourtrayed the
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_7:0.0500:mixed traits of forrow and hopeful refignation; her
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_8:0.0000:eye-lids half clofed, difplayed long dark lafhes, the
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_10:0.0250:though evidently in extreme illnefs, her cheeks ftill
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_11:0.0250:retained a faint glow which flattered with {lender
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_12:0.0500:hopes of life : it was that kind of face which would
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_14:0.0000:though it might not, perhaps, bear pulling to pieces
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_15:0.0000:by the fcrutinizing eye of female envy, yet boafted the
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_16:0.0250:charm of modeft fweetnefs, blended with good-nature,
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_17:0.0500:morepleafmg fometimes, than the regular lineaments
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_18:0.0250:of perfect, but often inanimate beauty.
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_20:0.0500:fwers fucceeded each other, and I found from her
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_23:0.0250:laboured) three weeks fince, lingering in the ftate
savillonselegies00walliala_0160_24:0.0000:I beheld her, with little relief or affiftance the whole
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_6:0.0500:pended, and Sangrado, in his profeflional purfuits,
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_11:0.0500:unaffifted ? It was a good three miles to the vil-
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_12:0.0500:lage where the Doctor lived, but directed to a neigh-
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_13:0.0250:bouring farmer, by the help of a ready faddled deed,
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_14:0.0000:I difpatched an honeft countryman, who in lefs than
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_15:0.0250:an hour had reached the hamlet, and returned again
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_16:0.0250:with this ragged fon of Efculapius^ who refembled
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_19:0.0500:breathed her laft, and lay a clay-cold corpfe. A fe-
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_21:0.0500:fat upon her lifelefs features; lovely even in death.
savillonselegies00walliala_0161_22:0.0500:Moved with the affecting fcene, I gazed in filent for-
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_1:0.0000:materials : perhaps a profeffion which expofed
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_2:0.0250:him often to fimilar fcenes of diftrefs, might have
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_3:0.0250:harden'd his feelings, and rendered them callous to
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_4:0.0250:thofe fenfations which EDMUND felt; and that af-
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_5:0.0250:fliction, which he could not witnefs without par-
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_7:0.0250:RET'S grief for fhe fat weeping bitterly by the
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_8:0.0250:bed- fide of her departed friend. I rewarded this
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_9:0.0000:mock Phyfician^ (a diftinclion he had aflumed) for
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_10:0.0000:his trouble, and we parted.
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_11:0.0250:Too much interefted with my adventure, and pre-
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_12:0.0000:vented by humanity abruptly to leave the cottage,
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_13:0.0250:I had now time for reflection ; and curiofity as well
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_14:0.0250:as other motives, prompted me to inveftigate the
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_15:0.0000:labyrinth in which I was immured, and to unravel
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_16:0.0000:a myftery, at once fo novel and romantic. I learned
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_17:0.0000:from the good old woman, that fhe had known
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_18:0.0000:MARIA about fix months, previous to which fhe
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_19:0.0000:had lived in the fervice of a widow lady in the neigh-
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_20:0.0000:bourhood ; but that on finding the work too hard for
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_21:0.0000:a fickly conftitution, fhe left her place, and had fmce
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_22:0.0250:fought a livelihood by making of bafkets, (an art
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_23:0.0000:which fhe herfelf had taught her) and carrying
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_24:0.0500:them for fale about the country; adding, that MARIA
savillonselegies00walliala_0162_25:0.0500:had often told her, fhe was by birth and education
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_5:0.0250:fed it in tears ; and, if I had only wept before, I now
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_6:0.0000:felt the pangs of real diftrefs; penned in a ftyle that
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_7:0.0000:would have done credit to a performance compofed
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_8:0.0000:at any age, with the advantage of claflical erudition ;
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_9:0.0000:{he enumerated in pathetic language, as far as recol-
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_10:0.0000:le&ion enabled, the innocent pleafures of her early
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_11:0.0000:infancy, advancing in a progreflive manner to the
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_12:0.0250:period which clofed her exigence. The daughter
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_13:0.0000:of a country gentleman, and heirefs to a confiderable
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_14:0.0250:fortune, fhe had received a brilliant education, be-
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_15:0.0000:loved by her friends, and happy in the affedlion of a
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_16:0.0500:tender parent. Thus had the fleeting years rolled
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_17:0.0000:on in peace and gaiety, till that age when the mind
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_18:0.0250:begins to expand, and love, often in the garb of
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_19:0.0250:friendfhip, fteals, byfoft infinuation, its unobftrudted
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_20:0.0500:paflage into the female bofom. Among others who
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_21:0.0000:vifited at her father's, was a gentleman of fmall pro-
savillonselegies00walliala_0163_22:0.0250:perty in the Weft-Indies, agreeable in his perfon,

savillonselegies00walliala_0163_25:0.0500:on their union or feparationj and at length in the
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_1:0.0250:frantic hour of intoxicated love, they eloped, and fet
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_2:0.0000:fail for Barbadoes, where the marriage ceremony was
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_3:0.0250:to be folemnized, but ere they had reached the
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_4:0.0250:anxious port which was to crown all their wifhes,
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_5:0.0000:the being in whofe fate was centered her every
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_6:0.0000:thought, inherited a watery grave : a fatal fhip wreck
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_7:0.0000:had been the confequence, and MARIA, with five
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_11:0.0250:formed her of her lofs, (he would have daflied from
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_12:0.0000:the rock which favored their efcape, and perifhed
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_13:0.0000:with her lover in the devouring deep : but fhe was
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_14:0.0250:referved for future mifery : left to fcale the fummit
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_15:0.0250:of defpair and wretchednefs, caft on a ftrange fhore,
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_16:0.0250:friendlefs and unknown, and all parental concern
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_18:0.0000:which at length rendered her an eafy conqueft to the
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_19:0.0500:wiles of man ; but fcarce had fhe culled the glaring
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_20:0.0000:flowers of vice, than withering in her hand, fhe
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_21:0.0250:hurled them from her touch; returned difgufted
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_23:0.0250:the tracks of virtue. Once more landed by her
savillonselegies00walliala_0164_24:0.0500:falfe admirer, (who promifed a fafe paflage) on her
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_0:0.0500:A FRAGMENT.
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_3:0.0500:for however fweet the rofes with which illufive
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_7:0.0500:avenues which lead to Virtue's facred temple, are
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_8:0.0250:ftrewed with evergreens, that flourifh in undecaying
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_10:0.0250:wandered from village to village in fearch of em-
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_11:0.0250:ployment, and at laft had found, if not a happy, at
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_12:0.0250:leaft a calm afylum in the retreat of induftry.
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_13:0.0500:Thus, the unpitied victim of remorfe, fhe had
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_14:0.0500:only reached her three-and- twentieth year, when
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_16:0.0500:prolonged but in miferv. But for that one irre-
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_17:0.0250:trievable error, her character was fair and fpotlefs :
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_18:0.0000:could .that have been effaced, and had it pleafed the
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_19:0.0250:Almighty to have reftored her to the world, as Sterne
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_24:0.0000:board with me, have fhared the fame repaft, and have
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_25:0.0500:been to me perhaps a wife: but fate and heaven or-
savillonselegies00walliala_0165_26:0.0500:dained it otherwife, and it is well. Wrapt up in
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_1:0.0500:fentiment, I left the humble roof which had given
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_6:0.0500:My mind entertained not the fmalleft doubt re-
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_7:0.0000:fpefting the truth of MARIA'S narrative ; and had
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_8:0.0500:I been inclined, I wiflied not to queftion its veracity.
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_9:0.0250:After neceflary refrefhment, I fought the pillow of
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_10:0.0250:repofe, and awoke the next morning, as it were
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_11:0.0500:from a vifionary dream, and fcarce able to convince
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_12:0.0250:myfelf, that the fcene I had been witnefs to, was
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_13:0.0000:more than the mere illufion of fancy. Alas ! it was
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_14:0.0000:but too true ! the pleafures of the field were for the
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_15:0.0250:prefent only a fecondary confederation ; my thoughts
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_16:0.0250:were more pleafmgly engaged : a few guineas made
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_17:0.0250:but a fmall decreafe in my finances, and when ex-
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_18:0.0000:pended in the caufe of humanity, the idea became
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_19:0.0250:doubly pleafing. I refolved, therefore, on feeing
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_20:0.0000:MARIA decently interred; and ere a week had
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_21:0.0250:elapfed, her poor remains, attended by a few village
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_22:0.0250:peafants, were borne to their long dark abode, un-
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_23:0.0000:honoured by the tear of pity, or the groan of lamen-
savillonselegies00walliala_0166_24:0.0000:tation ; but that they might reft in peace, and revive
savillonselegies00walliala_0167_2:0.0000:the abufe of unmerited fcandal, I mixed not in the
savillonselegies00walliala_0167_3:0.0250:train at MARIA'S funeral, (a tafk which would have

poems___00wott_0014_12:0.0000:Mr. Dyce, who has lately edited Wotton's own Poems for
poems___00wott_0014_13:0.0000:the Percy Society, in a separate form, has adopted an ar-
poems___00wott_0014_14:0.0000:rangement which comes much nearer to the order in which
poems___00wott_0014_15:0.0000:they would be composed; but we have not sufficient infor-
poems___00wott_0014_16:0.0000:mation to determine the exact date of every poem.*
poems___00wott_0014_20:0.0250:* The following is a summary of the chronological facts already known,
poems___00wott_0014_22:0.0000:N°. ii may also be regarded as a youthful composition. N". xiii could not
poems___00wott_0014_23:0.0000:be written till after 1604, and may have been composed at a much later
poems___00wott_0014_24:0.0000:date. No. viii is said to have been printed in 1614, and can be traced
poems___00wott_0014_25:0.0000:soon afterwards. If No. iv was really addressed to Buckingham, it falls
poems___00wott_0014_26:0.0000:later than August, 1616, when he was raised to the Peerage. It would be

poems___00wott_0014_28:0.0000:in 1623. No. vii was written either in 1615 or 1621, probably the former;
poems___00wott_0014_29:0.0000:No. iii about 1620 ; No. xi in 1625 ; and N". xii in 1627. If N°. x was
poems___00wott_0014_30:0.0000:■written in pursuance of the design mentioned in the Introduction to it, we
poems___00wott_0014_31:0.0000:must place it in or after 1627. No. v was written in 1630 ; N". vi in 1633 ;

poems___00wott_0016_13:0.0000:they were found among his papers ; — in one case especially,
poems___00wott_0016_14:0.0250:the " Description of the Country's Recreations," this seems
poems___00wott_0016_15:0.0000:very probable; — and it is also possible that he was the

poems___00wott_0017_8:0.0000:Some Poems in Part I. have been claimed for other writers
poems___00wott_0017_9:0.0000:(N*^. i. vi. vii. xiii) ; but Wotton has gained as well as lost by
poems___00wott_0017_10:0.0000:the general confusion of property in these smaller composi-
poems___00wott_0017_11:0.0000:tions. It is not necessary to give a list of all the poems
poems___00wott_0017_12:0.0000:which have been erroneously attributed to him ; but two in-
poems___00wott_0017_13:0.0000:stances may be mentioned, because they are brought forward
poems___00wott_0017_14:0.0000:by better authorities than usual. — Archbishop Sancroft as-
poems___00wott_0017_15:0.0000:signs to him one of the most popular pieces printed among the
poems___00wott_0017_16:0.0000:Poems of Carew ; it has also been given to Lord Pembroke ;
poems___00wott_0017_17:0.0000:but Carew's title will probably be thought most valid, not by
poems___00wott_0017_18:0.0500:any means from the authority of the Collection which bears
poems___00wott_0017_19:0.0250:his name, but from the nature of the verses.* — Mr. Collier
poems___00wott_0017_20:0.0000:has printed, from Ben Jonson's handwriting, a translation
poems___00wott_0017_21:0.0000:of Martial's Vitam qua faciunt bcatiorem, which he thought
poems___00wott_0017_22:0.0000:might be Wotton's, because the same paper contained one
poems___00wott_0017_23:0.0000:of Wotton's pieces which Jonson had transcribed (see p. 29) ;
poems___00wott_0017_24:0.0000:but there can be no doubt that it is Jonson's own, as he told
poems___00wott_0017_25:0.0250:Drummond that he had translated that very Epigram.f
poems___00wott_0017_27:0.0250:repr. of 1824. The other copies are in Pembroke's Poems, 1660, p. 92,
poems___00wott_0017_28:0.0000:aud MS.Tann. 465, fol. 60. A fourth is in Wit Restored, 1G58, p. 114. It

poems___00wott_0017_34:0.0000:frequeuily translated, as by Surrey (p. 43, ed. Nutt"), Randolph (p. 61, ed.
poems___00wott_0017_35:0.0000:1668), &c. From one of Howell's Letters, it seems tliat he and Sir Thomas
poems___00wott_0017_36:0.0000:Lake had written rival translations for a wager, and that Sir Kenelm Digby
poems___00wott_0017_37:0.0000:adjudged Lake's to be the better. (Ep. Ho-El. 5 5, p. 31, ed. 1645.) There
poems___00wott_0017_38:0.0000:is another translation in MS. Mai. 14, p. 34. Jonson wa^^ have transcribed
poems___00wott_0017_39:0.0500:a friend's translation, in addition to translating it himself; but the internal
poems___00wott_0017_40:0.0250:evidence, as Mr. Collier remarks, is decidedly iu hit favour.
poems___00wott_0018_4:0.0000:he seldom committed anything to the press. There were,
poems___00wott_0018_5:0.0500:however, at least three things which were printed during his
poems___00wott_0018_8:0.0250:one of the Chief Magistrates of Augsburg, and dispersed it
poems___00wott_0018_9:0.0000:in most parts of Italy and Germany. This Epistle, in which
poems___00wott_0018_10:0.0000:much excellent vituperation is wasted on a very unworthy
poems___00wott_0018_11:0.0250:object, was occasioned by the results of an indiscretion com-
poems___00wott_0018_12:0.0000:mitted in 1604, when he was on his way to Venice. In the

poems___00wott_0018_15:0.0000:portant office, Wotton grew facetious about his new dignity,
poems___00wott_0018_16:0.0000:and propounded his famous definition of an Ambassador, —
poems___00wott_0018_17:0.0250:*' an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his

poems___00wott_0018_26:0.0250:+ Here we meet with a difficnlty in passing. Wotton's name does not
poems___00wott_0018_27:0.0250:occur in the printed list of James's crowd of Knights; and the Records of
poems___00wott_0018_28:0.0000:the Herald's College will not supply the deficiency. Some have conjectured
poems___00wott_0018_29:0.0000:that he was knighted in Scotland, which is flatly at variance with Walton's
poems___00wott_0018_30:0.0500:narrative (p. 142). But it is known that some knighthoods were never re-
poems___00wott_0018_31:0.0250:corded, because the new knights would not pay their fees.

poems___00wott_0019_12:0.0250:Wotton had to learn caution from experience ; for there were three other
poems___00wott_0019_13:0.0250:matters in his first Venetian Embassy for which he has been blamed : first,
poems___00wott_0019_14:0.0000:for "injurious speeches" against the King of France in 1G04 (Camd. Ann.
poems___00wott_0019_15:0.0000:Jac. I. pp. 3,84); secondly, and most unjustly, for delaying to present
poems___00wott_0019_16:0.0000:King James's Book to the Venetian Senate (see the extracts in Bio. Brit.vL
poems___00wott_0019_17:0.0000:4343.); thirdly, for being (as some thought) too zealous for his Master's

poems___00wott_0019_20:0.0000:have sprung from prejudice.
poems___00wott_0019_22:0.0250:consequence. Let us see how far this is true. — In 1612, he was Ambassador
poems___00wott_0019_23:0.0000:to Savoy. We have contemporary accounts of his setting out in March
poems___00wott_0019_24:0.0500:and returning in the end of July (Winwood, iii. 353, 367, 384; Nichols's
poems___00wott_0019_25:0.0000:Progresses of James I. ii. 438, 460 ; cf. Letters of F. Paul, 1693, pp. 322-5) ;
poems___00wott_0019_26:0.0000:and among the Ashm. MSS.(1729, Lett. 114-6) are two autograph lettersfrom
poems___00wott_0019_27:0.0250:Wotton to Lord Pembroke written during his absence, one dated from the
poems___00wott_0019_28:0.0000:foot of M. Cenis, May 9: 1612 : (with a journal) the other dated from Tu-
poems___00wott_0019_29:0.0000:rin, May 28: 1612:— The accusation of Scioppius does not appear to have
poems___00wott_0019_30:0.0000:been known till after his return (Winw. iii. 407; Nichols, ib. 468) ; and his
poems___00wott_0019_31:0.0000:letter to Welser is dated Dec. 1612. Within a year after that period (viz.
poems___00wott_0019_32:0.0250:Nov. 16: evidently in 1613), he told Sir Edmund Bacon that the King had
poems___00wott_0019_33:0.0000:expressed a " general purpose" to put him " again into some use." (Rel.
poems___00wott_0019_34:0.0000:Wotton. p. 429.) The result of this I do not know ; but he was again sent
poems___00wott_0019_35:0.0250:abroad before November, 1614, for Mr. Collier has recently printed a letter

poems___00wott_0020_25:0.0000:respectful letters to bim (p. 561). In another place, Wotton speaks out,
poems___00wott_0020_26:0.0000:more boldly than he was wont to do, of the way in which Weston had
poems___00wott_0020_27:0.0000:made a scorn of his poverty and a sport of his modesty (p. 468). Con-

poems___00wott_0022_2:0.0250:would be of much greater length ; for he too often wasted
poems___00wott_0022_3:0.0250:his energies in making good beginnings. This may have
poems___00wott_0022_4:0.0000:been what Warton meant, when he called him " a polite
poems___00wott_0022_5:0.0000:scholar, but on the whole a mixed and desultory character,"
poems___00wott_0022_6:0.0500:— an account with which Sir Egerton Brydges, perhaps
poems___00wott_0022_7:0.0000:through a feeling of sympathy, was far from satisfied. It is

poems___00wott_0026_8:0.0250:it would be impossible to enter on the subject here. Any
poems___00wott_0026_9:0.0250:elaborate details of dates and pedigrees would be still less

poems___00wott_0026_22:0.0000:ter of Sir W. Finch, and widow of Robert Morion, esq., he had only two
poems___00wott_0026_23:0.0000:sons, William, who was born Apr. 14: 1566: and died in the July of the same
poems___00wott_0026_24:0.0000:year; and Henry, who was born March 30: 156S: — George Morton, esq.,

poems___00wott_0026_29:0.0000:Letters cited by Birch (Life of Pr. Henry, p. 171); and I think in one of
poems___00wott_0026_30:0.0000:those to Lord Pembroke, preserved among the Ashm. MSS. ; though only
poems___00wott_0026_31:0.0000:the first and last letters of his name can be now decyphered. His appoint-

poems___00wott_0026_33:0.0000:Wotton. pp. 42] -5; Winwood, iii. 469); and his future advancement may

poems___00wott_0030_14:0.0000:by an asterisk, as having been previously ascribed to him
poems___00wott_0030_15:0.0000:by Birch. Seven of those are reprinted in this volume ;*

poems___00wott_0030_17:0.0000:the ninth is the poem prefixed to Gascoigne's Steele-Glass,
poems___00wott_0030_18:0.0000:in 1576 (N*>. xvi), about which there is some difficulty.
poems___00wott_0030_19:0.0000:Two objections have been raised; namely, that the writer's
poems___00wott_0030_20:0.0000:name is spelt in an unusual manner, and that he describes
poems___00wott_0030_21:0.0000:himself as " of the Middle Temple," while Raleigh declared
poems___00wott_0030_22:0.0000:on his trial, that he had never " read a word of the law or
poems___00wott_0030_23:0.0000:statute before" he " was prisoner in the Tower."f The first
poems___00wott_0030_24:0.0000:cannot be allowed much weight (see p. 95) ; to the second,
poems___00wott_0030_30:0.0500:rowed from the signature. Naunton says, " His approaches to the Univer-

poems___00wott_0031_3:0.0000:riance. Oldys and Brydges assume that it is completely in
poems___00wott_0031_4:0.0250:Raleigh's favour; Mr. D'Israeli, also, though he hesitates
poems___00wott_0031_5:0.0000:about the spelling, says that " tiiese verses, both by their
poems___00wott_0031_6:0.0000:spirit and signature, cannot fail to be his ;" while Mr. Tyt-
poems___00wott_0031_7:0.0000:ler says, that " although written in the quaint style of his
poems___00wott_0031_8:0.0000:age, their poetical merit is below his other pieces, and it is
poems___00wott_0031_9:0.0000:difficult to believe that they flowed from the same sweet
poems___00wott_0031_10:0.0000:vein which produced the answer to Marlow's Passionate
poems___00wott_0031_11:0.0500:Shepherd."* Such are the advantages we gain by turning
poems___00wott_0031_12:0.0500:to internal evidence.
poems___00wott_0031_13:0.0000:Two other poems in the list (N^ x. xix.) are said to have
poems___00wott_0031_14:0.0250:the very dubious authority of Raleigh's obliterated initials
poems___00wott_0031_15:0.0250:in England's Helicon. To what I have elsewhere said on
poems___00wott_0031_16:0.0000:this pointjf I have only to add, that a very different copy of
poems___00wott_0031_17:0.0000:N**. X. was printed anonymously in Davison's Rhapsodic ;
poems___00wott_0031_18:0.0000:and that Brydges, in his reprint of Davison, included it
poems___00wott_0031_19:0.0000:among Raleigh's Poems, but confessedly without any au-
poems___00wott_0031_20:0.0250:thority. That copy therefore, gives us no assistance. As

poems___00wott_0031_25:0.0000:also think that the " solid axiomatical vein" which Oldys observed in the
poems___00wott_0031_26:0.0000:lines on Gascoigue.is more characteristic of Raleigh's style than the " sweet
poems___00wott_0031_27:0.0000:vein" which Mr. Tytler discovers in the other poem, which was meant for
poems___00wott_0031_28:0.0250:a grave and earnest rebuke to all " sweet" Pastorals.

poems___00wott_0034_36:0.0000:A. W. ; and therefore, as the List contains tiie first lines of N"*. ii, xiv,
poems___00wott_0034_37:0.0250:xviii, xxiii, and xxiv, those pieces must be at once excluded from Raleigh's
poems___00wott_0034_38:0.0250:Poems. — Ellis and Cayley had preceded Brydges in giving to Raleigh
poems___00wott_0034_39:0.0500:two of the five, viz. N"^* xiv. and xxiv. — In the Preface to his repr. of E.
poems___00wott_0035_2:0.0000:two were given up by Brydges himself, — we are not disposed
poems___00wott_0035_3:0.0000:to trust it any longer. We may therefore say at once, that
poems___00wott_0035_4:0.0000:the five which still remain unmentioned (N•'^ v, vii, ix, xiii,
poems___00wott_0035_5:0.0500:and xv) have been printed among Raleigh's Poems without
poems___00wott_0035_6:0.0250:any evidence at all.* Besides, if Igiwlo had any special
poems___00wott_0035_7:0.0250:significance in the body of the book, it must have had the
poems___00wott_0035_8:0.0000:same in the Table of Contents, which was inserted in the
poems___00wott_0035_10:0.0500:Collection of Raleigh's Poems in 1813. Ritson also was ignorant of that
poems___00wott_0035_11:0.0250:document when he compiled his Bibl. Poet., as is plain from his article on
poems___00wott_0035_12:0.0000:A. W., p. 382. When, therefore, he affirmed that N". ii was "ascertained
poems___00wott_0035_13:0.0000:to be the composition of Francis Davison'" (ib. p. 255), it can scarcely have
poems___00wott_0035_14:0.0000:been because he had any reasons for regarding A. VV, as a signature used
poems___00wott_0035_15:0.0000:by Davison himself. It is more likely that this was the only one of the five
poems___00wott_0035_16:0.0000:which he had observed in Davison's Collection, and that he assigned it to
poems___00wott_0035_17:0.0000:the editor as a matter of course, just as he seems to have done in the case
poems___00wott_0035_18:0.0000:of a more famous poem (see this vol. p. 91). Steevens had pencilled Da-

poems___00wott_0035_27:0.0000:XV ; and a third, N". ix, has since been reprinted as Raleigh's by Camp-
poems___00wott_0035_28:0.0000:bell, no doubt on Brydgcs's authority. The Muse's Library contains copies
poems___00wott_0035_29:0.0000:of N"s. vii and xiii from E. H., but they are properly printed as anony-

poems___00wott_0035_37:0.0000:the signature Ignoto (see below). He thus began the system of trusting to

poems___00wott_0035_39:0.0000:Brydges completed. The Reply to Marlow rests on other tes'imony. — I
poems___00wott_0035_40:0.0000:may add, that a MS. remark of Dr. Farmer's is cited in Cens. Lit. i. 162,
poems___00wott_0035_41:0.0000:as assigning this Imitation of Marlow to Shakespeare; but that note must
poems___00wott_0035_42:0.0000:have belonged either to the original Song, or to the Reply, which immedi-

poems___00wott_0036_35:0.0000:stances ; for those words have an obvious meaning ; but why sliould Raleigh,
poems___00wott_0036_36:0.0000:or any one else, monopolize the title of the Unknozvn Poet ? — Some of
poems___00wott_0036_37:0.0000:Brydges's remarks in that place betray a strange forgetfulness of his Pre-
poems___00wott_0036_38:0.0000:face to the reprint of E. H., which appeared before the publication of Ra-
poems___00wott_0036_39:0.0000:leigh's Poerns. '' To one of these poems in the first edition of the ' Helicon,'

poems___00wott_0036_43:0.0500:apprehension that the piece was Raleigh's." In the reprint of E. H., he
poems___00wott_0037_1:0.0500:cover any recondite signification from the manner in which
poems___00wott_0037_2:0.0000:it is employed in Davison or Rel. Wotton. If we turn to
poems___00wott_0037_3:0.0250:other publications, the indefinite character of the signature
poems___00wott_0037_4:0.0000:becomes still more apparent.* When Warton called it
poems___00wott_0037_5:0.0500:" Raleigh's constant signature," he probably meant only
poems___00wott_0037_6:0.0250:that Raleigh frequently used it, as others might do like-
poems___00wott_0037_7:0.0000:wise.f But an occasional or even a frequent use of it
poems___00wott_0037_8:0.0000:would give us no information, unless it was also exclusive,
poems___00wott_0037_10:0.0500:said that two which were so marked belonged to Shakespeare and Barn-
poems___00wott_0037_11:0.0250:field ; and that a t/iird was given, in another part of the same volume, to

poems___00wott_0037_31:0.0000:Warton had been speaking of Marlow's Passionate Shepherd ; and after

poems___00wott_0037_35:0.0000:imitated by Raleigh." If he had any " good reasons for his opinion," we
poems___00wott_0037_36:0.0000:can only regret that he " neglected to adduce them;" but he was probably
poems___00wott_0037_37:0.0000:thinking only of the poem before him, which most agree to treat as Ra-

poems___00wott_0042_37:0.0000:that Raleigh wrote it also. Malone (who remarks that there is another
poems___00wott_0042_38:0.0000:copy in the Phoenix Nest) thought, from the metre, that it was Sir Edward

poems___00wott_0044_9:0.0000:Raleigh without fear of contradiction. That he wrote more
poems___00wott_0044_10:0.0250:poems than we now possess, is beyond dispute. We may well
poems___00wott_0044_11:0.0000:wonder, with Malone, that his *' Cynthia" has been allowed
poems___00wott_0044_12:0.0000:to perish ; but many others of his compositions must have
poems___00wott_0044_13:0.0000:shared its fate ; for there is little left to account for the quaint
poems___00wott_0044_14:0.0250:commendations of Puttenham, jNIeres, and Bolton, still less
poems___00wott_0044_15:0.0250:to justify the glorious praise of Spenser. It is some consola-
poems___00wott_0044_16:0.0000:tion, however, to remember, that the stores of Elizabethan
poems___00wott_0044_17:0.0500:poetry are not yet exhausted ; and that those who are not
poems___00wott_0044_18:0.0250:debarred, by the confinement of a country residence, from
poems___00wott_0044_19:0.0000:free access to our Public Libraries, may yet find many relics
poems___00wott_0044_20:0.0000:of his poetry which I have neither seen nor heard of. Few
poems___00wott_0044_21:0.0000:discoveries of the kind would be more pleasing than one
poems___00wott_0044_22:0.0000:which should authorize us to conclude, that Raleigh himself
poems___00wott_0044_23:0.0000:was the anonymous friend of Francis Davison, who is now
poems___00wott_0044_24:0.0000:known only by the unexplained initials A. W.; but this is
poems___00wott_0044_25:0.0000:more than we can venture to anticipate. Yet Brydges was

poems___00wott_0045_5:0.0000:one of Raleigh's chief characteristics. Indeed he often begins
poems___00wott_0045_6:0.0000:much better than he ends. Among other instances, Brydges
poems___00wott_0045_7:0.0000:mentions " Smooth are thy lookes ; so is the deepest streame"
poems___00wott_0045_8:0.0000:— a line which at once reminds us of the commencement of

poems___00wott_0047_1:0.0500:It is now time to sum up the evidence wliich has been
poems___00wott_0047_2:0.0000:brought together, by making it the basis of a new classi-
poems___00wott_0047_3:0.0000:tication of Raleigh's reputed poems. I have hitherto ex-
poems___00wott_0047_4:0.0000:amined them in the order presented by his editors : and any
poems___00wott_0047_5:0.0000:attempt to m.ike a better arrangement must necessarily be
poems___00wott_0047_6:0.0000:defective, as I cannot suppose that all the evidence has
poems___00wott_0047_7:0.0000:been exhausted. But the enquiry has been already pursued
poems___00wott_0047_8:0.0000:to a much greater extent than I intended ; and it would
poems___00wott_0047_9:0.0000:therefore be improper to stop short of its legitimate con-
poems___00wott_0047_10:0.0000:clusion. Moreover, a revision of the subject will give me
poems___00wott_0047_11:0.0000:the opportunity of furnishing complete copies of several
poems___00wott_0047_12:0.0000:poems, which have been only alluded to elsewhere.
poems___00wott_0047_13:0.0000:In the case of any man but Raleigh, this would be, in the
poems___00wott_0047_14:0.0000:main, a question of degrees of evidence, — whether it were
poems___00wott_0047_15:0.0000:more or less conclusive in each particular instance. But
poems___00wott_0047_16:0.0000:the Collection published by Sir Egerton Brydges was made
poems___00wott_0047_17:0.0000:in such a predatory spirit, that we must be content, in
poems___00wott_0047_18:0.0250:Raleigh's case, with a ruder mode of classification ; and
poems___00wott_0047_19:0.0000:must ask only, — whether there be any positive evidence^br
poems___00wott_0047_20:0.0000:him, or any positive evidence against him, or simply no
poems___00wott_0047_21:0.0000:evidence at all. The poems, then, will fall into three
poems___00wott_0047_22:0.0500:classes, answering to these, though in a slightly different
poems___00wott_0047_23:0.0000:order. In the first, we must place all those pieces which
poems___00wott_0047_24:0.0000:can be assigned to Raleigh with any kind of probability,
poems___00wott_0047_25:0.0000:even if it often falls far short of certainty. The second may
poems___00wott_0047_26:0.0000:include those which are altogether uncertain, — of which we
poems___00wott_0047_27:0.0000:know nothing at all, either one way or the other. To the
poems___00wott_0047_28:0.0000:third will belong those poems which we know for certain
poems___00wott_0047_29:0.0250:that Raleigh did not write, chiefly because we can shew
poems___00wott_0047_30:0.0000:that others have a better-founded claim to them.
poems___00wott_0047_31:0.0250:Of the whole number of forty-four poems, we may per-
poems___00wott_0047_32:0.0250:haps arrange twenty-three in the first class, which will leave
poems___00wott_0047_33:0.0000:thirteen for the second, and eight for the third. But each
poems___00wott_0047_34:0.0500:class may be a little enlarged by the addition of scattered
poems___00wott_0048_3:0.0500:Additional Poems in the Oxford edition ; and Jive in the
poems___00wott_0048_32:0.0500:N". xxii is the second poem on Spenser's Faery Queen
poems___00wott_0048_33:0.0250:(see p. 116). As it is tolerably certain, both from the

poems___00wott_0048_35:0.0000:the original edition of Spenser, that they were really written
poems___00wott_0048_36:0.0000:by Sir Walter Raleigh, they may be used as an additional
poems___00wott_0048_37:0.0500:argument to corroborate his claim to the lines on Gascoigne.
poems___00wott_0049_1:0.0500:For though internal evidence, as we have seen, is but a
poems___00wott_0049_2:0.0250:doubtful guide, when we are dealing with such scanty ma-
poems___00wott_0049_3:0.0000:terials, it can scarcely be denied, that the commendation
poems___00wott_0049_4:0.0000:of the Steele-Glass, which has just been quoted, and this
poems___00wott_0049_5:0.0000:second commendation of the Faery Queen, bear a very close
poems___00wott_0049_6:0.0000:resemblance to each other, in the quaint judicial gravity
poems___00wott_0049_7:0.0000:with which the writer in each case sums up the merits of
poems___00wott_0049_8:0.0250:the work before him, and then delivers his "censure"
poems___00wott_0049_30:0.0000:ter; but they are less quaint, and are written in a graver spirit, with a still
poems___00wott_0049_31:0.0000:more pointed application. — It should be remembered, that the name and
poems___00wott_0049_32:0.0000:initials, by which these Commendatory poems are recognized as Raleigh's,
poems___00wott_0049_33:0.0000:receive strong confirmation from his intercourse with the persons so com-
poems___00wott_0049_34:0.0000:mended. Oldys, at least, thought that he had found " the links, if not the
poems___00wott_0049_35:0.0000:perfect chain, of some acquaintance" between Raleigh and Gascoigne : —
poems___00wott_0049_36:0.0000:of his friendship with Spenser, there are ample records: — and Sir Arthur

poems___00wott_0049_38:0.0000:the Islnnd voyage, when he was wounded by his side in the landing at

poems___00wott_0051_8:0.0000:(p. 71); but it was printed more at length in Davison's
poems___00wott_0051_29:0.0250:viz. " A Reporting Sonnet," in Dav. eds. 1602 and 1608; that given

poems___00wott_0051_31:0.0000:d'Amour. The copies in the Phoenix Nest and Le Prince d'Amour are
poems___00wott_0051_32:0.0000:arranged so as to set forth more plainly the intricacies of the poem ; but
poems___00wott_0051_33:0.0000:four of the lines in Davison are altogether omitted, and there are con-
poems___00wott_0051_35:0.0250::; Title in Le Prince d'Amour, " Farewell to the Court." In the Phoenix
poems___00wott_0051_36:0.0000:Nest there is none. The copy in Le Pr. d'Am. is rather mutilated : thus,

poems___00wott_0054_8:0.0000:add one of these last (N". xv), as a specimen of a class of
poems___00wott_0054_9:0.0000:poems which has had considerable influence on Raleigh's
poems___00wott_0054_16:0.0250:* See above, p. xxvii. — I can find only two reasons why these changes
poems___00wott_0054_17:0.0250:were ascribed to Raleigh's wish to be concealed, rather than to the more
poems___00wott_0054_18:0.0000:obvious cause, that the printer found himself mistaken in his original
poems___00wott_0054_19:0.0000:account (see p. 126). The first is the supposed analogy of a similar change
poems___00wott_0054_20:0.0000:in the case of the Reply to Marlow, added to Walton's assertion that
poems___00wott_0054_21:0.0000:Raleigh wrote that poem. The second is the belief that Ignoto was
poems___00wott_0054_22:0.0000:Raleigh's own peculiar signature. As the first is found to rest on an
poems___00wott_0054_23:0.0000:erroneous statement (see p. 136), and as the second has been sufficiently
poems___00wott_0054_24:0.0000:disproved above, we are now driven to the other alternative. But this
poems___00wott_0054_25:0.0000:would be so contrary to Raleigh's claim, that it would almost justify ns in
poems___00wott_0054_26:0.0000:arranging the two poems in the t/iird class. It seems as well, however, to

poems___00wott_0058_10:0.0000:his poetical character become more definite, as the limits of
poems___00wott_0058_11:0.0000:his poetry are more distinctly drawn. In the way in which
poems___00wott_0058_12:0.0000:it has been previously collected, his own peculiar features
poems___00wott_0058_13:0.0000:have been nearly lost, while they were softened down and
poems___00wott_0058_14:0.0250:blended with those common to a whole school of his con-
poems___00wott_0058_15:0.0000:temporaries. The Lee Priory Collection, especially, is cal-
poems___00wott_0058_16:0.0000:culated to give us the most erroneous notions of Raleigh as
poems___00wott_0058_17:0.0000:a poet, — not only because it assigns to him so many poems,
poems___00wott_0058_18:0.0000:amounting to two-thirds of the whole volume, which he never
poems___00wott_0058_19:0.0000:wrote, — but because so many of the most characteristic

poems___00wott_0058_24:0.0000:Brydges expressed with so much eloquence, was not re-
poems___00wott_0058_25:0.0000:warded with better success. I believe some parts of it were

poems___00wott_0063_3:0.0500:must be constantly understood as referring to poems which

poems___00wott_0063_7:0.0000:our first attention. But unfortunately the confusion was
poems___00wott_0063_8:0.0250:increased, instead of lessened, by the manner in which they
poems___00wott_0063_9:0.0000:were committed to the press. In the time of Surrey, they
poems___00wott_0063_10:0.0000:were often set forth on broad-sheets, and then " moralized"
poems___00wott_0063_11:0.0000:by some rhymer of greater zeal than knowledge,— a kind of

poems___00wott_0063_14:0.0000:With that very perishable class of publications we need not

poems___00wott_0064_18:0.0250:clamations and denials often (though not always) followed ;

poems___00wott_0067_12:0.0250:his editor was the aggressor; as in regard to three poems

poems___00wott_0067_28:0.0000:however, ranch less perfect than those in Carew. Mr. Hallam (Introd. to Lit.
poems___00wott_0067_29:0.0250:iii. 43) appears to think this circumstance in Herrick's favour; but surely
poems___00wott_0067_30:0.0000:it tells the other way, for stolen poems were more likely to be mutilated
poems___00wott_0067_31:0.0250:than mended. The best argument for Herrick is found in the dates and
poems___00wott_0067_37:0.0500:Dr. Cotton enters it in his " List" as Donne's (p. 65); and Mr. Todd
poems___00wott_0068_4:0.0000:Instances of the same nature might be multiplied to al-
poems___00wott_0068_5:0.0000:most any extent; J but these are enough to shew, that the
poems___00wott_0068_6:0.0000:insertion of a poem among a writer's collected Works does
poems___00wott_0068_7:0.0000:not always prove him to be the author of it, unless (as in the
poems___00wott_0068_8:0.0000:case of Rel. Wotton.) we have good assurance of the editor's
poems___00wott_0068_9:0.0000:honesty and knowledge. Several subordinate circumstances
poems___00wott_0068_10:0.0000:might be also mentioned, which contribute to weaken our
poems___00wott_0068_11:0.0000:confidence in what we might have hoped to find the surest
poems___00wott_0068_12:0.0000:proof of authorship. Thus at times, a facile writer would
poems___00wott_0068_13:0.0000:help a less ready friend upon occasion, by inditing verses
poems___00wott_0068_14:0.0000:for him ; and the borrower and lender would be easily con-
poems___00wott_0068_15:0.0000:founded. jj A favourite poem, again, often called forth many
poems___00wott_0068_16:0.0000:imitations ; and it is not always possible to distinguish be-
poems___00wott_0068_17:0.0000:tween the original and the copy, — still less to distribute dif-
poems___00wott_0068_18:0.0000:ferent variations on the same original among their respective

poems___00wott_0069_1:0.0250:tions (often for the worse) sometimes sufficed to satisfy the

poems___00wott_0069_10:0.0250:editors, who prefixed each of them to distinct poems, we
poems___00wott_0069_11:0.0250:shall be at no loss to understand how so much confusion
poems___00wott_0069_14:0.0250:think it is not generally known that Sir Edward Dyer has some claim to
poems___00wott_0069_15:0.0000:the original poem. There are three copies of verses on that model; two
poems___00wott_0069_16:0.0000:of which, viz. one of four stanzas and another of six, were printed by Byrd
poems___00wott_0069_17:0.0000:in 1583. They have been reprinted from his text in Cens. Lit. ii. 108-10,
poems___00wott_0069_18:0.0000:and Exc. Tudor, i. 100-3. Percy inserted them in the Reliques with some
poems___00wott_0069_19:0.0000:alterations and additions; but he changed his mind more than once as io

poems___00wott_0069_21:0.0000:(see i. 292-4, 303, ed. 1767 ; and i. 307-10, ed. 1839). The third (containing
poems___00wott_0069_22:0.0000:four stanzas) is among Sylvester's posthumous poems, p. 651 ; and Ellis re-
poems___00wott_0069_23:0.0000:printed it under his name. In Cens. Lit ii, 102, another copy of it is given
poems___00wott_0069_24:0.0000:from a Music Book by Gibbons, 1612. Now the longest, and apparently the
poems___00wott_0069_25:0.0250:earliest, of these poems is signed " E. Dier" in MS. Rawl. Poet. 85, fol. 17.

poems___00wott_0069_29:0.0000:to which reference is commonly made for several of Dyer's unprinted
poems___00wott_0069_30:0.0000:poems, — as by Dr. Bliss, A. 0. i. 743, and apparently by Mr. Dyce, ed. of

poems___00wott_0069_32:0.0000:only person I can recollect who has mentioned this particular poem in the
poems___00wott_0069_33:0.0000:MS.; and he cannot have read more than the first line, for he only says,

poems___00wott_0069_35:0.0250:(2.) Because it is quite possible that Dyer wrote many extant poems of
poems___00wott_0069_36:0.0000:which he is not known to be the author; for, as Mr. Dyce says, none of
poems___00wott_0069_37:0.0000:his (achwwledged) productions " have descended to our times that seem to
poems___00wott_0069_38:0.0000:justify the contemporary applause which he received." (3.) Because I

poems___00wott_0072_16:0.0000:should make us all the more careful, when no evidence is
poems___00wott_0072_17:0.0000:given. We need not doubt, for instance, that Raleigh, like
poems___00wott_0072_18:0.0000:Tychbourne,* wrote a few brief lines the night before his
poems___00wott_0072_19:0.0000:execution (p. 75) ; but when four poems of much greater

poems___00wott_0072_26:0.0000:seems likely to prove fatal ; and of this we have numerous
poems___00wott_0072_27:0.0000:examples. Thus Sir Henry Wotton, after an attack of fe-

poems___00wott_0073_11:0.0000:to involve the denial of a writer's claim. But it does not
poems___00wott_0073_12:0.0000:follow that a person never wrote a poem at all, because it
poems___00wott_0073_13:0.0000:can be proved that he did not write it at a particular time.

poems___00wott_0073_19:0.0000:" Soulknil" was written in extremity of sickness, he did
poems___00wott_0073_20:0.0250:not mean to deny that Vaux and Edwards really wrote the
poems___00wott_0073_21:0.0500:poems ; and he has been followed by our various antiqua-

poems___00wott_0073_26:0.0000:version of them, not because they are genuine,— for as Sidney's parents
poems___00wott_0073_27:0.0000:died a short time before him, the tifth line contains a plain proof of for-
poems___00wott_0073_28:0.0000:gery, — but because they form an apt illustration of these traditions in ge-
poems___00wott_0073_29:0.0250:neral, and because I cannot find that they are mentioned by Zouch or

poems___00wott_0074_5:0.0000:These two traditions seem precisely parallel to that an-

poems___00wott_0076_14:0.0250:I think, the last subject which seems to require notice here.
poems___00wott_0076_15:0.0250:When a writer has conducted his own compositions through

poems___00wott_0076_24:0.0250:qualifications of a faithful and affectionate biographer, it is
poems___00wott_0076_25:0.0000:plain that, as an editor, he cannot always claim the merit of
poems___00wott_0076_26:0.0000:minute and scrupulous fidelity in transcription. Otherwise,
poems___00wott_0076_27:0.0250:we should not have found so many variations between the
poems___00wott_0076_28:0.0250:different copies of poems which he published in different
poems___00wott_0076_29:0.0000:places ; nor would there have been so much agreement in
poems___00wott_0076_30:0.0250:rejected readings as we sometimes observe in copies ob-
poems___00wott_0076_31:0.0000:tained from other sources. It is scarcely necessary to re-
poems___00wott_0076_32:0.0250:mark, however, that the best reading (or what seems to be
poems___00wott_0076_33:0.0250:such) is not always the most genuine ; and the advantages

poems___00wott_0087_10:0.0000:him for a poet;— the story of his " polishing" Ben Jonson

poems___00wott_0087_14:0.0000:is certain, however, that Hoskins was familiar with many of
poems___00wott_0087_15:0.0000:his more eminent contemporaries. Wood says that " he was

poems___00wott_0105_12:0.0000:that the above verses were collected into Reliquiee Wotton-
poems___00wott_0105_13:0.0000:ianse, and bear a denotation of having been addressed to

poems___00wott_0105_15:0.0000:notations are of doubtful authority, and that the first edition
poems___00wott_0105_16:0.0000:of the Reliquiae gave it no earlier appropriation than Bacon's

poems___00wott_0106_1:0.0250:title in Rel. Wotton. does not say that it was '^addressed to
poems___00wott_0106_2:0.0000:the earl of Somerset," but that it was written " upon his
poems___00wott_0106_3:0.0000:sudden restraint:" — but there are graver faults in the pas-
poems___00wott_0106_4:0.0000:sage ; for first, the assertion that the " denotations" of Rel.
poems___00wott_0106_5:0.0250:Wotton. " are of doubtful authority," is evidently made at
poems___00wott_0106_6:0.0000:random. Park shewed that he had not read that volume
poems___00wott_0106_7:0.0000:with much care, when he forgot that it contained the Poem,

poems___00wott_0106_12:0.0000:Poetical part is pointed out. — Next, the publication of both
poems___00wott_0106_13:0.0000:books in 1651 goes for nothing ; as the one was prepared by
poems___00wott_0106_14:0.0000:Izaak Walton, with Sir Henry's own papers in his hands ;
poems___00wott_0106_15:0.0000:while the other was an unauthorized translation of Bacon's

poems___00wott_0106_18:0.0000:lines might be made to apply to Bacon, on the ground that
poems___00wott_0106_19:0.0000:his submission and consequent fall arose from obedience to

poems___00wott_0126_2:0.0000:to put an end to the theory which is so strangely founded on

poems___00wott_0126_9:0.0000:besides the omission of a whole stanza, is inferior to that of

poems___00wott_0135_11:0.0250:company." When the "repetition" is concluded, Piscator
poems___00wott_0135_12:0.0000:says, " Trust me (Scholer) I thank you heartily for these

poems___00wott_0136_10:0.0000:argument which will scarcely stand. Yet Sir Egerton gives
poems___00wott_0136_11:0.0000:no other evidence, except the signature Ignoto in Rel. Wot-
poems___00wott_0136_12:0.0000:ton., — evidence, however, which he thought so conclusive,
poems___00wott_0136_13:0.0250:that he claims for Raleigh all the other pieces in Rel. Wot-
poems___00wott_0136_14:0.0000:ton. which are marked in the same way. Now even if this
poems___00wott_0136_15:0.0000:word Ignoto were admitted to be a "slight designation of"
poems___00wott_0136_16:0.0000:Raleigh's " property" (as Ellis calls it) in the earlier Mis-

poems___00wott_0136_20:0.0000:not Wotton's, in the passage which I have cited above. It is
poems___00wott_0136_21:0.0000:evident, that Walton placed the piece among the doubtful
poems___00wott_0136_22:0.0000:poems when he edited Rel. Wotton., because he had no
poems___00wott_0136_23:0.0000:positive proof that Wotton wrote it; but it is equally evi-

poems___00wott_0170_6:0.0500:Those who took the piece as Raleigh's editors have given

poems___00wott_0170_21:0.0000:Brydges ?"f For this conjecture, we are probably indebted

poems___00wott_0170_23:0.0000:stance, that Gascoigne ridiculed those who fancied, that

poems___00wott_0171_15:0.0000:count; for he was then only about eighteen. But it might
poems___00wott_0171_16:0.0000:be urged, that he was admitted a member of Gray's Inn in
poems___00wott_0171_17:0.0000:that same year, and in the very next year, became confessedly
poems___00wott_0171_18:0.0000:an author.^ The former reason, however, is sufficient to

poems___00wott_0172_3:0.0500:Campbell says, " whoever looks at the folio vol. of Sylves-
poems___00wott_0172_4:0.0000:ter's poems, will see that Joshua uses the beautiful original
poems___00wott_0172_5:0.0000:merely as a text, and has the conscience to print* his own
poems___00wott_0172_6:0.0000:stuff in a way that shows it to be interpolated." Doubtless
poems___00wott_0172_7:0.0000:every one will be of Mr. Campbell's opinion, supported as

poems___00wott_0172_14:0.0000:mutilated and imperfect, though not to so shameful a degree ;
poems___00wott_0172_15:0.0000:and the character of the volume is so notorious, that I be-
poems___00wott_0172_16:0.0250:lieve none of those who have had occasion to mention it
poems___00wott_0172_17:0.0500:* Not so; but it was bad enough to write it, — if indeed Sylvester was
poems___00wott_0172_18:0.0250:really guilty of it, which may be charitably doubted . He died in 1618 : and
poems___00wott_0172_19:0.0000:in the vol. of 1641, the piece is placed among the " Posthumi . . . Never
poems___00wott_0172_20:0.0000:till now Imprinted." — Others have written bad variations on the poem, as
poems___00wott_0172_21:0.0000:may be seen from Percy's letter, quoted above, — from one of the copies
poems___00wott_0172_22:0.0000:printed by Sir H. Nicolas from the MSS. in Brit. Mus., — and from that
poems___00wott_0172_23:0.0000:in the Chetham MS. mentioned below. There have been sundry imitations
poems___00wott_0172_24:0.0500:of it in later times, two of which occur in one vol. of "The New Foundling
poems___00wott_0172_26:0.0500:+ See Hist. Lit. Cent. XVI. ii. 126, ed. 1843. In a note, Mr. Hallam
poems___00wott_0172_27:0.0000:says," Brydges gives it to Raleigh without evidence, and we may add,
poems___00wott_0172_28:0.0000:without probability." — " Without evidence," certainly ; for he has not ad-
poems___00wott_0172_29:0.0000:duced a particle. That which is quoted above was altogether unknown to
poems___00wott_0172_30:0.0000:Lira. But why "without probability"? Raleigh was 41 years old in
poems___00wott_0172_31:0.0000:1593, the earliest date to which the poem has been traced ; he had written
poems___00wott_0172_32:0.0000:verses in 1576; and as to the subject of the piece, surely it is not neces-
poems___00wott_0172_33:0.0000:sary that a Christian man should be on the poiht of dying, before he will
poems___00wott_0172_34:0.0000:fix his thoughts on death. Others have made too much of the internal
poems___00wott_0172_35:0.0000:evidence when they thought it sufficient to prove Raleigh's title; but it
poems___00wott_0172_36:0.0000:can scarcely be urged against him. Mr. Hallam says, that the poem is
poems___00wott_0172_37:0.0000:" characterised by strength, condensation, and simplicity ;" and that " such
poems___00wott_0172_38:0.0250:poems as this could only be written by a man who had seen and thought
poems___00wott_0173_2:0.0500:Nor would it be possible to do so ; for he was not born till
poems___00wott_0173_3:0.0250:1580. It must, therefore, be resigned with the preceding
poems___00wott_0173_7:0.0250:be insufficient, unless we can produce some positive testi-
poems___00wott_0173_8:0.0250:mony in Raleigh's favour, which is free from the suspicion
poems___00wott_0173_9:0.0000:felt towards witnesses, of whose statement one part has been
poems___00wott_0173_10:0.0000:shown to be inaccurate. Such the following piece must be
poems___00wott_0173_11:0.0500:allowed to be. It is here printed from an old MS. Miscel-
poems___00wott_0175_1:0.0500:In these verses, three points especially deserve attention ;
poems___00wott_0175_2:0.0250:first, that they assign the disputed Poem to Raleigh byname ; *
poems___00wott_0175_3:0.0000:— next, that they were written when he was still alive, as is
poems___00wott_0175_4:0.0000:plain from the concluding stanzas ; — and lastly, that they
poems___00wott_0175_5:0.0000:give the reason why it has been found so difficult to discover

poems___00wott_0175_9:0.0250:But this is not the only answer to the Poem which can be
poems___00wott_0175_10:0.0250:found among contemporary MSS. In one of the Ashmo-
poems___00wott_0175_11:0.0250:lean MSS. (781, p. 164,) there are two short pieces which
poems___00wott_0175_12:0.0250:clearly bear upon this point; but as they have been printed
poems___00wott_0175_13:0.0000:at length among the Additional Poems in the Oxford edition
poems___00wott_0175_14:0.0500:of Raleigh's Works, f I need only cite a part of them. The
poems___00wott_0175_15:0.0500:first is entitled "The Answre to the Lye," and begins and
poems___00wott_0175_23:0.0500:the first couplet. So far, we have no name of any kind.
poems___00wott_0175_28:0.0000:name," says Mr. D'Israeli," was spelt by himself and by his contemporaries

poems___00wott_0175_32:0.0000:Papers, Camd. Soc. p. 94. He generally wrote it " Ralegh."

poems___00wott_0175_35:0.0000:Raleigh wrote them both, which is absurd ; and are not in any way con-
poems___00wott_0175_36:0.0250:nected with " The Lie," which makes them useless. The first of them pro-
poems___00wott_0175_37:0.0500:bably gave Ritsoo his erroneous title.
poems___00wott_0176_6:0.0000:ous that the first of these is an attack upon the present Poem,
poems___00wott_0176_7:0.0000:and the second a defence of it. It may be very doubtful
poems___00wott_0176_8:0.0000:whether the defence was really written by Raleigh, but the
poems___00wott_0176_9:0.0000:transcriber who assigned it to him evidently thought he had
poems___00wott_0176_10:0.0000:an Author's right of appearing in behalf of his own produc-
poems___00wott_0176_11:0.0000:tion. And here, again, our evidence is not injured by the
poems___00wott_0176_12:0.0000:presence of the tradition, since it must have been believed
poems___00wott_0176_13:0.0250:that he survived the composition of " The Lie" long enough
poems___00wott_0176_17:0.0000:Raleigh." (p. 103.) This is a slight addition to our evi-
poems___00wott_0176_18:0.0250:dence ; for though the authority of these old MS. Collections
poems___00wott_0176_19:0.0250:is not generally very high, the compiler of this volume ap-
poems___00wott_0176_20:0.0250:pears to have been sufficiently acquainted with contemporary
poems___00wott_0176_21:0.0000:literature to have the right of offering at least corroborating
poems___00wott_0176_22:0.0250:proof; for he has copied some of Raleigh's letters, and va-
poems___00wott_0176_23:0.0250:rious poems by Hoskins, Donne, Christopher Brooke (?),
poems___00wott_0176_24:0.0250:Francis Davison, and others, which were not printed till long
poems___00wott_0176_25:0.0250:after, — some not till very lately, and (I think) some few not

poems___00wott_0176_30:0.0000:and several of Davison's Psalms at the end of the volume. As these last
poems___00wott_0176_31:0.0000:are also anonymous, Mr. Halliwell, in his description of the Chetham MSS.,
poems___00wott_0176_32:0.0000:merely terms them " a collection of psalms." He ascribes the volume (which
poems___00wott_0176_33:0.0000:formerly belonged to Dr. Farmer) to " the time of James I." I do not, how-
poems___00wott_0176_34:0.0000:ever, lay much stress on this signature; tirst, because the compiler may have
poems___00wott_0176_35:0.0250:taken it from the Reply, though he has spelt it differently; next, because
poems___00wott_0176_36:0.0500:the Poem has an interpolated verse; and lastly, because the transcriber's ac-
poems___00wott_0177_1:0.0250:On Raleigh's side, then, (to say no more of this, or any
poems___00wott_0177_2:0.0000:other minor proofs, — such as the name appended in various
poems___00wott_0177_3:0.0000:Collections of later date and no authority,) we have two
poems___00wott_0177_4:0.0000:Answers to the Poem, both written while he was still alive : —
poems___00wott_0177_5:0.0000:in the one, he is expressly mentioned as the Author of "The
poems___00wott_0177_6:0.0000:Lie ;" — on the same page which preserves the other, he is
poems___00wott_0177_7:0.0000:connected with it almost as closely, by being represented as
poems___00wott_0177_8:0.0000:undertaking its defence. On the other side, we have five
poems___00wott_0177_9:0.0000:other claimants, whose cases will not bear examination, and
poems___00wott_0177_10:0.0000:the convicted falsehood of a foolish tradition, which would
poems___00wott_0177_11:0.0000:almost have refuted itself. — Those who have more ample op-
poems___00wott_0177_12:0.0250:portunities of examining the minor literature of that period
poems___00wott_0177_13:0.0000:than I can command, may probably find much more that
poems___00wott_0177_14:0.0250:bears upon the subject. I have only been anxious to escape
poems___00wott_0177_15:0.0000:the censure which Mr. Campbell passed on those who had
poems___00wott_0177_16:0.0250:previously printed it as Raleigh's, '* without a tittle of evi-
poems___00wott_0177_17:0.0000:dence to show that it was the production of that great man."
poems___00wott_0177_18:0.0250:If it be once conceded that Raleigh wrote it, the manner
poems___00wott_0177_19:0.0000:in which the tradition arose will be easily explained. It
poems___00wott_0177_20:0.0000:seems that he really composed one short piece, if not a se-
poems___00wott_0177_21:0.0000:cond, the very night before his execution (see above, p. 74) ;
poems___00wott_0177_22:0.0000:the rumour of these would soon be spread abroad ; — the
poems___00wott_0177_23:0.0250:popular love for prison-verses would give ample encourage-
poems___00wott_0177_24:0.0000:ment to conjectures on their nature; — and any moral piece
poems___00wott_0177_25:0.0000:which he had previously written, and in which the near ap-
poems___00wott_0177_26:0.0000:proach of death was dwelt on, would be eagerly caught
poems___00wott_0177_27:0.0000:up, and represented as his dying meditation, by those who
poems___00wott_0177_28:0.0000:had neither time nor inclination to be exact in their dates.
poems___00wott_0177_29:0.0250:Hence it happens, that besides those two short pieces, there
poems___00wott_0177_30:0.0250:are no less than four long poems, which have been assigned
poems___00wott_0177_32:0.0250:quaintance with contemporary literature, which I have assiinicd above, might
poems___00wott_0177_33:0.0500:be denied on the ground, that had he known the writers of the pieces just
poems___00wott_0177_34:0.0000:mentioned, he would have named them. I have not been able to examine
poems___00wott_0178_2:0.0250:other two, — "The Lie," and "The Pilgrimage," — he was
poems___00wott_0178_3:0.0250:probably the Author, but certainly not at the time recorded.

poems___00wott_0185_13:0.0000:verent, we should recollect the circumstances under which
poems___00wott_0185_14:0.0000:they were probably composed. At such a period, when the
poems___00wott_0185_15:0.0000:perspective through which we view things must be altogether
poems___00wott_0185_16:0.0000:changed, the familiar distinctions between small and great

poems___00wott_0185_18:0.0000:relative to us ; and a man of bold and ardent spirit, which
poems___00wott_0185_19:0.0000:had not then been broken dow^n by long imprisonment,
poems___00wott_0185_20:0.0000:might give vent, in strange and startling metaphors, to those
poems___00wott_0185_21:0.0250:strong feelings of mingled confidence and indignation, which
poems___00wott_0185_22:0.0000:could find no outlet in more ordinary language.

poems___00wott_0190_12:0.0250:3. In SirH. Nicolas's noble reprint of Walton, we find a
poems___00wott_0190_13:0.0000:note upon the poem ; — " These verses are also said to have
poems___00wott_0190_14:0.0000:been written by Sir Walter Raleigh, when a prisoner in
poems___00wott_0190_15:0.0000:the Tower, shortly before his execution. Walton expresses
poems___00wott_0190_16:0.0000:himself doubtful as to the author." (p. 311.) This tradi-
poems___00wott_0190_17:0.0000:tion, which really seems to haunt us, has done Raleigh little
poems___00wott_0190_18:0.0000:service. It has nearly deprived him, as we have seen, of
poems___00wott_0190_19:0.0000:one poem, which I believe he really wrote ; and there can
poems___00wott_0190_20:0.0250:be no doubt that it is a mistake in this case also. He may
poems___00wott_0190_21:0.0000:have written the piece at some other time; but I do not
poems___00wott_0190_22:0.0500:know on what authority it is ascribed to him at all.

poems___00wott_0205_24:0.0250:of No. 71. (p. 161.) " The Shepheard's Description of Loue" (N". 54) is as-
poems___00wott_0206_1:0.0250:been done, as Ritson observes, either because Raleigh was
poems___00wott_0206_2:0.0000:not the author, or because he wished to be concealed. The
poems___00wott_0206_3:0.0000:first would be the more natural explanation; but the second
poems___00wott_0206_4:0.0000:has been more generally adopted, because Izaak Walton,
poems___00wott_0206_5:0.0000:who has inserted in his Complete Angler both Marlow's
poems___00wott_0206_6:0.0000:Poem and this Reply, speaks of the latter as " an answer to
poems___00wott_0206_7:0.0000:it which was made hy Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger
poems___00wott_0206_8:0.0000:daies." The former he describes as " that smooth song
poems___00wott_0206_9:0.0250:which was made by Kit. Marlow/zow; at least fifty yeers ago.''*
poems___00wott_0206_10:0.0000:It may be remarked, in passing, that this second hypothesis
poems___00wott_0206_11:0.0000:is scarcely consistent with the notion that Jgnoto was Raleigh's
poems___00wott_0206_12:0.0000:peculiar signature; though some persons have gladly em-
poems___00wott_0206_13:0.0000:braced both, for the sake of widening the range of poems
poems___00wott_0206_14:0.0000:ascribed to him. If ever that word ceased to mean simply
poems___00wott_0206_15:0.0250:Anonymous, of course it ceased to be indefinite enough for
poems___00wott_0206_16:0.0500:the purpose of concealment.
poems___00wott_0206_17:0.0250:As so much reliance is placed in Walton's casual asser-
poems___00wott_0206_18:0.0000:tion, it should be observed, that the passage is scarcely ac-
poems___00wott_0206_19:0.0000:curate enough in other respects to warrant such implicit
poems___00wott_0206_20:0.0000:confidence. When the first edition of the Angler was pub-
poems___00wott_0206_21:0.0000:lished (1653), Marlow had been dead sixty years; and at
poems___00wott_0206_22:0.0250:the time of his death, Raleigh, whose "younger dales" are
poems___00wott_0206_23:0.0000:so expressly mentioned, was forty-one years old. This leads
poems___00wott_0206_24:0.0000:us to suspect, that W'alton took his date from the title-page
poems___00wott_0206_25:0.0500:of Eno-land's Helicon ; and there is at least one other in-
poems___00wott_0206_26:0.0500:• CoiDpl. Angl. p. 105, ed. 1655. There art five poems altogether which
poems___00wott_0206_27:0.0500:were framed on this model. 1. The original song, ascribed to Marlow.
poems___00wott_0206_28:0.0000:2. The answer printed above. 3. An imitation, also in Engl. Helicon,
poems___00wott_0206_29:0.0000:signed Ignoto, — and for that reason given by some to Raleigh (as by War-
poems___00wott_0206_30:0.0000:ton, iii. 354, ed. 1840, and Brydges). 4. Another by Donne, Poems, p.

poems___00wott_0206_35:0.0000:Tytler,pp. 22, 108. Mr. Collier also admits his claim (Shakesp. viii. 561,
poems___00wott_0207_1:0.0250:stance, in which he seems to have contented himself, in like
poems___00wott_0207_2:0.0000:manner, with the date of a publication.* If this was the
poems___00wott_0207_3:0.0000:case, we should see good reason for assenting to the opinion
poems___00wott_0207_4:0.0000:of Sir H. Nicolas, that Walton gave the present piece to
poems___00wott_0207_5:0.0000:Raleigh, merely because he " used a copy in which the al-
poems___00wott_0207_6:0.0000:teration [of the signature, — from W. R. to Ignoto] had not
poems___00wott_0207_7:0.0000:been made." Had he stated that Raleigh wrote the Poem,
poems___00wott_0207_8:0.0000:as the result of his own enquiries on a point of some uncer-
poems___00wott_0207_9:0.0000:tainty, his authority would have been most weighty ; but it
poems___00wott_0207_10:0.0000:is doubtful whether we can build so much upon it, in a case
poems___00wott_0207_11:0.0250:where he seems to have merely acquiesced in the statement
poems___00wott_0207_12:0.0500:which he found before him.
poems___00wott_0207_13:0.0250:For these reasons, it seems that Raleigh's claim to the
poems___00wott_0207_14:0.0000:Poem is not so certain as some have thought ; but after all,
poems___00wott_0207_15:0.0000:I should be sorry to believe that Walton was mistaken. In
poems___00wott_0207_16:0.0250:a case of this kind, the general consent in Raleigh's favour
poems___00wott_0207_17:0.0000:must be allowed due weight. There is a great difference,
poems___00wott_0207_18:0.0000:too, between the mere absence of positive evidence, as in this

poems___00wott_0207_20:0.0250:others.
poems___00wott_0207_25:0.0250:years ago." (C. A. p. 165, ed. 1655. It was not so in the first ed.) Sir H.
poems___00wott_0207_26:0.0000:Nicolas supposes that Walton took the date (in round numbers) from the
poems___00wott_0207_27:0.0250:third ed. of Davison, 1611, overlookingthose of 1602 and 1G08. Asthissong
poems___00wott_0207_28:0.0000:was by A. W. Walton's remark is one of the evidences tending to iden-
poems___00wott_0207_29:0.0000:tify A. W. with Davison himself. See Nicolas's ed. of C. A. p. 164, and
poems___00wott_0207_30:0.0000:of Davison, pp. cxxvii. 250. The supposition that Walton calculated from
poems___00wott_0207_31:0.0000:the tide-pages seems more probable in both cases than tiiat the passages
poems___00wott_0207_32:0.0000:were written some years before the Angler was published. With respect
poems___00wott_0207_33:0.0000:to remarks introduced so incidentally, we should recollect, as a foreign critic
poems___00wott_0207_34:0.0000:judiciously tells us to do in the case of historical narrations, " Quam seepe

poems___00wott_0216_12:0.0250:Reply to Marlow (Sign. A a 2) is simply Ignoto, and it has never been
poems___00wott_0216_13:0.0000:disturbed. As Ellis distinctly referred to that copy, it is plain that he was
poems___00wott_0216_14:0.0000:mistaken in affirming, that it was in that case pasted over the initials W. R.
poems___00wott_0216_15:0.0000:Raleigh's claim to the poem rests, therefore, on Walton's authority, which,
poems___00wott_0216_16:0.0000:as I have remarked, becomes more important, when we are compelled to

poems___00wott_0216_18:0.0000:cases of substitution mentioned in the next note are correctly reported, —

poems___00wott_0216_20:0.0000:(Sign. L 3) completely obliterates the former signature; and we must
poems___00wott_0216_21:0.0000:therefore suppose, that the fact of its being " S. W. R." has been learnt
poems___00wott_0216_22:0.0000:from an examination of other copies. With three other alterations which
poems___00wott_0216_23:0.0250:have been made in that same volume (Sign. H, — O 4, — and P) Raleigh is
poems___00wott_0216_27:0.0000:by Abp. Sancroft, and knosvn as MS.Tann. 465, I may take this opportii-
poems___00wott_0216_28:0.0000:nilj- of remarking, that besides the larger book of extracts, which must
poems___00wott_0216_29:0.0000:always be understood by the references in this vol., there is a smaller col-
poems___00wott_0216_30:0.0000:lection, also in Sancroft's writing, and belonging to the same parcel; but it
poems___00wott_0216_31:0.0000:is of less value than the other, because the extracts are almost entirely taken
poems___00wott_0216_32:0.0000:from printed books. It was in this smaller bundle of papers (at pp. 34, 60)
poems___00wott_0216_33:0.0000:that Warton found the transcripts of one of Milton's Psalms, and of his
poems___00wott_0216_34:0.0000:Hymn on the Nativity, which he mentioned in the Pref. to his ed. of Mil-
poems___00wott_0216_35:0.0000:ton's Minor Poems (pp. v,vi); and which D'oyly could not (ind (Life of
poems___00wott_0216_36:0.0000:Saner, i. 21, n.). But the date which Warton assigns to these transcripts
poems___00wott_0216_37:0.0000:("about the year 1648") cannot be correct; for in an earlier part of the
poems___00wott_0216_38:0.0000:same MS. Sancroft has copied several poems from Rel. Wotton. ed. 1651, to
poems___00wott_0216_39:0.0000:the pagination of which he refers exactly, even when it is obviously erro-
poems___00wott_0216_40:0.0250:neous. (Those poems are N^^. x, xiii,and xiv in Part I, copied on pp. 2,
poems___00wott_0216_41:0.0000:25; and N^^. ii and iii in Part II, copied on pp. 4, 5.) This may have
poems___00wott_0216_42:0.0250:some influence on the date which I have given on p. 22 (after Warton, as
poems___00wott_0216_43:0.0000:I thought) to the larger MS. It was in the smaller MS. (p. 48) that Ma-
poems___00wott_0216_44:0.0000:lone found the imperfect copy of Alabaster's Sonnets, which is printed in

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_1:0.0250:PREFACE
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_4:0.0250:Eoyal Highness would greatly excite the Oriental
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_6:0.0250:posed in his honour. Poreseeing that these com-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_7:0.0000:positions would prove interesting, not only on
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_8:0.0000:account of their peculiar Oriental character, but
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_9:0.0000:also as spontaneous expressions of the sentiments
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_10:0.0500:and feelings of the educated classes in India
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_11:0.0250:towards the Eoyal Pamily, it was thought de-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_12:0.0000:sirable to offer prizes to the extent of One
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_13:0.0000:Hundred Guineas for a limited number of the
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_14:0.0250:best poems, in English or in any Indian language,-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_16:0.0500:complish this the Proprietor of The Crown Per-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_17:0.0250:fumery Company of London took the initiative,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_18:0.0500:and his offer was extensively announced in this
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_19:0.0250:country and throughout Hindustan. The result is
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_21:0.0000:received — more than one-third of the number from
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_22:0.0250:Indian authors — in Hindustani, Teliigu, Tamil,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_23:0.0500:Bengali, Sanskrit, Gujerati, Mahratti, Hindi, etc.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_24:0.0250:It may be added that these poems have been written
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0008_26:0.0000:Sudras, Rajpoots, Mahommedans, and various types
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_0:0.0000:VI PEEPACE.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_2:0.0250:A few of the Indian poems are in English, and it
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_3:0.0250:is a fact worthy of note that two Indian prizes
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_4:0.0000:awarded for them were taken by English poems
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_5:0.0250:written by natives of India. The verses of Mr.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_6:0.0000:Chuteesh Chunder Dutt £uid Mr. Eam Sharma
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_7:0.0500:will be read with interest. Among the four other
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_8:0.0500:Indian poems in this volume, two are published
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_9:0.0500:both in the original and in the English transla-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_10:0.0000:tions, precisely as furnished by the writers them-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_11:0.0500:selves. The remaining are the two in Sanskrit
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_12:0.0250:and Hindustani respectively, portions of which have
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_13:0.0000:already appeared in The AthentBum, in which the
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_14:0.0000:Prince of Wales is spoken of as a veritable Deity.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_15:0.0250:Of the English compositions it is not necessary
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_16:0.0250:to speak. All the poems published in this
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_17:0.0250:volume have received either prizes or honourable
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_18:0.0000:mention. The prizes have been adjudged, as
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_19:0.0000:previously announced, by an eminent body of
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_20:0.0000:competent scholars, and the poems are printed —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_21:0.0000:though not in the order of the awards — as nearly
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_22:0.0500:as possible, both in the originals and translations,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0009_24:0.0500:by the writers. The book is offered without pre-

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_1:0.0500:The poet who has composed this " Prince of Wales* Fearl
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_2:0.0000:or Star Necklace** is a great Telugu scholar, of wide repu-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_3:0.0000:tation, and is unrivalled in his mastery over the Telugu
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_4:0.0000:language (one of the two most important languages of the
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_5:0.0000:Presidency of Madras). A prose work by the pen of this
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_6:0.0000:learned author is now made a text-book in Telugu for the
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_7:0.0000:First Examination in Arts of the Madras University. The
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_8:0.0000:works of this poet, both Sanscrit and Telugu, which are
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_9:0.0000:not a few, are well known in India, especially in this
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_10:0.0000:Presidency. This poet is the proprietor and editor of a
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_11:0.0250:monthly Telugu periodical, namely, ** Andhra Bhasha Sunjee-
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_12:0.0000:vanC* This periodical may be called the Spectator of
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_13:0.0000:Southern India, because its masterly articles are likely to
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_14:0.0000:be made text-books for the B.A. degree Examination of
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_15:0.0000:the Madras University. Owing to this poet, the Telugu
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_16:0.0000:language may be said to have come to a prosperity, similar
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_17:0.0000:to that attained by it in the reign of Krishnatheva Eayaloo,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_18:0.0000:a king of Northern Camatic. This is the opinion of many
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_19:0.0000:wise men. The composition is excellent and laconic. Of
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0059_20:0.0000:this poem it may be said that ^^more is meant than meets

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_11:0.0000:in English, such as " God Save the Queen," etc. The word
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_12:0.0000:Tharavali has two meanings — 1st, It means a necklace of
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_13:0.0000:twenty-seven pearls; hence there are twenty-seven stanzas.

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_15:0.0000:which surround the Moon, according to Hindu astronomy,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_16:0.0000:hence the name. The chief object of the poet in thus
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_17:0.0000:heading the poem is that these represent the Star of India
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_18:0.0250:titles (K.G.C.S.I., K.C.S.I., C.S.I., etc.), which the Prince,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0068_25:0.0000:poetry, like the Saxon, is of an alliterative nature. These stanzas

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_4:0.0500:nine conflicts anywhere recorded in history occurred

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_9:0.0250:movement in the direction of the stampede by the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_10:0.0000:animals of a half dozen butcher carts. For fifteen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_11:0.0000:minutes the street was in an agonizing uproar, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_12:0.0000:excited men deliberately walked over each other in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_13:0.0000:attempting to catch glimpses of the belligerent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_14:0.0000:brutes, as the tide of battle carried them from one
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_15:0.0000:side of the thoroughfare to the other, against the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_16:0.0250:heels of kicking horses and under the wheels of

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_22:0.0500:gory of literature we humbly class the above will
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_23:0.0250:not permit us to give the result of the encounter in

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0273_24:0.0000:a number of miscellaneous books. The whole regiment was the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0273_25:0.0000:recipient of her hospitality on many occasions, at Pittsfield, and

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0275_21:0.0000:Kegiment was also there. Colonel Ward had been in active ser-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0275_22:0.0250:vice, and the artificial leg which he wore testified that he had
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0275_23:0.0250:been to the front. He afterwards returned to active duty, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0275_24:0.0250:eventually fell in battle.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_10:0.0500:regiment as Field Officer. At the battle of Ball's Bluff he showed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_11:0.0000:great bravery and skill, and succeeded in bringing off from the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_12:0.0000:field a small remnant of his men, crossing the river himself in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_13:0.0000:the last boat, after seeing his command safely out of the clutches
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_14:0.0000:of the enemy. While before Yorktown he received a wound in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_15:0.0000:his leg, requiring amputation above the knee. Subsequently he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_16:0.0000:was appointed Commandant of the post at Camp Briggs, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_17:0.0000:although an entire stranger to the officers of the Forty-ninth, so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_18:0.0000:favorably impressed them, that they chose him as their Colonel.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_19:0.0000:He served with the regiment, and was severely wounded in the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_20:0.0000:attack on Port Hudson, May 27, 1863. After the Forty-ninth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_21:0.0000:was mustered out, he became Colonel of the Fifty-seventh, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_22:0.0000:served under Grant in the long campaign of 1864-5 against Rich-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_23:0.0000:mond. He was wounded at the battle of the "Wilderness, and for
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_24:0.0000:his bravery promoted to be Brigadier-General. At the attack on
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_25:0.0250:Petersburgh, at the time of the explosion of the mine, General
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_26:0.0000:Bartlett was captured, and was a prisoner in the hands of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_27:0.0000:enemy for some time. At the close of the war, he was brevetted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_28:0.0000:a Major-General, at the age of twenty-five, a most merited com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_29:0.0000:pliment, most fitly bestowed at the termination of so remarkable
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_30:0.0500:and brilliant a career. He has since died of diseases contracted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_25:0.0500:steen, but to the rascal who contracted to feed the troops on Long

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_24:0.0000:were posted up in the stalls which they had respectively occu-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_25:0.0250:pied ; and the use to which these accommodations had come to be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_26:0.0000:appropriated, was matter of considerable remark and merriment.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_19:0.0000:one genius. Several officers had a hand in its production. In
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_20:0.0000:fact, nearly half of it was written before we were invited to take a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_21:0.0000:share in the intellectual effort necessary for its completion. The
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_22:0.0000:several authors would prefer not to publish their names, but we
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_23:0.0000:are bound to state that the regiment could boast a good deal of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_24:0.0000:undeveloped poetical talent. The ballad was read by a great
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_25:0.0000:many within and without the regiment at the time it was written,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_26:0.0000:and we are glad to put it in shape for preservation, after elimi-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_27:0.0500:nating some local allusions and hits, the printing of which would

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_18:0.0000:something tremendous. It was strictly forbidden in orders from
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_19:0.0000:Headquarters ; but hunger knows no law, and officers were obliged
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_20:0.0000:to wink at some depredations upon private property in the ene-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_21:0.0250:my's country, especially as an occasional rare bit thereby found
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_22:0.0000:its way into their own mess. .
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_23:0.0000:f There was heavy cannonading during the night, as Farragut
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_24:0.0250:was attempting to pass the batteries on the river, and did succeed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_25:0.0000:in passing Port Hudson with the Flagship Hartford, and the Al-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_26:0.0000:batross, The head of our column was also near enough to Port
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_27:0.0250:Hudson to make some demonstration on land, and divert as much
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_28:0.0000:as possible the attention of the enemy from Farragut's operations.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_15:0.0000:tions of Port Hudson. The explosion of our gunboat, Mississippi^
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_16:0.0000:on the river, lighted up our camp with the glare of d.iy : and the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_17:0.0000:report, which was not heard until the lapse of a minute, as it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_18:0.0000:seemed, was terrific. This was about three o'clock in the morn-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_19:0.0000:ing, and an order coming nearly simultaneously, to fall in, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_20:0.0250:march back the way we came, created a temporary panic which
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_21:0.0000:is cursorily described in the verses which follow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_22:0.0250:* Colonel Chapin, of the One Hundred and Sixteenth New York,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_23:0.0000:Commander of our brigade ; and, as is hinted, an inveterate drill-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_24:0.0000:er thereof. He was a brave and faithful officer, and was killed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_25:0.0250:at the storming of Port Hudson, on the 27th of May. President
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_26:0.0500:Lincoln appointed him Brigadier-General, of date the day of his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_27:0.0500:death.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_21:0.0500:the regiment seemed to feel great apprehension, lest some other
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_22:0.0000:had been grown the year before. The furrows were very deep,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_23:0.0000:and the rain soon filled them with water. Here we were never-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_24:0.0000:theless tired enough to sleep ; but many a poor fellow contracted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_25:0.0250:the fever that day and night, which, within a fortnight, consigned

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_19:0.0000:was under arrest for a week for firing off a pistol. The boys were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_20:0.0000:sometimes very sure that their guns were so rusty that they
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_21:0.0000:wouldn't go off, and the cartridges couldn't be drawn with a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_22:0.0000:wonner ; and, furthermore, an attack from the rebels was hourly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_23:0.0000:expected. Yet if an unlucky private tried his piece, and it did go,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_24:0.0000:he was summoned up in the front of the Colonel's quarters, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_25:0.0000:ordered to do penance by standing there under arms tili duly re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_26:0.0000:leased. The muse records this as an instance of dilemmas in

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_17:0.0250:storming party at Port Hudson, May 27, was killed. On one
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_18:0.0000:occasion, while at Bayou Montesino, he was officer of the day ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_19:0.0000:and a company of Rhode Island cavalry, who wera out on picket,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_20:0.0000:thought they discovered the enemy approaching, and reported
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_21:0.0000:accordingly to Colonel O'Brien, who rushed to Headquarters and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_22:0.0000:made such representations that Dudley's brigade of our division

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0375_7:0.0000:said Judge Sumner presided over a court of still more limited

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0511_8:0.0000:will create for it a universal interest. This third work in order of publication
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0511_9:0.0000:by this fearless investigator, has, in large part, been written since his Trial before

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0511_30:0.0000:cate satire. In short, Rev. Green Willingwood says and does precisely that which
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0511_31:0.0500:is wont to be said and done, but which, for obvious reasons, cannot be spoken from

languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_0:0.0250:EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_3:0.0000:reading, such a statement seems absurdly un-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_4:0.0000:true to the history of elementary instruction.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_6:0.0500:confirms the claim. It is true that the earliest
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_7:0.0000:activities of our older schools were exclusively
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_8:0.0000:associated with language and literature; and that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_9:0.0000:for centuries the materials of education remained
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_10:0.0000:dominantly linguistic. Nevertheless the tradi-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_11:0.0000:tional school was not interested in literary ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_12:0.0250:pression, or anything closely approximating it.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_13:0.0000:The study of language was formal rather than
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_14:0.0250:literary ; it was devised to teach children to un-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_15:0.0000:derstand in an abstract way the formalities of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_16:0.0000:spelling, grammar, and rhetoric, rather than to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_17:0.0250:lead them into a sincere expression of their own
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_18:0.0250:lives through the medium of the art-forms of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0009_19:0.0500:speech and written language.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_0:0.0000:EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_2:0.0000:schoolmaster, only a slight modification in his
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_3:0.0000:manners. It took a quarter-century of pedagog-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_4:0.0250:ical rebellion to break the monopoly of formal-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_5:0.0000:mindedness in language instruction. Now a few
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_6:0.0000:teachers at least have a sane theory of the rela-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_7:0.0000:tion of language and literature to life in school or
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_8:0.0250:out. Even among the rank and file it is no longer
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_9:0.0250:fashionable to speak of the language studies as
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_10:0.0250:formal subjects. They are vital rather than for-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_11:0.0000:mal, because they are based on the child's own
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_12:0.0500:experiences and terminate in the expression and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_13:0.0000:solution of his own problems. Reading, penman-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_14:0.0250:ship, spelling, grammar, and rhetoric are not re-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_15:0.0000:garded as disciplines pursuing independent ends.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_16:0.0000:Their kinship is recognized through their com-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_17:0.0000:mon contribution to oral and written expression
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_18:0.0250:and to literature. Reading and literature have
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_19:0.0000:become one study, the function of which is to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_20:0.0000:appreciate life beyond immediate sense contact.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_21:0.0000:And spelling, grammar, and rhetoric have been
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_22:0.0000:reduced to the position of occasional aids to writ-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_23:0.0250:ing. Surely these changes are symptomatic of an
languageteaching00cooluoft_0010_24:0.0250:altered conception of schoolteaching.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_3:0.0250:which prevents their correction through rational
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_4:0.0250:standards of criticism. But the time has come
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_5:0.0000:when the lateral influence of the newer school
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_6:0.0000:subjects, which emphasize self-expression in terms
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_7:0.0500:of use and beauty, is great enough to overcome
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_8:0.0250:the downward pressure of the tradition of for-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_9:0.0250:malism. It begins to be apparent to us that an
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_10:0.0000:understanding of language is given to children
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_11:0.0250:for the purpose of aiding expression, just as their
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_12:0.0000:knowledge of woods, tools, plants, and soils is in-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_13:0.0000:tended as a guide to useful action in industry and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_14:0.0000:agriculture. The expressive function of language
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_15:0.0000:teaching is its dominant one. To the extent that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_16:0.0000:literature widens the horizons of human experi-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_17:0.0000:ence and gives it significant interpretation, it
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_18:0.0000:modifies the substance of the child's thought and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_19:0.0000:feeling; to the extent that it suggests an effect-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_20:0.0000:ive and congenial manner of voicing the needs
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_21:0.0500:of life, it will give command over the forms of ef-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0011_22:0.0250:fective and winsome expression. Thus language

languageteaching00cooluoft_0012_10:0.0500:must rebuild its practice. This volume, with its

languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_8:0.0250:The teaching of no other subject is so vitally
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_9:0.0500:wrapped up in the gospel of life as is the teach-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_10:0.0250:ing of the so-called language group of studies
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_11:0.0500:(reading, language lessons, writing, spelling, dic-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_12:0.0250:tation, oral and written composition, and, later,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_13:0.0250:grammar and rhetoric). For this reason, cold,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_14:0.0500:formal treatment of these studies is most dead-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0013_19:0.0500:cymbal," though every word be correctly used and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_4:0.0500:language training is giving skill in self-expres-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_7:0.0500:his own way of looking at things ; skill in express-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_8:0.0000:ing them in terms of simplicity, sincerity, and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_9:0.0000:effectiveness. To teach language is to rouse,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_10:0.0500:stimulate, and guide a twofold activity in the pu-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_16:0.0250:pose and value. The first requisite is interest in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_21:0.0500:stimulate thought and feeling ; (2) to give prac-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_22:0.0500:tice in the habit of thinking clearly and of ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_24:0.0250:suggestion, imitation (unconscious and con-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_25:0.0000:scious), repetition, habit ; there is no other path
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_26:0.0250:to the development of language power. No per-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_28:0.0500:out. It is rediscovered by each who studies
languageteaching00cooluoft_0014_29:0.0500:2
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_5:0.0000:ideal. The natural stimulus of every phase of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_6:0.0000:human activity is the ideal that takes hold of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_7:0.0000:mind and heart; and the effectiveness of that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_8:0.0250:activity in each individual depends upon the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_9:0.0000:strength of his purpose and the degree of effort
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_10:0.0000:he puts forth ; these in turn depend upon the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_11:0.0000:vividness and potency of the stimulating idea.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_12:0.0250:The word ideal means idea plus desire to attain
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_14:0.0500:The child finds his first language ideals in the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_15:0.0500:words he hears at home, on the street and play-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_16:0.0500:ground, and, later, at school. The growth of his
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_22:0.0250:beauty must always precede and accompany suc-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_23:0.0000:cessful efforts to attain truthful and beautiful
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_25:0.0250:of painting, build on this principle. Why should
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_26:0.0250:there be divorce of practice from ideals in this
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_27:0.0000:one great universal art of language ? To be sure,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_28:0.0000:there is no skill without repeated doing ; but it
languageteaching00cooluoft_0015_29:0.0500:3
languageteaching00cooluoft_0016_13:0.0500:ciples must be recognized: (i) that the subtle
languageteaching00cooluoft_0016_14:0.0500:influence of vital contact with the best expres-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0016_15:0.0250:sions of that art molds the student's efforts into

languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_1:0.0000:THE USE OF LITERATURE AS THE BASIS OF
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_10:0.0500:twofold standard: (i) The thought and feeling
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_11:0.0000:embodied must add beauty, meaning, and so joy,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_12:0.0250:to the everyday life of the child in his present
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_18:0.0500:copy. A necessary element of art is that it shall
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_19:0.0250:be an expression of the individual's own way of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_20:0.0250:seeing, feeling, and doing ; and this means neither
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_21:0.0250:imitation nor reproduction. A great poem should
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_22:0.0500:never be paraphrased. A story in verse, not a
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_23:0.0500:poem, may be rewritten in prose form ; and a real
languageteaching00cooluoft_0017_24:0.0250:5
languageteaching00cooluoft_0018_1:0.0250:poem or a bit of fine prose may be copied for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0018_2:0.0000:various purposes related to vocabulary or stand-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0018_3:0.0000:ards of form ; but literature as the natural basis
languageteaching00cooluoft_0018_4:0.0500:of language lessons serves a far greater end. It

languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_6:0.0500:laws operating, viz. : ideals, suggestion, uncon-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_10:0.0500:phrase have a peculiar charm for the young, ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_11:0.0500:erting their strongest influence during the period
languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_12:0.0250:of greatest growth in language power. In youth,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_13:0.0250:more often than in adult life, the form of ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0019_15:0.0500:of the brain and remains the form in which the

languageteaching00cooluoft_0020_13:0.0250:tions, griefs, and joys. It must portray the two
languageteaching00cooluoft_0020_20:0.0500:child ; it should boldly outline the central inter-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_17:0.0000:of the value and significance of the work. If he
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_18:0.0000:conceives it to be merely instruction in the use
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_19:0.0250:of language forms, the result will inevitably bear
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_20:0.0500:the stamp of the mechanical. If, on the other
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_21:0.0500:hand, his conscious purpose is to enlarge and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_22:0.0500:deepen the thought and feeling to be expressed,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_23:0.0250:and at the same time to develop technical accur-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_24:0.0250:acy, skill, and worthier form, the result will be
languageteaching00cooluoft_0021_29:0.0000:9

languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_4:0.0250:take shape or body until it comes to birth in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_5:0.0250:language. But it is possible to know the recorded
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_7:0.0500:bearing. Only when the feeling which accom-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_10:0.0500:felt in language teaching. The story of Helen
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_11:0.0250:Keller's life impresses the feeling of the value of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_15:0.0250:written this great truth that it makes powerful

languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_28:0.0250:mysterious contact of Spirit." Helen Keller,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0022_30:0.0500:10
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_1:0.0250:terizes her to-day, is a concrete illustration of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_2:0.0250:this message. Miss Sullivan, the rare teacher of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_3:0.0500:this rare soul, says : " Helen learned language by

languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_18:0.0500:Of himself, by his own observing, imaging, and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_19:0.0000:thinking, the child learns many things about the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_20:0.0500:world in which he lives ; he vaguely feels many
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_22:0.0000:much of what he sees. But in literature he finds
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_23:0.0000:the thought of those who have seen more, felt
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_24:0.0000:more deeply, and expressed themselves more ef-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_25:0.0000:fectively. Here he finds not only inspiration, but
languageteaching00cooluoft_0023_26:0.0500:also models of form.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_7:0.0250:the mind of the speaker or writer. The result
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_8:0.0250:for each individual is a series of pictures with
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_9:0.0000:familiar setting, suggested and colored by the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_17:0.0000:the famous psalm * The Lord is my Shepherd ' ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_18:0.0500:and from the places employed in its illustration,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_19:0.0500:which are all in the neighborhood of the house
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_20:0.0500:then occupied by my father, I am able to date it
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_21:0.0000:before the seventh year of my age. The ' pas-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_22:0.0250:tures green ' were represented by a certain sub-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_23:0.0000:urban stubble field where I had once walked
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_24:0.0000:with my nurse under an autumnal sunset. . . .
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_25:0.0500:Here, in the fleecy person of the sheep, I seemed
languageteaching00cooluoft_0024_28:0.0250:which I was incarnated as if for greater se-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_2:0.0000:ton cemetery. . . . Here I beheld myself some
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_3:0.0000:paces ahead (seeing myself, I mean, from behind)
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_4:0.0500:utterly alone in that uncanny passage ; on the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_5:0.0000:one side of me a rude, knobby shepherd's staff,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_6:0.0000:on the other a rod like a billiard cue, appeared
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_10:0.0250:I will never tell you how that the presence
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_12:0.0000:In this string of pictures I believe the gist of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_13:0.0000:the psalm to have consisted ; I believe it had no
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_14:0.0000:more to say to me ; and the result was consola-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_15:0.0250:tory. I would go to sleep dwelling with restful-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_16:0.0000:ness upon these images. ... I had already sin-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_17:0.0000:gled out one lovely verse a scarce conscious joy

languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_24:0.0000:ories of childhood experiences, the heart of a
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_25:0.0000:child to interpret them, and the creative ability
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_26:0.0000:to bring them forth. He thus lays bare many
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_27:0.0500:universal feelings of childhood as he reads the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0025_28:0.0250:emotions in his own soul.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_8:0.0500:written in my mind by these loud words, but I
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_9:0.0250:believe the words themselves were what I
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_10:0.0250:cherished. I must have been taught the love of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_11:0.0250:beautiful sounds before I was breeched." The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_14:0.0000:Life " and Wordsworth's " Daffodils " said the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_21:0.0250:literature. The so-called literature, rewritten,

languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_24:0.0250:tial qualities of great literature and of the minds
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_25:0.0250:of children. The truth is that it is only the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_27:0.0250:child heart. For real literature expresses the soul
languageteaching00cooluoft_0026_29:0.0500:14
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_2:0.0000:all great literature is suitable nourishment for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_3:0.0250:the young mind ; it is saying that all suitable
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_4:0.0500:literature for the young mind is great literature.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_5:0.0000:It is the range, not the quality, of thought and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_6:0.0000:emotion that is limited by experience.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_7:0.0000:The literature that touches the heart of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_8:0.0000:child appeals to his imagination and stirs his
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_9:0.0000:emotions by suggesting and reviving his own
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_10:0.0000:experiences ; it appeals to his love of action. It
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_11:0.0000:must touch his loves, his hates, his aspirations,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_14:0.0000:day objects of the everyday world with the wand
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_15:0.0000:of fancy, playing with their similarities and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_16:0.0000:resemblances, personifying sticks and stones,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_17:0.0500:sun, moon, and stars, and even the phenomena
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_18:0.0250:and forces of nature. If things do not "come
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_19:0.0250:alive" in the outer world, they must be made
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_20:0.0000:alive in the inner world ; must " move about and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0027_21:0.0000:do things." The richer the imagery, the more

languageteaching00cooluoft_0028_5:0.0000:no modern writer of "stories and verses for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0028_6:0.0000:the young." Hugh Miller, the man, writing of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0028_11:0.0500:in Pope's translation, I found in the house of a
languageteaching00cooluoft_0028_12:0.0500:neighbor. Next came the Iliad .... With

languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_12:0.0000:Many another old English poet gives us gems
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_13:0.0250:of real child literature. Edmund Spenser may
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_14:0.0000:be quoted as an example. We find in his verse
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_15:0.0000:music, vivid word-painting, color, rich imagery,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_16:0.0000:personification, action, and the simplicity result-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_17:0.0000:ing from living close to nature in loving intimacy.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_18:0.0250:" We wander at will amidst this endless variety
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_19:0.0000:of incident, of figures, all steeped in the colors
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_20:0.0000:of the imagination, without being reminded that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_21:0.0250:there are bounds to the world we have entered,"
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_22:0.0500:writes one who knows this poet well. True, the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_23:0.0250:" Faerie Queene " as a whole is not for the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_24:0.0250:grades; but what of such extracts from it as
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_25:0.0000:the one given below ? This particular quotation
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_26:0.0500:is given because it has been so often happily used
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_27:0.0000:in the intermediate grades, with children from
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_28:0.0250:homes of all degrees of culture and from homes
languageteaching00cooluoft_0029_30:0.0000:17
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_11:0.0500:grain, and now we gather the harvest to keep
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_12:0.0500:us from getting hungry in the winter." There
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_13:0.0250:would be no unfamiliar word, and the child
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_14:0.0500:would surely get the facts. But would we ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_15:0.0500:change the poet's beautiful word picture for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_16:0.0500:this literal statement ? Both preserve the same
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_17:0.0000:familiar characteristics of autumn, the ripened
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_18:0.0250:fruits, the vivid yellow coloring, the harvest ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_19:0.0250:but the poet embodies them in a personified au-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_20:0.0000:tumn, such as the child loves to picture; and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_21:0.0250:he feels the spirit of the season as a child feels it.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_22:0.0250:Does anyone believe that a child cannot image
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_26:0.0500:The boy, Robert Louis Stevenson, knew nothing
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_27:0.0250:of the theology of the Twenty-third Psalm, nor
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_28:0.0000:did he comprehend the exact meaning of many
languageteaching00cooluoft_0030_30:0.0250:18
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_1:0.0500:he went to sleep " dwelling with restf ulness upon
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_2:0.0500:these images." The "scarce conscious joy of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_3:0.0000:childhood " was a " companion thought of age."
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_4:0.0500:Does not many an adult who can explain the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_9:0.0500:Literature, as a basis of language training, has
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_10:0.0250:many uses besides the inspirational : it is a means
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_11:0.0250:of cultivating the ear ; of enriching the vocabu-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_12:0.0500:lary ; of developing the feeling for a choice word,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_13:0.0250:an apt phrase, and a well-constructed sentence.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_14:0.0500:To attempt to limit the selections to the fami-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_15:0.0000:liar vocabulary or the commonplace expressions
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_16:0.0000:would violate the principles of literature, of teach-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_17:0.0000:ing, and of the nature of children. Even a cer-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_18:0.0000:tain quaintness of diction has a charm. For ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_19:0.0250:ample, boys and girls of the intermediate grades
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_20:0.0000:delight in hearing selections from Lanier's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_22:0.0250:them well. Such selections interpreted by a good
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_23:0.0250:reader add much to the ear training so essential
languageteaching00cooluoft_0031_29:0.0500:19
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_6:0.0000:sarily an important factor of every phase of lan-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_7:0.0250:guage teaching, including the teaching of oral
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_8:0.0000:reading. That it may be the best literature for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_9:0.0250:the pupils at that time, it should be selected by
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_10:0.0500:one who has the wide knowledge of literature
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_12:0.0500:the sympathy with children that means loving
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_15:0.0000:and beauty, and be able by his sympathetic
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_19:0.0250:and profitable use of " Snow-Bound" illustrates
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_20:0.0250:the points that have been made. It is typical of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_21:0.0250:a set of more than a hundred such reports sent
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_22:0.0000:to the writer by as many teachers in third and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_23:0.0000:fourth grades. This one came from a school
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_24:0.0250:where most of the pupils are the children of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0032_30:0.0500:20
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_2:0.0250:general discussion with free questions ; then re-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_3:0.0250:reading, the oftener the better. Sometimes the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_4:0.0250:children listened silently and drew the pictures.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_6:0.0500:wanted to learn, and in that way we committed
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_7:0.0000:sixty lines. Here are a few of their comments :
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_8:0.0000:'I like it because we used to live on a farm.' ' I
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_9:0.0500:like it because I haven't lived on a farm, and I'd
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_15:0.0500:and food.' * The part where they were doing things
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_16:0.0500:and the mother was knitting and they were tel-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_17:0.0250:ling stories.' 'After the storm was over, where
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_18:0.0250:the boys went out and cut through the drifts to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_19:0.0250:get to the barn.' Where the animals were mad
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_20:0.0250:because their breakfast was so long in coming to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_21:0.0500:them.' One boy said, ' Seems as if I can't keep
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_22:0.0500:from saying " Snow-Bound " all the time ' '
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_23:0.0500:Like Stevenson, these children used the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_24:0.0250:reader's pictures to bring their own to light ; and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_25:0.0000:then it became a pleasure to tell of their own
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_26:0.0000:home circle, their own home experiences, and of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_27:0.0000:experiences they would like to have, and to mem-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0033_28:0.0000:orize the beautiful, vivid pictures of the poet.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_8:0.0250:literature. It should furnish not only the inspira-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_9:0.0250:tion, but a part of the material for the language les-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_10:0.0500:son. The reading and language periods may well
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_11:0.0250:be considered as two halves of one whole. The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_12:0.0000:personal thought and feeling stirred in the one
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_13:0.0000:should find opportunity for further expression in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_14:0.0000:the other. While there can be no reading of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_15:0.0000:literature without language training, there may
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_16:0.0000:well be a time known as the language period, so
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_17:0.0250:named because its specific purpose is effective use
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_18:0.0000:of language. By means of the reading lesson,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_20:0.0000:should not only grow in knowledge and apprecia-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_21:0.0000:tion of the best things written in English, but
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_22:0.0000:also in mastery of form and ability to speak and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_23:0.0000:write more effectively. And the best forms of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_24:0.0000:expression found in the reading lesson should be
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_25:0.0500:used as standards of comparison in the practice
languageteaching00cooluoft_0035_30:0.0250:23
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_2:0.0250:of the language group ; they should be used to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_5:0.0500:teach " the mechanics of written language " and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_6:0.0250:the correct spelling of words. These are never
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_7:0.0250:separated in use outside the schoolroom, and the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_13:0.0500:There will necessarily be recitation periods
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_14:0.0250:devoted to class criticisms and corrections of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_15:0.0250:dictation work and of oral and written composi-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_17:0.0250:writers. There should be drawing and construc-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0036_18:0.0000:tive lessons also, to illustrate and impress ideas

languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_1:0.0000:SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS IN THE USE
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_5:0.0250:poem to the children so as to make it most effect-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_6:0.0000:ive in moving and molding self-expression. The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_7:0.0250:well-told story will kindle stronger response than
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_8:0.0250:the story read aloud, though the latter has its
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_9:0.0250:value and should not be entirely neglected. The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_10:0.0250:poem recited makes stronger appeal to the list-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_11:0.0000:ener than the poem read to him. There is also
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_12:0.0250:value in training to reproduce what is read si-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_13:0.0250:lently. But the teacher cannot too strongly em-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_14:0.0250:phasize the thought as first stated, viz : that the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_17:0.0250:sion. To be a good reader, and to have his silent
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_18:0.0250:reading affect his own use of language, the pupil
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_19:0.0250:must be trained to hear the words he sees. To
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_20:0.0500:cultivate this habit, and the habit of " imagin-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_22:0.0500:habit of assimilating the language of literature
languageteaching00cooluoft_0037_24:0.0250:25
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_9:0.0000:does it reveal its great central meaning and its
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_10:0.0500:beauty. Give it without comment, because each
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_11:0.0000:listener is entitled to the joy of discovery. One
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_12:0.0000:little fellow voiced what hundreds have felt when
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_13:0.0500:he said: "Please don't stop to explain. I see it
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_14:0.0500:all so plain until you stop to explain, and then I
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_15:0.0500:get all mixed up." The child is entitled first to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_16:0.0000:his own personal interpretation of the meaning,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_17:0.0250:no matter how crude and faulty. It is the great,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0038_18:0.0250:vital, essential truth of the poem that we wish to

languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_3:0.0000:ing, memory, interpretative power and desire to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_4:0.0000:communicate to others what is seen, thought,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_7:0.0000:finish reciting this poem: (i) what pictures you
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_9:0.0500:you see them ; (3) what pictures certain stanzas
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_10:0.0250:(or sentences) make you see (word pictures in-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_11:0.0500:dicated by the teacher) ; (4) what parts you like
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_12:0.0000:best; (5) what the whole makes you think of."
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_13:0.0000:These questions may at first be given one at a
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_14:0.0250:time, with discussion after each repeated pre-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_15:0.0000:sentation of the whole. The last question points
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_17:0.0250:revelation and interpretation. When a number
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_18:0.0500:of fifth grade pupils said that Sidney Lanier's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_19:0.0250:"The Song of the Chattahoochee " made them
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_20:0.0000:think of Longfellow's "Excelsior," it was the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_21:0.0250:best possible evidence that they had grasped the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_26:0.0000:vital to the meaning of the poem, prepare for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0039_27:0.0250:these by story, pictures, or objects. But do not

languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_8:0.0250:alry, when a man's castle was his fortress. By
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_9:0.0250:pictures, give needed knowledge of the parts of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_10:0.0250:a castle ; but make no conscious connection be-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_13:0.0500:Why make this preparation before giving the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_15:0.0500:impression, the more abiding. Figures of speech
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_16:0.0500:are used by the author to illuminate his message
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_17:0.0250:by referring to something supposed to be familiar
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_18:0.0250:to the reader. Whenever the thought of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_19:0.0250:hearer or reader is arrested and the interest
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_20:0.0000:weakened by an allusion meaningless to him, the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_21:0.0250:literature loses a measure of its power. And the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0040_27:0.0500:sonal experiences that include the seeing of what
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_0:0.0250:SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_1:0.0250:and deepens the interest in the picture. This ele-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_2:0.0250:ment the teacher must often add from the pupil's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_3:0.0000:experience to bring him into vital touch with the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_4:0.0000:beauty and power of the description. For ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_5:0.0000:ample, stories and descriptions of his own home
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_6:0.0500:help each better to appreciate Phoebe Gary's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_10:0.0000:enjoyment of parts of this poem. Stories told by
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_11:0.0250:teacher and pupils of similar experiences in the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_12:0.0000:woods and by the streams, with accounts of what
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_13:0.0000:was seen there, not only bring nearer the boy of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_14:0.0500:the poem, but help all to see more clearly what
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_19:0.0000:questions to be discussed after the reading ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0041_21:0.0500:without interruption ; then (4) provide abundant

languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_6:0.0250:or made. He enters more fully into the spirit of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_7:0.0250:what he reads after he has " acted it out " in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_10:0.0000:expression which will best illuminate its mean-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_16:0.0000:course a narrative poem, not a descriptive poem,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_17:0.0000:best lends itself to dramatization ; e.g., we do not
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_18:0.0250:attempt to dramatize "Our Old Brown Home-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_20:0.0250:little brown house with the apple boughs reach-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_22:0.0250:their branches brushing against the window-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_25:0.0500:the " rude old sweep " with bucket attached. And
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_26:0.0500:for the child, these vitalize the poem. They help
languageteaching00cooluoft_0042_27:0.0250:him to see a very real home.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_2:0.0500:pupils. Call attention to the beautiful or the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_6:0.0000:of literature and economize time and energy by
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_7:0.0000:making it a means of practice in writing, spell-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_8:0.0000:ing, and the use of the " mechanics of written
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_9:0.0000:language." Selections copied and written from
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_10:0.0000:dictation or memory fix by study and by use the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_11:0.0000:correct forms of the words, many of which will
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_12:0.0000:be needed later in the pupil's written composi-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_13:0.0000:tion. This work also helps to fix the habit of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_14:0.0000:using correctly the various marks of punctuation,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_15:0.0500:while fixing in the mind something worthy in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_16:0.0250:both thought and form.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_17:0.0000:Have stories reproduced occasionally, orally
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_18:0.0250:and in writing. Carefully select the stories for
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_19:0.0000:this purpose. The special values are cultivation
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_20:0.0500:of attention and memory ; freedom in expres-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_21:0.0000:sion ; growth in power to see relations, to grasp
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_22:0.0000:essentials, and to tell connectedly; use of correct
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_23:0.0000:forms ; and enlargement of vocabulary. Lead
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_24:0.0500:even young children to the idea of continuity.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_25:0.0500:Constant emphasis of " What comes next ? " with
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_26:0.0000:much retelling to tell better in this respect, helps
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_27:0.0000:to establish the ideal. This accomplished, there
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_28:0.0250:may, later, be class discussion before the repro-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0043_29:0.0000:duction, resulting in the adoption of two or three

languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_5:0.0250:vocabulary. Pupils may sometimes be required to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_6:0.0500:use in their own story-telling, certain specified
languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_15:0.0500:and recited. Through the hearing, discussing,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_16:0.0250:illustrating, repetition of lines, copying, dicta-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_18:0.0250:gested, the poem is memorized by some children
languageteaching00cooluoft_0044_19:0.0000:in the class, and partly memorized by all of them.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_11:0.0000:Each must overcome his faults by his own
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_12:0.0000:efforts. He must see them himself, and himself
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_13:0.0000:feel them as faults before he will put forth this
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_14:0.0000:corrective effort. The wrong is seen by its com-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_15:0.0000:parison with the right, the false by its diverg-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_16:0.0000:ence from the true. The habit of comparing his
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_17:0.0000:own work, in specific points, with the work of an
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_18:0.0000:artist impresses the right and the true forms on
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_19:0.0000:eye and ear. Correcting his own mistakes to bring
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_20:0.0000:his own work into line with the right he has him-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_21:0.0250:self seen, fixes the impression by voice or hand.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_22:0.0250:By this comparison, the child also learns to feel
languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_23:0.0000:and unconsciously imitate the clearness, beauty,

languageteaching00cooluoft_0045_26:0.0000:story-telling long before he knows them by

languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_5:0.0000:of them daily exercises in self-expression. Both
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_6:0.0000:teachers and pupils grow in realization of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_7:0.0000:truth that "to see something clearly and to tell
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_8:0.0000:it in a plain way" is not merely the gift of a
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_9:0.0000:genius, but an art to be mastered. And the happy

languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_16:0.0000:The responses will be something like this : " I

languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_19:0.0000:saw tin soldiers with painted coats on." " I saw
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_20:0.0250:toys all over the bed." (What toys ?) " I saw ships

languageteaching00cooluoft_0048_14:0.0500:all the pictures you see ; but instead of telling
languageteaching00cooluoft_0048_15:0.0500:in your own words, repeat the lines in the poem
languageteaching00cooluoft_0048_16:0.0500:that make you see them." Different lines will be
languageteaching00cooluoft_0048_17:0.0250:repeated by different pupils. Sometimes the en-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_6:0.0000:the result of many cooperative forces working
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_8:0.0250:learned to know through what he has himself
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_9:0.0250:seen, heard, thought, and done ; all that he has
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_10:0.0000:felt in response to life's experiences and in re-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_13:0.0250:to-day, manifests itself in his own expression.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_14:0.0500:The strength and power of this impulse from
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_15:0.0500:within will depend on the clearness and range of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_16:0.0000:knowledge and the consequent depth and gen-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_17:0.0000:uineness of the feeling. The force with which
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_18:0.0000:this expression will take hold of another is con-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0061_19:0.0000:ditioned upon mastery of words : of vocabulary,

languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_4:0.0500:but an epitome of some life lesson. Every con-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_5:0.0250:scious attempt to express himself in oral or writ-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_6:0.0250:ten composition should be felt by the pupil to be
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_7:0.0250:the result of a series of cooperative lessons all

languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_21:0.0250:be one of a group of cooperative units. Careful
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_22:0.0250:observation of the schoolroom work of those who
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_23:0.0500:are, to some extent, using literature as a basis of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0062_24:0.0250:language lessons will show that most use a liter-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0064_7:0.0250:this purpose, best presented to the ear, that the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0064_8:0.0250:minds of the pupils may be given entirely to gaz-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0067_15:0.0250:a plan is built on principles as eternal as human
languageteaching00cooluoft_0067_16:0.0000:life. Among them are the laws of conservation
languageteaching00cooluoft_0067_17:0.0000:of energy and interrelation of forces, laws as

languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_4:0.0250:Whittier the pupils catch the true spirit of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_5:0.0000:season. These poets are great enough to see as
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_6:0.0500:children see. They show us Autumn personified,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_8:0.0250:harvest sheaves and "laughing out" with joy in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_9:0.0000:his rich gifts. (In comparison with this happy
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_10:0.0500:autumn mood thus caught and given back to us,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_11:0.0000:note the morbidness from the child's point of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_12:0.0000:view of a poem like Bryant's " The Death of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_13:0.0000:Flowers.") To these pictures, add Charles Dud-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_15:0.0250:gathering on a New England farm. Let the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_16:0.0250:pupils listen to lines from James Whitcomb
languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_17:0.0500:Riley's gleeful autumn songs, closing with his

languageteaching00cooluoft_0068_23:0.0500:the vivid pictures seen through the words of

languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_4:0.0250:may be much oral repetition of statements re-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_6:0.0500:rect use of the word seen with an auxiliary. The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_8:0.0500:the thought of the theme, may also emphasize
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_18:0.0000:and poems may well illuminate the themes : The
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_19:0.0000:old Greek story of " Ceres and Proserpina " ; the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_20:0.0000:"Feast of Mondamin" from "Hiawatha"; the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_21:0.0000:poems "October" and "Down to Sleep," by

languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_24:0.0500:As previously illustrated, each group of the series
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_25:0.0250:will have its specific formal exercises for definite
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_26:0.0000:practice in the oral use of certain correct forms
languageteaching00cooluoft_0069_27:0.0000:of speech, and the use in writing of certain marks

languageteaching00cooluoft_0070_15:0.0250:the famous explorations, legendary and histori-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0070_16:0.0250:cal, among them those of Columbus. He learns

languageteaching00cooluoft_0070_26:0.0000:of quotation marks. Writing from dictation a

languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_5:0.0000:This group may well include a lesson requiring
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_6:0.0000:the correct use of forms of eight or ten verbs
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_7:0.0000:used in the poem "Columbus." These lessons
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_8:0.0250:cannot fail to help the pupil to give oral and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_9:0.0000:written accounts of other explorers, explorations,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_10:0.0000:and discoveries ; they will help him to write para-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_15:0.0500:in laying the foundation of a series of language
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_16:0.0000:lessons. Let us assume that the boys and girls
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_17:0.0250:have studied several rivers : have traced their
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_18:0.0250:courses ; have noted the explorations and settle-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_19:0.0000:ments following these river paths ; have noted
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_20:0.0250:the different ways in which streams are useful
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_21:0.0000:to man. Perhaps they have associated certain
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_22:0.0000:rivers with the thoughts or the homes of poets
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_23:0.0500:and prose-writers. Note the language values of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_24:0.0000:the following lessons.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0071_26:0.0250:about springs, brooks, rivulets, and rivers. Each

languageteaching00cooluoft_0072_21:0.0250:the exact words of the writer. To write this
languageteaching00cooluoft_0072_22:0.0000:poem correctly from memory requires a certain
languageteaching00cooluoft_0072_23:0.0250:mastery in the use of quotation marks and of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0072_24:0.0000:comma. Study of the word pictures increases
languageteaching00cooluoft_0072_25:0.0000:appreciation of the figurative use of words that

languageteaching00cooluoft_0073_23:0.0000:the self-conscious, undemonstrative period of their
languageteaching00cooluoft_0073_24:0.0000:lives. These stories afford the best possible means
languageteaching00cooluoft_0073_25:0.0250:of developing self-control, courage, protection of

languageteaching00cooluoft_0074_9:0.0000:Lanier's " The Boy's King Arthur." The class
languageteaching00cooluoft_0074_10:0.0000:may learn by heart and write from memory the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0074_11:0.0250:oath of knighthood : " I will be faithful to God

languageteaching00cooluoft_0074_16:0.0000:speak the truth and deal justly with all men."
languageteaching00cooluoft_0074_17:0.0500:Study of the use of " I will " in this oath of

languageteaching00cooluoft_0081_29:0.0500:69
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_2:0.0250:as futile as the child's attempt to check the in-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_3:0.0500:coming tide with his toy spade. To the pupil it
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_4:0.0500:becomes a tiresome, mechanical task, without
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_8:0.0000:his daily speech. Errors "at home" in one's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_9:0.0500:oral language invariably make themselves "at
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_10:0.0500:home" in his written language. Whenever the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_11:0.0000:mind is occupied with the thought to be ex-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_12:0.0500:pressed, the pen is sure to record the habits of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_14:0.0250:By the study of physiological psychology, we
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_15:0.0000:discover that the human body bears testimony
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_16:0.0500:to these facts of experience. Nature has written
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_17:0.0000:large and written deep in spinal cord and brain
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_18:0.0000:the certain reaction of the out-going motor im-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_19:0.0000:pulse to complete the impression of the incoming
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_20:0.0250:sound waves, as well as to complete the ideas
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_21:0.0000:these sounds bring in to the mind. With equal
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_22:0.0250:plainness, Nature records the tendency to repeat
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_23:0.0000:a motor activity until its path is cut so deep that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_24:0.0000:the spinal cord finally attends to the act and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_25:0.0000:leaves the brain to the service of higher mental
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_26:0.0250:activities. Not until the word forms accepted
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_27:0.0250:and adopted by speakers and writers of the best
languageteaching00cooluoft_0082_28:0.0000:English are taken care of by the spinal cord, are

languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_6:0.0000:the right ; say it ; say it again and again and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_7:0.0250:again. Listen to it until it " sounds right " and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_8:0.0000:natural ; until the needle of the ear compass swings
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_9:0.0250:ever true to the correct sound and is sensitive to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_10:0.0000:the incorrect. Then say it until the motor reac-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_11:0.0000:tion is so automatic that the right form says
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_12:0.0000:itself while the mind is engaged with its thought
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_16:0.0000:born of familiarity. From the first day of school
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_17:0.0000:to the last, every pupil should be daily "exposed"
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_18:0.0250:to the literature that belongs to him at any given
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_19:0.0000:stage of his growth, because the literature right-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_20:0.0000:fully his exerts the highest and strongest influence
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_21:0.0000:in both the thought and the form-phases of his
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_22:0.0000:language development. This daily contact would
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_23:0.0000:insure the pupil's habitual use of correct and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_24:0.0250:adequate forms of expression if, in addition, he
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_25:0.0250:heard only good language at home, at school,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_26:0.0000:and at play. To come daily into one's inheritance
languageteaching00cooluoft_0083_28:0.0250:said, and to live in daily close association with
languageteaching00cooluoft_0084_27:0.0500:form are heard. And, in addition to the positively
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_0:0.0250:HABITUAL USE OF CORRECT FORMS
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_1:0.0250:great majority of American children have heard
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_2:0.0250:only a meager, commonplace, if not coarse, vo-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_3:0.0250:cabulary. In fact, it is the rare home and the rare
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_5:0.0500:virile English. Even from parents and teachers
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_9:0.0000:weak or spasmodic or no effort to overcome
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_10:0.0500:them. From the same cause it is not unusual to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_15:0.0250:Consideration of these influences and the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_16:0.0000:inevitableness of their results may help us to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_17:0.0000:understand why our children come to the school
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_18:0.0000:with so much language equipment to get, and so
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_19:0.0000:much to get rid of. It shows us why training to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_20:0.0000:skill in the use of correct forms is a matter of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_21:0.0000:overcoming bad habits by establishing the good
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_22:0.0000:in their place; and why, in the schoolroom, con-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_23:0.0250:tact with the best must be supplemented by
languageteaching00cooluoft_0085_29:0.0500:73
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_1:0.0250:use of forms ; it also requires careful planning to
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_2:0.0000:give the pupils the systematic practice needed.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_3:0.0000:Nothing but persistent oral repetition of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_4:0.0000:correct form will overcome the habit of using
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_5:0.0250:incorrect, ungrammatical, and inelegant expres-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_6:0.0000:sions in daily speech. These are matters of ear
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_7:0.0000:training and of motor habits, as well as of knowl-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_8:0.0250:edge. As long as errors persist in a person's
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_9:0.0500:speech, they will persist in what he writes when
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_10:0.0500:full of his subject. The cure for such faults, then,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_11:0.0000:whether of speech or writing, is in oral repeti-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_12:0.0000:tion. Exercises for this purpose should be con-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_13:0.0250:versational; the more of a game element in
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_17:0.0500:But this habit of correct usage should be an

languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_20:0.0000:recommended as sound in principle and service-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_21:0.0000:able in practice : (i) provide for exercises that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_22:0.0000:require correct use of a form commonly misused ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_23:0.0000:(2) call attention to the form used and the man-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_24:0.0500:ner of using ; (3) secure repetition of the correct
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_25:0.0250:form ; (4) ask pupils to tell what form has been
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_26:0.0250:used and how it was used ; (5) lead to a simple
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_27:0.0500:statement of a direction for its use; (6) require
languageteaching00cooluoft_0086_28:0.0500:further repetition to fix habit. This plan may be

languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_5:0.0250:theory that rules of grammar would do the work.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_6:0.0000:Pupils have glibly recited the rules of syntax
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_7:0.0500:from I to L, and fifty times a day have broken
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_8:0.0250:the fifty rules. And the teacher has wondered
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_9:0.0500:why ! Rules of grammar do not fashion speech ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_10:0.0000:they record its crystallization. They never es-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_11:0.0000:tablish habits of correct usage ; they may serve
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_12:0.0000:to make that usage more intelligent and self-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_13:0.0000:directive. They throw light on the path of effort,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_14:0.0000:but it is the effort, the determined effort and the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_15:0.0000:repeated effort that conquers. Knowledge of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_16:0.0250:rule would be sufficient " if to do were as easy
languageteaching00cooluoft_0087_17:0.0000:as to know what 't were good to do." When the

languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_3:0.0500:lends itself to prescriptions, a plan is outlined
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_4:0.0500:which has the following recommendations: (i)
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_5:0.0000:It is built upon the facts and principles set forth
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_6:0.0000:in this paper ; (2) its value has been proved in the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_7:0.0000:practical experience of the most successful teach-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_8:0.0000:ers of language in all countries ; (3) it has been
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_11:0.0500:feature of language teaching that, like the good
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_12:0.0000:old orthodox multiplication table, has been lost
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_13:0.0000:out of some schools. There will be more effective
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_14:0.0000:economy of time and energy when these and
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_15:0.0500:some other lost articles of form study are found
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_16:0.0000:and restored to their proper places as involving
languageteaching00cooluoft_0088_17:0.0500:necessary practice for automatic mastery of means

languageteaching00cooluoft_0090_15:0.0250:educational world. In his grammar class, she
languageteaching00cooluoft_0090_16:0.0250:easily carried the 100% banner in parsing, ana-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_6:0.0250:within the limit of the general plan. Have the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_7:0.0000:pupils frequently read aloud sentences containing
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_8:0.0250:the desired correct forms. These sentences may
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_9:0.0250:be read sometimes from books, sometimes from
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_10:0.0000:the board. Chronic cases may be asked to read
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_11:0.0000:rapidly the same five or six sentences for several
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_13:0.0000:right school conditions, it takes but a part of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_14:0.0000:a minute. Sometimes one pupil may read the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_15:0.0000:selected sentences, and another listen and repeal
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_16:0.0000:from memory. The resourceful teacher will have
languageteaching00cooluoft_0094_17:0.0000:many devices for "keeping up steam" to keep

languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_2:0.0000:larger elements of this thought unit ; and by the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_3:0.0000:time he reaches the fifth or sixth grade he is
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_4:0.0500:ready to use intelligently the terms "subject"
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_5:0.0000:and " predicate." Similarly, his study of words is
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_6:0.0000:gradually giving him greater understanding of
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_7:0.0000:their various uses, and he begins to group them
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_8:0.0000:according to their uses in the sentence. When
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_9:0.0000:he understands that for which a term stands, he
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_10:0.0000:should use the term as naturally as he names the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_11:0.0000:parts of a flower when he is familiar with those
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_12:0.0250:parts as special organs of the flower. There seems
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_13:0.0500:to be no halfway place for the home-made, make-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_14:0.0000:shift word to be used as a substitute for the ac-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_15:0.0000:cepted term. For example, when the pupil has
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_16:0.0000:grouped the words used " to name," why belittle
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_18:0.0250:serve the word " noun " for the next grade ? By
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_19:0.0500:the end of the fifth or the sixth grade, he should
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_20:0.0000:have grown to use intelligently the names of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_21:0.0250:parts of speech, as he uses any other words that
languageteaching00cooluoft_0095_22:0.0250:have grown into his vocabulary in the natural

languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_3:0.0500:helps to clear the thought. Though the founda-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_4:0.0000:tion is thus laid for the study of grammar, it is
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_5:0.0000:not at this time for the sake of grammar ; it is
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_8:0.0000:in vocabulary, and in appreciation of some of the
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_9:0.0000:underlying principles, the time arrives for sys-

languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_11:0.0000:the study of English naturally divides into two
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_12:0.0000:lines : grammar, which is followed by the study
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_13:0.0250:of logic and other related subjects ; and literature
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_14:0.0250:and composition, which are to be a lifelong study
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_15:0.0500:and delight. But the analysis of thought required
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_16:0.0250:by an understanding of grammar as an organized
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_17:0.0250:body of principles is difficult for the immature
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_18:0.0250:and untrained mind. This branch of study should
languageteaching00cooluoft_0096_19:0.0500:under no circumstances be attempted before the

languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_6:0.0000:lection, collection, preparation, and arrangement
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_8:0.0000:that involve years of study and of time. It im-
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_9:0.0250:plies a series of textbooks embodying the results
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_10:0.0000:of these years of experience. But with the best
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_11:0.0250:available series of books, much which only he
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_12:0.0250:can do remains to be done by each individual
languageteaching00cooluoft_0097_13:0.0500:teacher. The books should suggest, inspire, give

cu31924026877120_0005_3:0.0500:Daptdd ap Gwilym occupies not only a unique place in the
cu31924026877120_0005_4:0.0500:history of Welsh poetry, but is one of the most original
cu31924026877120_0005_5:0.0000:singers who appeared in Europe before the Eevival of
cu31924026877120_0005_6:0.0000:Learning. He stands well-nigh without a kinsman among
cu31924026877120_0005_7:0.0000:the poets of the Middle Ages— a lyric singer, whose "native
cu31924026877120_0005_8:0.0000:wood-notes wild" are the utterance of a singularly indi-
cu31924026877120_0005_9:0.0000:vidual and strong poetic impulse, and whose "first, fine,
cu31924026877120_0005_10:0.0000:careless rapture" has never been quite recaptured by any
cu31924026877120_0005_11:0.0000:Welsh poet who followed him. Despite the limitations
cu31924026877120_0005_12:0.0000:imposed upon him by the rigorous structure of the cywydd,
cu31924026877120_0005_13:0.0000:Dafydd's poetical gift was pre-eminently lyrical, and his
cu31924026877120_0005_14:0.0000:supremacy among the Welsh bards of his own and subse-
cu31924026877120_0005_15:0.0250:quent times lies in the consummate skill with which he
cu31924026877120_0005_16:0.0000:has subdued so difiicult a metrical form as the cywydd to
cu31924026877120_0005_17:0.0250:every mood of the lyric muse. Among the mediaeval poets
cu31924026877120_0005_18:0.0000:of Europe the famous German Minnesinger, Walther von
cu31924026877120_0005_19:0.0000:der Vogelweide, is perhaps his nearest congener as a lyric
cu31924026877120_0005_20:0.0000:singer, and in those of their poems which show the clear
cu31924026877120_0005_21:0.0000:influence of the songs of the Troubadours there are many
cu31924026877120_0005_22:0.0250:close resemblances between the Welsh poet and the German.
cu31924026877120_0005_23:0.0000:But deriving much though Dafydd ap Gwilym did, as we
cu31924026877120_0006_1:0.0000:shall see, from the conventional love-poetry of the Trouba-
cu31924026877120_0006_2:0.0000:dours, he was too ingenuous and wayward a child of Nature
cu31924026877120_0006_3:0.0000:to order his expression of the most elemental of human
cu31924026877120_0006_4:0.0000:passions according to any literary precedent or to the
cu31924026877120_0006_5:0.0250:requirements of any artificial poetical "code". Moreover,
cu31924026877120_0006_6:0.0000:it is less in his love-songs than in his nature-poems that
cu31924026877120_0006_7:0.0000:Dafydd's prime poetic gift most distinctively appears.
cu31924026877120_0006_8:0.0000:Indeed, his lyrics of Nature — among which his poems
cu31924026877120_0006_9:0.0000:on birds stand out as signal examples — are so unlike
cu31924026877120_0006_10:0.0250:anything else in the whole range of mediaeval literature
cu31924026877120_0006_11:0.0000:as to constitute, in their kind, the most original contribu-
cu31924026877120_0006_12:0.0000:tion of the native genius of Wales to the world's poetry.
cu31924026877120_0006_13:0.0000:But, however original a poet's natural gift and. manner
cu31924026877120_0006_14:0.0000:of utterance may seem to be, he is, after all, the child
cu31924026877120_0006_15:0.0000:of his age, and must of necessity owe much to the
cu31924026877120_0006_16:0.0000:literary culture which was his birth-right. Dafydd's own
cu31924026877120_0006_17:0.0000:countrymen, in particular, have been too much in the
cu31924026877120_0006_18:0.0000:habit of regarding him as an untutored genius, and
cu31924026877120_0006_19:0.0000:of scouting the suggestion that his poetry may have
cu31924026877120_0006_20:0.0000:owed anything to external influences. The truth, how-
cu31924026877120_0006_21:0.0000:ever, is that Dafydd ap Grwilym was, for his time, a
cu31924026877120_0006_22:0.0000:considerable scholar, and that, in his poetry, he drew
cu31924026877120_0006_23:0.0000:largely both upon such books as were accessible to him
cu31924026877120_0006_24:0.0000:and upon all the poetical lore and precept that came his
cu31924026877120_0006_25:0.0250:way. My object in this paper is to trace some of the more
cu31924026877120_0006_26:0.0000:obvious of his relationships with his predecessors in the
cu31924026877120_0006_27:0.0000:art of poetry, and, more particularly, with the Proven9al
cu31924026877120_0006_28:0.0000:Troubadours. Several critics have already written a good
cu31924026877120_0006_29:0.0000:deal about Dafydd's relation to the Welsh bards who
cu31924026877120_0006_30:0.0000:preceded him, and of his indebtedness to those classical
cu31924026877120_0006_31:0.0000:writers, chiefly Latin, who were popular in the Middle
cu31924026877120_0006_32:0.0000:Ages. A very full and suggestive account of Dafydd's
cu31924026877120_0006_33:0.0250:indebtedness to Latin literature appears in the 1905-06
cu31924026877120_0006_34:0.0000:volume of this Society's Transactions, from the pen of
cu31924026877120_0007_5:0.0250:Historically, Dafydd ap Grwilym ushers in what is usually
cu31924026877120_0007_6:0.0250:styled the third, and the most brilliant, period in the
cu31924026877120_0007_7:0.0000:history of early Welsh poetry. Flourishing in the four-
cu31924026877120_0007_8:0.0000:teenth century, he is the first great figure, and the most
cu31924026877120_0007_9:0.0250:inspired singer, among the Welsh bards of the Renaissance.
cu31924026877120_0007_10:0.0000:To begin with, his poems, or the collection of cywyddau that
cu31924026877120_0007_11:0.0000:go under his name — for it is now well known that all the
cu31924026877120_0007_12:0.0000:poems attributed to him in the printed editions cannot be
cu31924026877120_0007_13:0.0000:authentic works of his'— stand in striking contrast, both
cu31924026877120_0007_14:0.0000:in subject-matter and in form, to the poetry of his bardic
cu31924026877120_0007_15:0.0000:predecessors in Wales. He is, beyond any question, our
cu31924026877120_0007_16:0.0000:first great master of the cywydd. The editors of the 1789
cu31924026877120_0007_17:0.0000:edition of his poems even call him the inventor of the
cu31924026877120_0007_18:0.0000:cywydd. It may be as difficult to prove this as it
cu31924026877120_0007_19:0.0000:apparently is to account for the development of the
cu31924026877120_0007_20:0.0000:cywydd form from the earlier measures used in Welsh
cu31924026877120_0007_21:0.0000:poetry. The most obvious, as it may very well be the
cu31924026877120_0007_22:0.0000:correct, explanation of the origin of the cywydd is that the
cu31924026877120_0007_23:0.0000:last two lines of an englyn suggested to Dafydd, or some
cu31924026877120_0007_24:0.0000:one else, the possibilities of a poem composed entirely of a
cu31924026877120_0007_25:0.0000:succession of such rhyming couplets. It is scarcely credible
cu31924026877120_0007_26:0.0000:that foreign influence had much, if anything, to do with
cu31924026877120_0007_27:0.0000:it, for the main principles of the measure — cynghanedd
cu31924026877120_0007_28:0.0250:and the variation of accent in each line of the couplet —
cu31924026877120_0007_29:0.0000:appear to have been developed in Wales on entirely inde-
cu31924026877120_0007_30:0.0250:pendent lines. It should not, however, be forgotten that
cu31924026877120_0007_31:0.0250:the most popular poems in mediseval French were composed
cu31924026877120_0008_0:0.0500:Oi" DAFTbD AP GWlLYM. 5
cu31924026877120_0008_1:0.0000:in short rhyming couplets, and that, therefore, the idea of
cu31924026877120_0008_2:0.0000:combining short couplets in Welsh in the form of an ex-
cu31924026877120_0008_3:0.0000:tended poem may have been derived, to some extent, from
cu31924026877120_0008_4:0.0000:the French.^ What is of greater importance is that the
cu31924026877120_0008_5:0.0250:odes of Daf ydd ap Gwilym are our earliest finished examples
cu31924026877120_0008_6:0.0000:of the cywydd form, and that it was he who gave the
cu31924026877120_0008_7:0.0000:cywydd its vogue and sanction as the most popular bardic
cu31924026877120_0008_8:0.0000:measure containing cynghanedd from his day down to our
cu31924026877120_0008_9:0.0000:own. His own contemporaries and their successors, from
cu31924026877120_0008_10:0.0250:Gruffydd Gryg and lolo Groch dov?n to Tudur Aled and
cu31924026877120_0008_11:0.0500:William Llyn, turned out cywyddau by the hundred,
cu31924026877120_0008_12:0.0000:and "the golden age of Welsh poetry", as it has been
cu31924026877120_0008_13:0.0000:called, is emphatically the age of the cywydd. But Dafydd
cu31924026877120_0008_14:0.0000:ap Gwilym surpasses all his brother bards in his easy
cu31924026877120_0008_15:0.0000:mastery of his metrical instrument. He sings of Love and
cu31924026877120_0008_16:0.0000:of Nature with such compelling force and fervour as to
cu31924026877120_0008_18:0.0000:strains of an apparently unpremeditated art.
cu31924026877120_0008_19:0.0000:But, far more than in form, Dafydd's poetry stands out
cu31924026877120_0008_20:0.0000:in contrast to that of his Welsh predecessors in its subject-
cu31924026877120_0008_21:0.0250:matter. The second well-marked period in the history of
cu31924026877120_0008_22:0.0000:Welsh poetry extends, roughly, from the beginning of the
cu31924026877120_0008_23:0.0250:twelfth century down to the death of Lly welyn ap Gruffydd
cu31924026877120_0008_24:0.0250:in 1282, and may be called the age of the Princes. The
cu31924026877120_0008_25:0.0500:twelfth century was in Wales, as elsewhere, the beginning
cu31924026877120_0008_26:0.0000:1 Mr. W. J. Gruffydd, the Welsh Lecturer at Cardiff University
cu31924026877120_0008_28:0.0000:" The Connection between Welsh and Continental Literature in the
cu31924026877120_0008_29:0.0250:14th and 16th Centuries" (p. 34), published in The Transactions of the
cu31924026877120_0008_30:0.0000:Guild of Graduates, 1907-8. I had the pleasure of hearing his paper
cu31924026877120_0008_31:0.0000:read at Bangor a few weeks before I was to read the present paper in
cu31924026877120_0008_32:0.0000:London. As his paper, so far as it deals with D. ap Gwilym, traverses
cu31924026877120_0008_33:0.0000:so much of the same ground as my own, I ought to say that the
cu31924026877120_0008_34:0.0500:present paper had been written many months before, and for another
cu31924026877120_0009_1:0.0500:of a period of remarkable literary activity, and, with the
cu31924026877120_0009_2:0.0250:growth of the power of the Welsh princes, bards found
cu31924026877120_0009_3:0.0000:both stimulating themes to sing of and conditions emi-
cu31924026877120_0009_4:0.0000:nently favourable to the cultivation of their art. More-
cu31924026877120_0009_5:0.0250:over, some of the princes — Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd and
cu31924026877120_0009_6:0.0000:Owain Cyfeiliog, for example — were among the most
cu31924026877120_0009_7:0.0000:famous bards of this period, and remind us of those
cu31924026877120_0009_8:0.0250:Courts of Southern France where the Troubadour's art
cu31924026877120_0009_9:0.0250:became the study and the pastime even of tings.
cu31924026877120_0009_10:0.0000:And, like Provence, Wales became, during the period
cu31924026877120_0009_11:0.0000:of the Princes, a veritable "nest of singing birds". A
cu31924026877120_0009_12:0.0250:mere list of the bards who are recorded to have sung
cu31924026877120_0009_13:0.0000:from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries fills
cu31924026877120_0009_14:0.0250:nearly four pages of Stephens's Literature of the Kymry.
cu31924026877120_0009_15:0.0000:But, even apart from the difficulties of its language,
cu31924026877120_0009_16:0.0000:the poetry of this period, as a whole, presents singularly
cu31924026877120_0009_17:0.0250:few features of interest for us now. The bulk of it
cu31924026877120_0009_18:0.0250:consists of eulogies and elegies of nobles and high-bom
cu31924026877120_0009_19:0.0000:dames of the day. Occasionally a fresh note is struck in
cu31924026877120_0009_20:0.0000:some spirited lyric of Love, such as Hywel ab Owain's
cu31924026877120_0009_21:0.0000:celebrated "Can y Dewis", or a brief lay of Nature, such
cu31924026877120_0009_22:0.0000:as Grwalchmai's "Delight". But most of the bards found
cu31924026877120_0009_23:0.0250:that their duty and profit alike lay in chanting the praises
cu31924026877120_0009_24:0.0000:of their princes and their patrons. It is curious to note
cu31924026877120_0009_25:0.0000:how, in an age of Romance, purely romantic subjects
cu31924026877120_0009_26:0.0000:appear to have had no charm whatever for the Welsh
cu31924026877120_0009_27:0.0000:bards. It is not to her poets that Wales owes her one
cu31924026877120_0009_28:0.0000:supreme contribution to the greatest of the mediaeval
cu31924026877120_0009_29:0.0000:romantic cycles, but to her prose writers. We have,
cu31924026877120_0009_30:0.0000:indeed, occasional allusions to the chief characters of
cu31924026877120_0009_31:0.0000:Arthurian fable in bardic compositions, but to most of the
cu31924026877120_0009_32:0.0000:bards, as to Dafydd ap Gwilym himself, Arthur and Guine-
cu31924026877120_0009_33:0.0250:vere, Peredur and Gwalchmai, Melwas and Medrawt are
cu31924026877120_0009_34:0.0500:but names dimly syllabled on "the shores of old romance".
cu31924026877120_0010_0:0.0500:OF DAFTDD AP GWILYM. 7
cu31924026877120_0010_1:0.0000:Although Dafydd, like the rest, is comparatively in-
cu31924026877120_0010_2:0.0000:different to romantic fable, the themes of his poetry
cu31924026877120_0010_3:0.0000:introduce us to a world all but unknown to his pre-
cu31924026877120_0010_4:0.0000:decessors. In him we find a poet alive, as no other Welsh
cu31924026877120_0010_5:0.0000:bard who preceded him was, to the romance of Love and of
cu31924026877120_0010_6:0.0000:Nature, and one whose relations with Morfudd constitute
cu31924026877120_0010_7:0.0000:themselves a romantic episode not unworthy of a place
cu31924026877120_0010_8:0.0000:side by side with the attachments celebrated in verse by
cu31924026877120_0010_9:0.0000:the greatest of the Proven9al Troubadours. And it is by
cu31924026877120_0010_10:0.0000:reason of this, more than all, that Dafydd is entitled to be
cu31924026877120_0010_11:0.0000:called an innovator, and the harbinger of a new epoch in
cu31924026877120_0010_12:0.0000:the poetry of his country. Many of the new elements he
cu31924026877120_0010_13:0.0000:brought into Welsh poetry were, as I have said, due to his
cu31924026877120_0010_14:0.0000:native genius alone. His "eye to see" and his "daring
cu31924026877120_0010_15:0.0000:to follow" Nature were Grod's gifts. No foreign poet
cu31924026877120_0010_16:0.0000:could have taught him this, or those felicities of imagery
cu31924026877120_0010_17:0.0000:and phrase which are the finest gems of Welsh poetic
cu31924026877120_0010_18:0.0000:diction. But other, though intrinsically less important,
cu31924026877120_0010_19:0.0000:features in his poetry are directly traceable both to his
cu31924026877120_0010_20:0.0000:Latin culture and to his familiarity with the stock themes
cu31924026877120_0010_21:0.0000:of the early lyric poetry of France, especially that of the
cu31924026877120_0010_22:0.0000:Troubadours. Thus it is that in Dafydd's odes we detect
cu31924026877120_0010_23:0.0000:the first considerable foreign influence upon the poetry of
cu31924026877120_0010_24:0.0000:Wales. They bring Wales, for the first time, so far as
cu31924026877120_0010_25:0.0250:poetry is concerned, into touch with the main currents of
cu31924026877120_0010_26:0.0000:European literature.
cu31924026877120_0010_27:0.0250:The modern lyric poetry of Europe is the creation of
cu31924026877120_0010_28:0.0250:the "early Renaissance" of the twelfth century, and the
cu31924026877120_0010_29:0.0000:cradle of that lyric poetry was Provence. As Hallam long
cu31924026877120_0010_30:0.0000:ago pointed out, "the songs of Provence became the source
cu31924026877120_0010_31:0.0000:from which poetry for many centuries derived a great
cu31924026877120_0010_32:0.0000:portion of its habitual language". But there were other
cu31924026877120_0010_33:0.0000:forces at work besides the influence of the Troubadours of
cu31924026877120_0010_34:0.0000:Provence which made for the growth of lyric, or lighter.
cu31924026877120_0011_1:0.0250:forms of poetry — and one or two of .these have to he
cu31924026877120_0011_2:0.0000:briefly noted in any account of Dafydd's literary relation-
cu31924026877120_0011_3:0.0000:ships. The first is the Latin literature, ancient and
cu31924026877120_0011_4:0.0250:medieval, which the bard found to his hand. There can
cu31924026877120_0011_5:0.0250:be no sort of doubt that Dafydd ap Gwilym knew Latin.
cu31924026877120_0011_6:0.0000:Apart from the evidence furnished by his poems, it is
cu31924026877120_0011_7:0.0000:obvious that a man brought up, as he was, in a courtly
cu31924026877120_0011_8:0.0000:environment, would not lack knowledge of the language
cu31924026877120_0011_9:0.0000:which was the chief instrument of culture in his time.
cu31924026877120_0011_10:0.0000:And there were certain Latin books which no educated
cu31924026877120_0011_11:0.0000:man of the time could be ignorant of. Chief among them
cu31924026877120_0011_12:0.0000:were the works of Ovid. Virgil and Horace, also, were
cu31924026877120_0011_13:0.0250:largely read, but, for the love-poets and the aspiring lyrists
cu31924026877120_0011_14:0.0000:of the central Middle Age, Ovid was the supreme source of
cu31924026877120_0011_15:0.0500:inspiration and suggestion. As I have already said. Dr.
cu31924026877120_0011_16:0.0000:Hartwell Jones has so fully illustrated Dafydd's obligations
cu31924026877120_0011_17:0.0000:to Latin writers as to make it unnecessary for me here to
cu31924026877120_0011_18:0.0000:expatiate upon that side of his literary relationships. I
cu31924026877120_0011_19:0.0000:need only say that Dafydd frequently refers to "Llyfr
cu31924026877120_0011_20:0.0250:Ofydd" — Ovid's book — and that by it he means, more
cu31924026877120_0011_21:0.0250:than all, Ovid's "Art of Love".' But why the first editors
cu31924026877120_0011_22:0.0000:of Dafydd's works should have called him "the Ovid of
cu31924026877120_0011_23:0.0250:Wales", it is dif&cult to discover. No two poets could
cu31924026877120_0011_24:0.0000:well be more different in their exposition of the art of
cu31924026877120_0011_25:0.0000:love. The Welsh bard is no morbid analyst of various
cu31924026877120_0011_26:0.0000:phases of the passion, but is one whose gallantries seem
cu31924026877120_0011_27:0.0000:to take their place naturally in the free life of a man who,
cu31924026877120_0011_28:0.0000:largely in protest against the cloistral hypocrisies of his
cu31924026877120_0011_29:0.0250:time, elected to fleet his days carelessly as a child of
cu31924026877120_0011_31:0.0500:that by Uyfr Ofydd, Dafydd "understood a particular book, and that
cu31924026877120_0011_32:0.0000:book was Chrestien do Troyes's French translation called the
cu31924026877120_0012_0:0.0500:OP DAPTDD AP GWILTM. 9
cu31924026877120_0012_5:0.0250:which found exquisite expression in song. At the same
cu31924026877120_0012_6:0.0000:time, there is no mistaking the actual, downright direct-
cu31924026877120_0012_7:0.0000:ness of Dafydd's courting of his various mistresses; his
cu31924026877120_0012_8:0.0000:odes breathe, all too palpably, the ardour of keen and
cu31924026877120_0012_9:0.0000:resolute pursuit. They who would idealise Morfudd, and
cu31924026877120_0012_10:0.0000:make of her a phantom representative of her sex, or a
cu31924026877120_0012_11:0.0000:Beatrice of the Welsh highways, or a symbolical figure
cu31924026877120_0012_12:0.0000:typifying the bard's country groaning under a foreign
cu31924026877120_0012_13:0.0250:yoke, have, in my opinion, quite missed the secret of
cu31924026877120_0012_14:0.0000:Dafydd's love-poetry. His love-songs, to any unsophisti-
cu31924026877120_0012_15:0.0000:cated reader, bear every mark of being the records of
cu31924026877120_0012_16:0.0000:very real, and often enough very lively, episodes in the
cu31924026877120_0012_17:0.0000:career of an exceedingly impressionable and reckless
cu31924026877120_0012_18:0.0000:gallant. Never were more- overt and sincere poetical
cu31924026877120_0012_19:0.0000:ofBerings tendered at the shrine of Venus. These candid,
cu31924026877120_0012_20:0.0000:fervid, and forthright utterances of passion are very
cu31924026877120_0012_21:0.0500:difEerent indeed from the highly artificial and exotic love-
cu31924026877120_0012_22:0.0250:poems of Ovid.
cu31924026877120_0012_23:0.0250:It is obvious, however, that Dafydd ap Gwilym was
cu31924026877120_0012_24:0.0000:acquainted with Latin literature written at a very much
cu31924026877120_0012_25:0.0000:later time than Ovid's, and it is difficult to believe that
cu31924026877120_0012_26:0.0000:he was ignorant of those Latin poems which were the
cu31924026877120_0012_27:0.0000:direct product of that early Eenaissance of which he
cu31924026877120_0012_28:0.0000:was himself the child. No history of raediseval lyric
cu31924026877120_0012_29:0.0000:poetry can leave out of account the Latin songs of the
cu31924026877120_0012_30:0.0000:Wandering Students of the twelfth and the thirteenth cen-
cu31924026877120_0012_31:0.0000:turies — songs which, from the very circumstances and habits
cu31924026877120_0012_32:0.0250:of these students, found their way into every civilised
cu31924026877120_0012_33:0.0250:European land. These songs, says the most distinguished
cu31924026877120_0013_2:0.0250:Addington Symonds — on the one hand, express that
cu31924026877120_0013_3:0.0250:delight in life and physical enjoyment which was a main
cu31924026877120_0013_4:0.0000:characteristic of the Renaissance ; on the other, they
cu31924026877120_0013_5:0.0000:proclaim the corruption of Papal Eome, which was the
cu31924026877120_0013_6:0.0000:motive-force of the Reformation.' This statement might
cu31924026877120_0013_7:0.0500:stand as a definition of the two main themes of Dafydd ap
cu31924026877120_0013_8:0.0000:Gwilym's poetry.
cu31924026877120_0013_9:0.0250:The two chief collections of these Latin songs of the
cu31924026877120_0013_10:0.0250:Wandering Students are a volume published at Stuttgart
cu31924026877120_0013_11:0.0000:in 1847, under the title of Carmina Burana, and — what is
cu31924026877120_0013_12:0.0000:better known in England — a volume, edited by Thomas
cu31924026877120_0013_13:0.0000:Wright in 1841, of the Latin Poems commonly attributed to
cu31924026877120_0013_14:0.0000:Walter Mapes (or Walter Map) . Of the two, the Carmina
cu31924026877120_0013_15:0.0000:Burana, as Symonds points out, "are richer in poems
cu31924026877120_0013_16:0.0000:which form a prelude to the Renaissance". I can only
cu31924026877120_0013_17:0.0000:touch very briefly here upon points in these Latin songs
cu31924026877120_0013_18:0.0000:which bear resemblance to characteristic features of Dafydd
cu31924026877120_0013_19:0.0250:ap Gwilym's poetry. First of all, Nature is sung of in
cu31924026877120_0013_20:0.0250:terms of surprising freshness in these Latin lyrics. "As
cu31924026877120_0013_21:0.0000:a background to their love-songs", writes Symonds, "we
cu31924026877120_0013_22:0.0250:always find the woods and fields of May, abundant flowers
cu31924026877120_0013_23:0.0250:and gushing rivulets, lime trees and pines and olive trees,
cu31924026877120_0013_24:0.0250:through which soft winds are blowing" (p. 35). Again,
cu31924026877120_0013_25:0.0500:" the quality of love expressed is far from being either
cu31924026877120_0013_26:0.0000:platonic or chivalrous. It is love of the sensuous, im-
cu31924026877120_0013_27:0.0000:pulsive, appetitive kind, to which we give the name of
cu31924026877120_0013_28:0.0000:Pagan .... Meanwhile, nothing indicates the character
cu31924026877120_0013_29:0.0000:or moral quality of either man or woman. The student
cu31924026877120_0013_30:0.0000:and the girl are always vis-d-vis, fixed characters in this
cu31924026877120_0013_31:0.0000:lyrical love-drama. He calls her Phyllis, Flora, Lydia,
cu31924026877120_0013_32:0.0000:Glycerion, Csecilia." Here, at any rate, is some plausible
cu31924026877120_0014_0:0.0500:OP DAFTDD AP GWILTM. 11
cu31924026877120_0014_4:0.0500:women are described" — "one girl has long tawny tresses,
cu31924026877120_0014_5:0.0250:another, masses of dark hair". Witness Dafydd describ-
cu31924026877120_0014_15:0.0250:translations which bear a remarkable similarity to Dafydd
cu31924026877120_0014_19:0.0000:songs of the Proven9al Troubadours in being far less arti-
cu31924026877120_0014_20:0.0000:ficial, and more true to the facts of what we might call
cu31924026877120_0014_21:0.0000:commonplace or vulgar amours. There is yet another
cu31924026877120_0014_22:0.0000:class of mediaeval lyrics which, derived largely from the
cu31924026877120_0014_23:0.0000:poetry of the Troubadours and inheriting something from
cu31924026877120_0014_24:0.0000:the frank songs of the Wandering Students, show close
cu31924026877120_0014_25:0.0000:affinities with the poetry of Dafydd ap Gwilym. They are
cu31924026877120_0014_26:0.0250:the songs of the German Minnesingers. The Minnesingers
cu31924026877120_0014_27:0.0000:were direct inheritors of the lyrical poetry of Provence, and
cu31924026877120_0014_28:0.0000:among them there arose one who, as I have already hinted,
cu31924026877120_0014_29:0.0000:alone challenges Dafydd ap Gwilym's supremacy among
cu31924026877120_0014_30:0.0000:the mediaeval lyrists — Walther von der Vogelweide. It
cu31924026877120_0014_31:0.0000:can hardly be possible that Dafydd knew anything at all of
cu31924026877120_0015_1:0.0250:the works of his G-erman predecessor. They both drew,
cu31924026877120_0015_2:0.0000:unconsciously, from the same Provenfal sources. But the
cu31924026877120_0015_3:0.0000:resemblance between them, in a few poems, is very re-
cu31924026877120_0015_4:0.0000:markable, and serves to illustrate how close were the ties
cu31924026877120_0015_5:0.0000:that united the commonwealth of poetry in those stirring
cu31924026877120_0015_6:0.0250:and experimenting times. Allow me to quote one or two
cu31924026877120_0015_7:0.0000:translated extracts from Walther's poems which will at
cu31924026877120_0015_8:0.0500:once recall familiar passages in Dafydd ap Gwilym's
cu31924026877120_0015_27:0.0250:Again, "Winter has done us all manner of harm ;
cu31924026877120_0015_28:0.0000:heather and forest have both lost their colour, but many a

cu31924026877120_0015_30:0.0000:sleep away all the hours of Winter ! for, watching and
cu31924026877120_0015_31:0.0500:waiting, I grow angry that its power should spread far
cu31924026877120_0015_32:0.0250:and wide. God knows it must soon give place to May, and
cu31924026877120_0015_33:0.0500:1 In spite of the fact that the speaker in this poem is a woman, the
cu31924026877120_0015_34:0.0250:note struck in it is curiously similar to that of many a song of
cu31924026877120_0015_35:0.0000:Dafydd's. The translation here quoted is from an article by Mr.

cu31924026877120_0016_18:0.0000:Winter is killing the boughs, aud robbing the trees of their leaves ;

cu31924026877120_0016_27:0.0250:thereby is a question which depends on the "taste and
cu31924026877120_0016_31:0.0500:1 Had I space, I could quote many more parallels between the
cu31924026877120_0016_32:0.0000:poems of Walther and those of Dafydd. The curious student of such
cu31924026877120_0016_33:0.0000:things will find excellent translations of Walther's poems in a volume
cu31924026877120_0016_34:0.0000:of Selected Poems of W. v. d. Vogehmide, by W. Alison Phillips (Smith,
cu31924026877120_0016_35:0.0000:Elder and Co.) ; and in The Minnesingers (vol. i), by J. Bithell (Long-
cu31924026877120_0016_36:0.0000:mans, 1909). The latter work is of great interest in its bearing upon
cu31924026877120_0016_37:0.0250:the development of mediaeval lyric poetry.
cu31924026877120_0017_1:0.0250:Grwilym, we read in The Welsh PeopW "may be regarded
cu31924026877120_0017_2:0.0000:as a Welsh troubadour, whose lyric muse was devoted to
cu31924026877120_0017_3:0.0500:singing what the French called the amour cowrtois". "But
cu31924026877120_0017_4:0.0250:what", your patriotic Welsh critic may ask, "could this
cu31924026877120_0017_5:0.0500:' wild Welshman', who wandered about the Principality in
cu31924026877120_0017_6:0.0500:search of indiscriminate amours, know of Provence, or of
cu31924026877120_0017_7:0.0250:the courtly singers who paid their tribute of high-flown
cu31924026877120_0017_8:0.0000:verse to the grandes dames of the Midi ? Dafydd lived in
cu31924026877120_0017_9:0.0000:regions too remote, and was withal too spontaneous and
cu31924026877120_0017_11:0.0500:effusions of the Proven9als.''"
cu31924026877120_0017_13:0.0000:was so far removed from Continental culture, nor Dafydd
cu31924026877120_0017_14:0.0000:himself so destitute of linguistic knowledge or of literary
cu31924026877120_0017_15:0.0000:curiosity as to make it impossible for the poetry of the
cu31924026877120_0017_16:0.0000:Troubadours to have influenced him. Welshmen, long
cu31924026877120_0017_17:0.0500:before Dafydd's time, had taken part in the Crusades.
cu31924026877120_0017_18:0.0000:In his own day they swelled the ranks of Edward Ill's
cu31924026877120_0017_19:0.0250:armies in France. Throughout the Middle Ages there
cu31924026877120_0017_20:0.0250:was an unbroken intercourse between Wales and Rome.
cu31924026877120_0017_21:0.0000:Knights-errant and travelling scholars, mendicant friars
cu31924026877120_0017_22:0.0000:and vagrant minstrels, kept up a constant social and
cu31924026877120_0017_23:0.0000:intellectual commerce between Wales and the Continent.
cu31924026877120_0017_24:0.0000:Moreover, there is ample evidence that during the twelfth
cu31924026877120_0017_25:0.0000:and thirteenth centuries several famous Troubadoui's were
cu31924026877120_0017_26:0.0250:brought into close association with the English Court, and
cu31924026877120_0017_27:0.0000:that some of them even visited Britain. The marriage of
cu31924026877120_0017_28:0.0000:Eleanor of Aquitaine with Henry II, in 1152, brought a
cu31924026877120_0017_29:0.0250:large part of southern France under the dominion of the
cu31924026877120_0017_30:0.0250:English crown, while in the next century, the marriage of
cu31924026877120_0017_31:0.0000:another Eleanor, the daughter of a count of Provence,
cu31924026877120_0017_32:0.0250:with Henry III, actually drew a crowd of Provencals to the

cu31924026877120_0018_2:0.0000:Bernart of Ventadorn — whose songs, as we shall see, bear
cu31924026877120_0018_3:0.0000:many points of resemblance to those of Dafydd ap Grwilym
cu31924026877120_0018_4:0.0500:— was a protege of Eleanor of Aquitaine's, and almost cer-
cu31924026877120_0018_5:0.0250:tainly visited England in her train. Another well-known
cu31924026877120_0018_6:0.0000:Troubadour, Bertram of Born, was closely connected with
cu31924026877120_0018_7:0.0000:Henry II's court, while Peire Vidal and Arnaut Daniel —
cu31924026877120_0018_8:0.0000:both celebrated names in the history of Provencal poetry —
cu31924026877120_0018_11:0.0500:For two centuries the Troubadours were the master-
cu31924026877120_0018_12:0.0000:singers of Europe. The poet-princes and the other high-
cu31924026877120_0018_13:0.0000:born bards of Wales must have been well aware of their
cu31924026877120_0018_14:0.0250:repute and of the themes upon which they sang. The
cu31924026877120_0018_15:0.0000:great host of German Minnesingers drew their inspiration,
cu31924026877120_0018_16:0.0250:and took their models, from the courtly poetry of Provence.
cu31924026877120_0018_17:0.0000:Through various channels, and most of all through
cu31924026877120_0018_18:0.0250:wandering minstrels of every grade and kind, the influence
cu31924026877120_0018_19:0.0000:of Proven9al poetry gradually pervaded all Western
cu31924026877120_0018_20:0.0250:Europe, until, as Hallam says, "the songs of Provence
cu31924026877120_0018_21:0.0000:became the source from which poetry for many centuries
cu31924026877120_0018_22:0.0000:derived a great portion of its habitual language". Thus
cu31924026877120_0018_23:0.0250:Dante and Petrarch, Chaucer and Erangois Villon,
cu31924026877120_0018_24:0.0250:Walther von der Vogelweide and Dafydd ap Gwilym,
cu31924026877120_0018_25:0.0000:were, in their several ways and countries, direct inheri-
cu31924026877120_0018_26:0.0000:tors of the art of the Troubadours.'
cu31924026877120_0018_28:0.0500:acquaintance with the language and the actual poems
cu31924026877120_0018_33:0.0250:leavened with Troubadour poetry."— Smith's The Troubadours at Home,
cu31924026877120_0019_1:0.0250:between many of his odes and Proven9al songs are too
cu31924026877120_0019_2:0.0250:remarkable to let us believe that the Troubadours, no less
cu31924026877120_0019_3:0.0000:than the particular kinds of poetry which they cultivated,
cu31924026877120_0019_4:0.0000:were not well known to him by report. He knew enough
cu31924026877120_0019_5:0.0500:Latin and, probably, enough French to acquire a distant
cu31924026877120_0019_6:0.0250:acquaintance, at least, with the most potent international
cu31924026877120_0019_7:0.0000:factor in the development of the poetic art of his time.'
cu31924026877120_0019_8:0.0000:Thus, while it would be rash to claim Dafydd as a direct,
cu31924026877120_0019_9:0.0000:or conscious, imitator of the Troubadours, no critical treat-
cu31924026877120_0019_10:0.0000:ment of his poetry can well leave out of account those
cu31924026877120_0019_11:0.0000:features in it which, explain them as we may, reflect the
cu31924026877120_0019_12:0.0250:very impress of "Provencal song" and of the "sunburnt
cu31924026877120_0019_13:0.0000:mirth" of the South.
cu31924026877120_0019_17:0.0250:1 After the Norman Conquest there was established a close con-
cu31924026877120_0019_18:0.0000:nection between the Norman Lords and South Wales. "Kobert, earl
cu31924026877120_0019_19:0.0000:of Gloucester, acquired, early in the twelfth century, the lordship of
cu31924026877120_0019_20:0.0000:Glamorgan by marriage with Mabel, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon,
cu31924026877120_0019_21:0.0000:conqueror of Glamorgan. Robert, like his father, was a liberal and a
cu31924026877120_0019_22:0.0250:diplomatic patron of letters. It was to him that William of Malmes-
cu31924026877120_0019_25:0.0500:St. Michel, a chronicler of renown, and a lover and student of Breton
cu31924026877120_0019_27:0.0500:Geoffrey of Monmouth compiled his romantic History of the Kings of
cu31924026877120_0019_29:0.0500:on "The Arthurian Legend" in The Cambridge History of English
cu31924026877120_0019_35:0.0500:Welsh bards, and that these bards, out of the very necessity of their

cu31924026877120_0020_6:0.0000:Proven9al chansons in their subject and matter, that one
cu31924026877120_0020_7:0.0000:might almost believe they were direct imitations. These
cu31924026877120_0020_8:0.0000:are the somewhat wearisome semi-metaphysical disquisi-
cu31924026877120_0020_9:0.0000:tions on the nature and lineage of love, the golden
cu31924026877120_0020_10:0.0000:hair of Morfydd, 'Yr Hiraeth' (The Longing), etc.
cu31924026877120_0020_11:0.0250:These are the staple of Provencal poetry ; but in Ap
cu31924026877120_0020_12:0.0250:Gwilym they are only a very small portion." "In
cu31924026877120_0020_13:0.0000:Dante and Petrarch", Cowell continues, "we have the
cu31924026877120_0020_14:0.0000:very apotheosis of the Proven9al idea. The poetry of
cu31924026877120_0020_15:0.0000:Provence, at its best, was feeble and artificial ; it
cu31924026877120_0020_16:0.0000:was a delicate hot-house plant nursed by court pat-
cu31924026877120_0020_17:0.0000:ronage and shielded from all the rough winds of real
cu31924026877120_0020_18:0.0000:life, and striking its roots into a soil of fancy and senti-
cu31924026877120_0020_19:0.0000:ment, so that its shoots always betray the original
cu31924026877120_0020_22:0.0000:But in Italy the transplanted shoot found a more fertile
cu31924026877120_0020_23:0.0000:soil, and struck its roots down deep into the very heart of
cu31924026877120_0020_24:0.0000:human nature and reality; and though Dante's 'Beatrice'
cu31924026877120_0020_25:0.0000:and Petrarch's 'Laura' were originally the reflections of
cu31924026877120_0020_26:0.0000:Proven9al poetry, the genius of Dante and Petrarch have
cu31924026877120_0020_27:0.0000:created them anew and made them symbols of beauty for
cu31924026877120_0020_28:0.0000:all time. And so Ab Gwilym seems to me to have similarly
cu31924026877120_0020_29:0.0000:borrowed the Provengal idea, and then reproduced it as a
cu31924026877120_0020_30:0.0000:new creation by his own genius. We can thus trace in
cu31924026877120_0020_31:0.0500:him a new line of ProvenQal influence, derived, I suppose,
cu31924026877120_0020_32:0.0250:through France or Italy."
cu31924026877120_0021_1:0.0250:three great offices of the troubadour.'" In two of these
cu31924026877120_0021_2:0.0000:offices, at least, Dafydd ap Gwrlym was pre-eminent, and,
cu31924026877120_0021_3:0.0000:if we accept as authentic certain pious poems alleged to
cu31924026877120_0021_4:0.0000:have been composed during his declining years, he made a
cu31924026877120_0021_5:0.0000:belated attempt to qualify himself in the third. His odes
cu31924026877120_0021_6:0.0000:in praise of his patron, Ivor the Generous, will bear com-
cu31924026877120_0021_7:0.0000:parison with the best Welsh examples of bardic "lord-
cu31924026877120_0021_8:0.0000:service", and those who are familiar with the history of
cu31924026877120_0021_9:0.0000:Welsh poetry up to his time will know that Dafydd ha:d
cu31924026877120_0021_10:0.0000:no need to turn to Provence for instruction in the art of
cu31924026877120_0021_11:0.0000:courtly panegyric. It is in the poems dedicated to the
cu31924026877120_0021_12:0.0000:service of ladies that he appears most of all to borrow the
cu31924026877120_0021_13:0.0000:gay singing-robes of a Provencal troubadour. The entire
cu31924026877120_0021_14:0.0000:series of odes addressed to Morfudd are based upon a
cu31924026877120_0021_15:0.0000:relationship, which finds its nearest analogue in the amour
cu31924026877120_0021_16:0.0000:courtois which evoked from the Troubadours their service
cu31924026877120_0021_17:0.0000:of song. But Dafydd's passion for Morfudd, if she really
cu31924026877120_0021_18:0.0000:existed, had little of the chivalric courtliness, or of the
cu31924026877120_0021_19:0.0250:idealism which usually characterised the homage paid to
cu31924026877120_0021_20:0.0000:the great dames of the courts of Provence by their mins-
cu31924026877120_0021_21:0.0000:trel lovers. The Welsh bard's fashion of making love to
cu31924026877120_0021_22:0.0250:Morfudd, as to his other mistresses, is marked above every-
cu31924026877120_0021_23:0.0500:thing by a frank admiration of her person and by open
cu31924026877120_0021_24:0.0000:1 The Troubadours at Hoine, by Justin H. Smith, vol. i, p. 76. This

cu31924026877120_0021_26:0.0250:and their poetry available in English, and I have made copious use of
cu31924026877120_0021_27:0.0000:it in this paper. Another English work which gives much biograph-

cu31924026877120_0022_7:0.0000:that reYninds us of the Troubadours. His satirical tirades

cu31924026877120_0022_12:0.0000:badours, four, in particular, might almost have served as
cu31924026877120_0022_13:0.0000:models for a large proportion of the odes of D&,fydd ap
cu31924026877120_0022_14:0.0000:Gwilym. They are the canson, the sirventes, the t'enso, and
cu31924026877120_0022_15:0.0000:the alba.^ The canson, or chanson, was the name given to
cu31924026877120_0022_16:0.0000:the more elaborate form of love-song in which the poet
cu31924026877120_0022_17:0.0000:usually either hymned his lady's praises, or complained of
cu31924026877120_0022_18:0.0000:her obduracy, or of other obstacles which left him a prey

cu31924026877120_0022_21:0.0000:Smith, Troubadours at Home, vol.ii, pp. 449-451. In the elaboration
cu31924026877120_0022_22:0.0250:of verse-forms the Welsh bards, thgir " twenty-four measures " not-
cu31924026877120_0022_23:0.0000:withstanding, were altogether outstripped by the Troubadours.
cu31924026877120_0022_24:0.0000:"The 'Law of Love'" — the treatise on poetical writing compiled in
cu31924026877120_0022_25:0.0000:the thirteenth century by the College of The Gay Science at Toulouse

cu31924026877120_0022_27:0.0250:of its own, and seventy-two kinds of stanzas, all of them labelled in
cu31924026877120_0022_28:0.0000:a similar way." — Smith, Troubadours at Home, ii, p. 286.
cu31924026877120_0022_29:0.0500:2 These four, it should be noted, are not the only Provenijal types
cu31924026877120_0022_30:0.0000:with which one can find parallels among Dafydd's poems. Several of
cu31924026877120_0022_31:0.0000:eywyddau recall, for example, the pastorela, or pastourelle, in which a
cu31924026877120_0022_32:0.0000:gallant of high degree makes love to a maiden of inferior rank, and
cu31924026877120_0022_33:0.0000:where the maid's fear of her father and mother is a stock convention.
cu31924026877120_0022_34:0.0000:Again, there is the chanson de femme mal marUe, in which the poet
cu31924026877120_0022_35:0.0000:declares his love for a woman married to an old man. Akin to this
cu31924026877120_0022_36:0.0000:type are the lampoons on husbands, where the husbands are always
cu31924026877120_0022_37:0.0000:pourtrayed as grotesque and ill-favoured. Compare with these
cu31924026877120_0022_38:0.0250:Dafydd's eywyddau tuckan against "Eiddig" and the "Bwa Bach".
cu31924026877120_0023_2:0.0250:a great lord's prowess and personal virtue ; but the title
cu31924026877120_0023_3:0.0500:also covered elegies (planh), and even satires. The tenso
cu31924026877120_0023_4:0.0000:was a debate between two poets, and the alba (Fr. auhe,
cu31924026877120_0023_5:0.0000:aubade) a dialogue between two lovers at the break of day.
cu31924026877120_0023_6:0.0000:Every reader of Dafydd will at once recognise how closely
cu31924026877120_0023_7:0.0250:related these Provencal forms are to a large number of his
cu31924026877120_0023_9:0.0500:Of all the Troubadours Dafydd's nearest poetical kins-
cu31924026877120_0023_10:0.0250:man is, unquestionably, Bernart of Ventadorn (flor. 1148-
cu31924026877120_0023_11:0.0250:1195). "Full of life himself and of a temper essentially
cu31924026877120_0023_12:0.0000:happy", writes Smith,' "it was the blithe and hearty side
cu31924026877120_0023_13:0.0250:of creation that appealed to Bernart. 'AH that is', he
cu31924026877120_0023_14:0.0000:cried — 'AH that is gives itself up to joy, and chants and
cu31924026877120_0023_15:0.0000:sings aloud, fields and parks and gardens, valley, plain,
cu31924026877120_0023_16:0.0000:and wood.' Sadness he often felt and could express
cu31924026877120_0023_17:0.0000:with vivid figures — the withering foliage, the cold and
cu31924026877120_0023_18:0.0250:stormy days, the ship tossing in the waves, the fish
cu31924026877120_0023_19:0.0250:struggling on the hook, the victim consumed by flames ;
cu31924026877120_0023_20:0.0500:but his songs of joy and exultation were more spontaneous
cu31924026877120_0023_21:0.0000:and more original, and in this mood his thoughts dwelt
cu31924026877120_0023_22:0.0000:lovingly on the gentle spring-time, the clear, bright
cu31924026877120_0023_23:0.0000:weather, the soft green of the fields, the tender verdure of
cu31924026877120_0023_24:0.0000:the boughs, the swelling buds, the blossoms opening behind
cu31924026877120_0023_25:0.0000:the leaves, the many-coloured flowers, and the gay little
cu31924026877120_0023_26:0.0000:birds— long silent— that began to sing again in the trees.
cu31924026877120_0023_27:0.0000:But all this was only the background, and upon it he
cu31924026877120_0023_28:0.0000:painted the feelings and the thoughts of the lover in hues
cu31924026877120_0023_29:0.0000:the truest, the freshest, the most varied that a poet has
cu31924026877120_0023_30:0.0000:ever used. Here, transmuted into thought and sentiment,
cu31924026877120_0023_31:0.0000:we find again the colour and perfume of the rose, the
cu31924026877120_0023_32:0.0250:music of the nightingale, and the genial splendour of the

cu31924026877120_0028_30:0.0500:3 "There are several very celebrated Provencal poems of this kind,
cu31924026877120_0028_31:0.0000:as, for instance, the dialogue between Eaimbaut d'Orange and his
cu31924026877120_0028_32:0.0250:mistress Beatrix, Countess of Die ; and that between Peyrols and

cu31924026877120_0030_1:0.0500:becomes a fierce and vituperative debate. The original
cu31924026877120_0030_2:0.0500:model of the tenso is the pastoral singing-match of
cu31924026877120_0030_7:0.0250:praising their several mistresses. The Proven 9al tenso,
cu31924026877120_0030_8:0.0000:however, became something much more elaborate than the
cu31924026877120_0030_9:0.0000:conventional singing-match as we find it in Theocritus or
cu31924026877120_0030_10:0.0250:Virgil. A closer parallel to the pastoral singing-match is
cu31924026877120_0030_11:0.0000:what was known to the Troubadours as the joa partit or
cu31924026877120_0030_12:0.0250:partimen. "In the tenso the poets spoke their real
cu31924026877120_0030_13:0.0250:sentiments and ideas, and very likely each wrote a whole
cu31924026877120_0030_14:0.0500:poem. The partimen was to the tenso like the tournament
cu31924026877120_0030_15:0.0000:to the battle. One poet proposed a debatable question,
cu31924026877120_0030_16:0.0250:and allowed the other disputant to choose his side ; they
cu31924026877120_0030_17:0.0250:then composed stanzas in turn.'" Dafydd ap Gwilym's
cu31924026877120_0030_18:0.0250:poetical debates, or cywyddau ymryson, with G-ruffydd Gryg
cu31924026877120_0030_19:0.0000:are quite in the style of the Proven9al tensos. The bard
cu31924026877120_0030_20:0.0250:probably engaged in many such bouts during his lifetime,
cu31924026877120_0030_21:0.0000:and in one of his odes,^ in reply to Gruffydd Gryg, he tells
cu31924026877120_0030_22:0.0000:us that he once exercised his powers of bardic repartee
cu31924026877120_0030_23:0.0250:upon one E.hys Meigen, with such effect that his rival
cu31924026877120_0030_24:0.0250:died of the shock. The poem that did the execution is
cu31924026877120_0030_25:0.0250:included in the printed editions of his works.'
cu31924026877120_0030_26:0.0500:Yet another type of Proven9al poem which has its
cu31924026877120_0030_29:0.0500:poem of praise or censure ; public or private ; personal,
cu31924026877120_0031_27:0.0250:1 Smith, The Troubadours at Home, ii, p. 449. " In replying to a
cu31924026877120_0031_28:0.0000:sirvente, a poet was bound to use the same form. Special forms of
cu31924026877120_0031_29:0.0000:the sirvente were the Lament (Planh), which was original with the
cu31924026877120_0031_30:0.0000:Troubadours, and the crusading-song. A piece specially composed for
cu31924026877120_0031_31:0.0000:a joglar might be called sirventes joglar esc. The sirvente was originally
cu31924026877120_0031_32:0.0000:composed, it is now held, by a sirvent, i.e., a paid soldier of adventure,
cu31924026877120_0031_33:0.0000:as the joglar was a paid entertainer. This is probably the correct
cu31924026877120_0031_34:0.0000:explanation of the name, a point much debated. As Jeanroy says,
cu31924026877120_0031_35:0.0000:about every event of importance to the Midi from 1150 until almost
cu31924026877120_0031_36:0.0000:1300 left its mark in the sirventes of the time." Smith, it will be
cu31924026877120_0031_37:0.0250:seen, coins an English word " sirvente " from the original sirventes.

cu31924026877120_0032_6:0.0250:thereon swallowed up all such as pleased him." Passages
cu31924026877120_0032_7:0.0000:such as these breathe the fervour of a genuine moral
cu31924026877120_0032_8:0.0000:indignation, and Cardinal, the greatest satirist among the
cu31924026877120_0032_9:0.0250:Troubadours, was a reformer who waged deliberate war
cu31924026877120_0032_10:0.0000:against the religious and social abuses of his day. Dafydd
cu31924026877120_0032_11:0.0000:ap Gwilym had little, if any, of the moral passion which
cu31924026877120_0032_12:0.0000:inspired Cardinal, or Langland, to denounce the black
cu31924026877120_0032_13:0.0000:sheep of the Church. His was more the temper of
cu31924026877120_0032_14:0.0250:Boccaccio and Chaucer, and monks and friars were to him
cu31924026877120_0032_15:0.0000:objects of good-humoured contempt i-ather than of any
cu31924026877120_0032_16:0.0000:profound moral antipathy. His amours brought him into.,
cu31924026877120_0032_17:0.0000:constant conflict with envious priests, and it is in frank
cu31924026877120_0032_18:0.0000:defence of his own "natural religion" that he taunts them
cu31924026877120_0032_19:0.0000:with their hypocrisies and lies. The maid who is exhorted
cu31924026877120_0032_20:0.0000:to leave her nunnery and to "win a soul" by making him
cu31924026877120_0032_21:0.0250:happy in the dingle "does nothing worse than what they
cu31924026877120_0032_22:0.0000:do at Rome or at St. James's (of Compostella) ".' There
cu31924026877120_0032_23:0.0000:is "a religion of the greenwood and of the cuckoo" as well
cu31924026877120_0032_24:0.0000:as "the religion of the monks of Rome".^ "God is not so
cu31924026877120_0032_25:0.0000:cruel as old men affirm : it is the priests, reading their
cu31924026877120_0032_26:0.0000:mouldy sheepskins, who tell us lies."' So he bids the
cu31924026877120_0032_27:0.0250:priests do their worst. Let them curse him with bell,
cu31924026877120_0032_28:0.0250:book, and candle, if they will ; he will take his chance of
cu31924026877120_0032_29:0.0000:salvation with the best of them. "God will never damn a

cu31924026877120_0033_9:0.0500:Cowell ( Y Cymmrodor, ii, p. 107) discovers in a Provenfal poem that
cu31924026877120_0033_10:0.0000:would come under this name some lines which furnish what he calls
cu31924026877120_0033_11:0.0000:'a curious parallel" to a passage in one of Dafydd's odes. "It may

cu31924026877120_0034_31:0.0000:dating back beyond the seventh century of our era, a curious parallel
cu31924026877120_0034_32:0.0000:to these medieval morning-songs. The extract, given in a Latin
cu31924026877120_0034_33:0.0000:translation, is a dialogue between a king and his queen at break of
cu31924026877120_0034_34:0.0500:day. The queen hears the cock crow, and the king replies that " it
cu31924026877120_0034_35:0.0250:was not the cock, but the hum of flies". "In the east the dawn
cu31924026877120_0034_36:0.0000:appears", the queen rejoins, " and there is already the stir of men in
cu31924026877120_0034_37:0.0500:royal halls." "Nay", says the king, "it is not the dawn, but the light
cu31924026877120_0034_38:0.0500:of the rising moon." "But the hum of flies on the wing grows
cu31924026877120_0035_16:0.0250:and he were together at break of day, and how the fear of
cu31924026877120_0035_17:0.0000:the husband — Biddig, "the jealous one" — ^fell upon him
cu31924026877120_0035_18:0.0000:as he watched the light increasing. Morfudd seeks to
cu31924026877120_0035_19:0.0250:quiet him with the assurance that, were day near, they
cu31924026877120_0035_20:0.0000:would have heard the cock crow. "But I see the daylight",
cu31924026877120_0035_21:0.0250:the bard cries, "peeping under the door." "That", Mor-
cu31924026877120_0035_22:0.0250:fudd rejoins, "is the newly-risen moon, and the stars that
cu31924026877120_0035_23:0.0000:shoot their beams between the pillars." "Nay rather, my
cu31924026877120_0035_24:0.0000:fair one, 'tis the sun in his splendour — pardee, 'tis a good
cu31924026877120_0035_25:0.0000:hour of the day!" "How fickle are thy ways! Take thy
cu31924026877120_0035_26:0.0250:choice, and depart!" In another poem^ the mistress it is
cu31924026877120_0035_27:0.0250:who first becomes restive and points to the advancing
cu31924026877120_0035_28:0.0000:louder", the queen protests, and insists that her consort should rise
cu31924026877120_0035_29:0.0250:lest he should " incur the reproach of others on her account." Cora-

cu31924026877120_0035_32:0.0250:form of song common to many countries, and hence not very ex-

cu31924026877120_0036_2:0.0000:what they see is "the inoon and its attendant stars".

cu31924026877120_0036_4:0.0250:truth ; but why croaks the crow up above?" The bard's
cu31924026877120_0036_5:0.0250:further protestations are cut short by a peremptory com-
cu31924026877120_0036_6:0.0000:mand to "cease from his shifts", and to make good his
cu31924026877120_0036_7:0.0250:escape before some spy should waylay him. These dia-
cu31924026877120_0036_8:0.0500:logues, like that in Romeo and Juliet, are but variations on
cu31924026877120_0036_9:0.0000:the theme of the Proven9al alba, and reproduce the stock
cu31924026877120_0036_10:0.0000:devices of the dawning light, the warning bird, and the
cu31924026877120_0036_11:0.0000:nearness of the jealous husband. Compare the following
cu31924026877120_0036_12:0.0250:lines from the famous morning-song of Giraut de
cu31924026877120_0036_13:0.0000:Borneil: — "Fair comrade, whether you sleep or wake,
cu31924026877120_0036_14:0.0000:sleep no more ; sleep no more, sweetly wake, for in the
cu31924026877120_0036_15:0.0000:east I see the star waxed that brings the day, for well have
cu31924026877120_0036_16:0.0250:I marked it; and soon will come the dawn." "JPair com-
cu31924026877120_0036_17:0.0250:rade, in singing I call you ; sleep no more, for I hear sing
cu31924026877120_0036_18:0.0000:the bird that goes looking for day through the copse, and
cu31924026877120_0036_19:0.0000:I fear lest the jealous one assail you ; and soon will come
cu31924026877120_0036_20:0.0000:the dawn." "Fair comrade, come to the window and
cu31924026877120_0036_21:0.0250:behold the stars of the sky; you will perceive whether T
cu31924026877120_0036_22:0.0000:am a faithful messenger to you. If you do it not, yours
cu31924026877120_0036_23:0.0000:will be the harm from it, and soon will come the dawn."^

cu31924026877120_0036_32:0.0500:Minnesingers will be found in Stern's learned and exhaustive study
cu31924026877120_0036_34:0.0500:Philologie (vii Band, 1 Heft, 1909), in the section entitled
cu31924026877120_0037_1:0.0500:and, above all, in the profuse wealth of their imagery, his
cu31924026877120_0037_2:0.0000:love-songs far surpass anything to be found in Proven9al
cu31924026877120_0037_3:0.0000:poetry, while his poems of Nature evince a quickness of
cu31924026877120_0037_4:0.0000:perception, a power of vivid description, and a passionate
cu31924026877120_0037_5:0.0000:delight in the wild life of the fields and the woods which
cu31924026877120_0037_6:0.0250:are altogether foreign to the songs of the Troubadours.
cu31924026877120_0037_7:0.0000:Not one of them has sung of Nature in strains which
cu31924026877120_0037_8:0.0000:suggest even the barest lines of a serious comparison with
cu31924026877120_0037_9:0.0000:the songs of Dafydd.' He had, in the words of the old
cu31924026877120_0037_10:0.0500:Welsh Triad, "an eye to see Nature, a heart to feel Nature,
cu31924026877120_0037_11:0.0000:and the daring to follow Nature". Proven9al poetry was
cu31924026877120_0037_12:0.0000:altogether too artificial and exotic a product to conform to
cu31924026877120_0037_13:0.0000:this precept. Much of the poetry of the Kymry is no less
cu31924026877120_0037_14:0.0000:artificial and conventional and monotonous than that of
cu31924026877120_0037_15:0.0000:the Troubadours ; and Dafydd stands in striking contrast
cu31924026877120_0037_16:0.0000:even to his Welsh predecessors and contemporaries as a
cu31924026877120_0037_17:0.0000:poet of Nature. But "what worlds away" he is from the
cu31924026877120_0037_18:0.0000:Troubadours when he sings of Nature, as he saw and felt
cu31924026877120_0037_19:0.0000:her in his careless rambles along the vales and the hills
cu31924026877120_0037_20:0.0000:of his native country ! For the Proven9al poets, " the
cu31924026877120_0037_21:0.0250:natural world", writes Smith, " had not yet opened its
cu31924026877120_0037_22:0.0500:unending vistas of significance : and while the Troubadours
cu31924026877120_0037_23:0.0250:were not without a keen sense of the beauties of nature,
cu31924026877120_0037_24:0.0000:they were too much a part of nature themselves to study
cu31924026877120_0037_25:0.0000:and enjoy her deeply, and their eyes, like their minds,
cu31924026877120_0037_26:0.0000:lacked the generations of experience and culture absolutely
cu31924026877120_0037_27:0.0000:needed to make them see the natural world artistically."^
cu31924026877120_0037_28:0.0000:Dafydd ap Gwilym had no more " experience and culture"
cu31924026877120_0037_29:0.0000:than they, but he did "see", and sing of, "the natural
cu31924026877120_0037_30:0.0250:1 " It is noteworthy that while the Troubadours use more or less
cu31924026877120_0037_31:0.0000:frequently a nature-picture as an introduction to a piece, only three —
cu31924026877120_0037_32:0.0000:B. de Ventadorn, G. de Borneil, and P. Vidal — refer to nature in the
cu31924026877120_0037_33:0.0000:body of a song ; and these references are slight." — Smith, Troubadours

cu31924026877120_0038_3:0.0000:measure and the quality of bis art. Later poets have
cu31924026877120_0038_4:0.0000:turned to Nature for a " message", a " religion", a
cu31924026877120_0038_5:0.0250:"philosophy". Dafydd, as we have seen, knew of "a
cu31924026877120_0038_6:0.0250:religion of the greenwood", and formed a most original
cu31924026877120_0038_7:0.0250:conception of its rites and its creed. But bis paramount
cu31924026877120_0038_8:0.0000:distinction and charm as a poet of Nature consists in his
cu31924026877120_0038_9:0.0000:absolutely unclouded vision, and in his direct expression of
cu31924026877120_0038_10:0.0000:what he himself saw and beard, thought and felt. "I can-
cu31924026877120_0038_11:0.0250:not keep silence", be cries in one poem, "any more than
cu31924026877120_0038_12:0.0000:the nightingale on the tree, even though my song be
cu31924026877120_0038_13:0.0250:unrequited."' AJl true poetry of Nature obeys the same
cu31924026877120_0038_18:0.0000:poetry of Provence and of Wales would be incomplete
cu31924026877120_0038_19:0.0000:without a passing reference to the literary fellowship
cu31924026877120_0038_20:0.0000:which, quite unconsciously on either side, prevails between
cu31924026877120_0038_21:0.0000:the two countries even to-day. Just as in Wales the
cu31924026877120_0038_22:0.0000:best living bards continue to work in the tradition of
cu31924026877120_0038_23:0.0250:Dafydd ap Gwilym, so in Provence are there " modern

cu31924026877120_0039_1:0.0250:modern Provence, is an institution curiously resembling
cu31924026877120_0039_2:0.0000:the Welsh Eisteddfod, and the felibres are as sedulous

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0004_0:0.0000:FOR JUDITH
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_0:0.0250:PREFACE
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_1:0.0250:Even today there probably are more students of literature
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_2:0.0000:who know that apocryphal story according to which Dryden is sup-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_3:0.0250:posed once to have told his young relative, "Cousin Swift, you will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_4:0.0000:never be a poet,' than there are students who can correctly quote
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_5:0.0000:one line of Swift's poetry. But this almost traditional neglect of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_6:0.0250:Swift's poetry is giving way to a new interest and even as I write
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_7:0.0000:this preface there are other students in other places and in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_8:0.0000:increasing numbers who are reading, and writing about Swift's verse.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_9:0.0000:Happily, this dissertation is only a small part of a much larger
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_10:0.0000:re- examination of Swift's poetry which, begun in the early 1950' s,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_11:0.0250:has each year since then precipitated more--and more careful--essays
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_12:0.0000:that examine the force and value of Swift's poetry. Therefore,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_13:0.0000:although I increasingly feel my own inadequacy as an explicator
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_14:0.0000:of Swift's poetry, I also grow increasingly sure that the attempt
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_17:0.0500:recently written, the most valuable, it has seemed to me, have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_18:0.0000:been those which have been confined to the explication of particular
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_19:0.0250:poems. Of course, we will ultimately need to make general state-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_20:0.0250:ments about Swift's poetic achievement and to place his work in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_21:0.0000:some just context. But many students must walk before one student
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0005_22:0.0250:can run, and general statements on the nature of Swift's verse,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_0:0.0000:a backlog of poems understood. In the meantime, careful and thought-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_1:0.0250:ful essays, such as Peter Ohlin's examination of Cadenus and Vanessa '^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_2:0.0250:or Marshall Waingrow's subtle reading of Verses on the Death of Dr.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_3:0.0000:Swift, D.S.P.D. -^ have done more both to illuminate the actual nature
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_4:0.0000:of Swift's poetry and to dispel the charges of misanthropy and ob-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_5:0.0250:scenity which have darkened our view of that poetry than have those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_6:0.0000:more general overviews of Swift's poetry which have recently appeared.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_7:0.0000:Feeling this way, I have, of course, written the four chap-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_8:0.0000:ters of this dissertation as individual examinations of four particular
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_9:0.0000:poems. Each chapter is written to stand by itself and, indeed, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_10:0.0000:four poems considered in these chapters have been chosen specifically
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_11:0.0000:to illustrate the variousness of Swift's poetic achievement. But,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_12:0.0000:though these four poems, written at three distinct periods in Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_13:0.0250:life and on four quite different subjects, were chosen for their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_14:0.0250:variety of manner and matter, they somehow are all tenaciously
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_15:0.0250:characteristic of Swift, and share some things unmistakably in com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_16:0.0250:mon. Therefore, although there are enough unhappy examples to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_17:0.0000:make one very aware of the danger in freely generalizing about
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_18:0.0250:Swift's verse, I offer the following very brief and very broad
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_19:0.0000:remarks about his verse, not, certainly, as a positive thesis, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_20:0.0000:only as tentative landmarks in a country not yet very well known.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_21:0.0250:To observe that Swift was, all of his life, an omnivorous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_22:0.0000:reader is to begin with what is well enough known. ^ What is not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_23:0.0250:nearly as well known, however, is how much of what Swift read he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_24:0.0250:re-directed back into his own verse. For, although too many of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_25:0.0250:Swift's readers have apparently agreed with Samuel Johnson's opinion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0006_26:0.0250:that, "the peruser of Swift wants little previous knowledge; it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_0:0.0500:will be sufficient that he is acquainted with common words and common
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_2:0.0500:Often enough, however, the almost traditional failure to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_3:0.0000:see how much borrowed material Swift has re- incorporated into his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_4:0.0250:own poetry is more than understandable, for Swift was frequently
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_5:0.0250:coy about this technique. There are many borrowed lines in Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_6:0.0000:verse which are so skillfully fitted to their new text that only a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_7:0.0000:very strong memory or a lucky hit is likely to detect them. Thus,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_8:0.0000:for example, it is not at all surprising that for years it went
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_9:0.0250:unnoticed that Swift's proclamation of his own originality in Verses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_20:0.0000:in the way we understand them. Appearing at first to be only a piece
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_21:0.0000:of pointless boasting, these lines prove, once their source is known,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_22:0.0000:to be a subtle comment on the nature of originality by being themselves
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_23:0.0000:an illustration of the paradox that Denham describes. Here, then,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_24:0.0000:as so often in Swift's poems, meaning resides precisely in the con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0007_27:0.0500:VI
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_0:0.0000:No technique, I think, is either more common or more crucial
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_1:0.0000:to Swift's poetry than is this penchant of his to pour old wine into
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_2:0.0250:new bottles. For Swift did not confine this technique to simply
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_3:0.0250:borrowing whole lines and placing them within his poems. Rather,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_4:0.0000:Swift could, as we shall see, borrow only a few scattered words
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_5:0.0250:from Milton's Paradise Lost and yet make them suggest, in his Ode
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_6:0.0000:to Sancroft . the relevance of Milton's theodicy to his own ode.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_7:0.0000:Or, on the other hand. Swift could borrow the entire form of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_8:0.0250:seventeenth century meditatio mortis and then build his own Verses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_9:0.0000:on the Death of Dr. Swift, D.S.P.D. within that form. But in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_10:0.0000:either case what we ultimately see is Swift forming through allusici,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_11:0.0000:imitation and direct quotation, the very meaning of his poetry from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_12:0.0000:the contrast between the materials he borrows and the uses ne makes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_13:0.0000:of it. Finally, that is. Swift's poetic genius-- the peculiar
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_14:0.0250:originality he imparted to his poetry--was best defined by Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_15:0.0000:himself when he, ingeniously re-working Denham's lines, made them
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_16:0.0500:"all his own."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_18:0.0000:fortunate that there has been a tendency on the part of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_19:0.0000:critics to huddle all the instances of Swift's borrowings that they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_20:0.0000:have noticed under the simplistic title of parody. For to label
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_21:0.0250:Swift's poetry as parody does not explain it; it is only to assume
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_22:0.0000:that Swift had no better use for any of the materials he re- incor-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_23:0.0000:porates in his own verse than to make them look silly. The result
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_24:0.0250:of such criticism has been that even when Swift's borrowing has
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_25:0.0250:been detected it has usually been badly misunderstood. Thus, for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0008_26:0.0250:example, generations of critics have understood Swift's On Poetry:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_0:0.0250:A Rapsody as being an attack upon the "cant" of "poetic inspiration."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_1:0.0250:Or again, Cadenus and Vanessa has been understood--apart from its
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_6:0.0250:this. For, just because these poems--like most of Swift's poetry-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_7:0.0250:are written within earshot of other men's verses and thus reflect
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_8:0.0250:a wide range of human values, they must mean complexly. Indeed,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_9:0.0250:even when Swift's poetry comes closest to being what Swift's critics
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_10:0.0250:have pretty generally said it is--a kind of anti-poetry' that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_11:0.0250:savagely parodies the "softer" or "finer" feelings which are usually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_12:0.0250:thought of as poetic--even then, I think there is embedded in Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_13:0.0500:very parody not only Swift's willingness to tell a harsh truth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_14:0.0500:when it is needed but also his recognition, sometimes almost wist-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_15:0.0250:ful, that the truth he is telling is harsh. Thus, even when Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_16:0.0250:parodies the material which he borrows, the material continues to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_17:0.0500:ramify and complicate his meaning. For, ultimately. Swift's parody
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_18:0.0250:only suggests what all the other effects of Swift's collage- like
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_19:0.0250:poetry suggests; that the world with which Swift's poetry grapples
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_20:0.0250:is not a simple one. It is, rather, a world of gain and loss, of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_21:0.0250:constant and necessary adjustments, a world where quotations must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_22:0.0500:be measured by other quotations, men by other men, and values by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0009_23:0.0500:other values, in order that so much of the truth as men do know
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0010_0:0.0250:more kindness than I can acknowledge. My fellow students, Mr. J.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0010_2:0.0250:Mr. James G. Richardson III and Mr. Lawrence P. Vonalt have all
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0010_3:0.0250:been both helpful and patient. My seniors, Mr. J. David Walker
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0010_4:0.0000:and Mr. C. Earl Ramsey have taught me much by precept ana more

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0012_3:0.0500:One Ode to Dr. William Sancroft 1
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0012_4:0.0500:Two Cadenus and Vanessa 36
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_3:0.0250:In 1689 Jonathan Swift, then twenty-one, began to compose
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_4:0.0000:that series of poems, usually called the "early odes," which are che
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_5:0.0000:first of his known literary productions. The scyle of criese odes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_6:0.0000:has usually been condemned and, indeed, their cra.-.,jea and sometir.;es
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_7:0.0000:cryptic manner does often obscure their sense, ^ut cramped and cryp-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_8:0.0000:tic though these early odes are, they have, I thi.ik, a wider scope
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_9:0.0000:and demonstrate a deeper understanding than has so far beea recognizea.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_10:0.0000:They are the poems of a very young man, it is true, but a young mc.n
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_16:0.0500:gated course of reading he came to admire the poetry of Abraham Cowley
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_17:0.0250:and, as Swift matured into his twenties and composed his "early odes,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_19:0.0500:youthful admiration for Cowley that, in a letter written to Thomas
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0013_26:0.0000:poems have certainly been far from enthusiastic. Even Irvin Ehrenpreis,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_7:0.0250:Many another critic has rendered the same judgment ia cerms which are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_8:0.0250:both less graceful and less precise, and most, I suppose, would agree
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_9:0.0000:with Ehrenpreis' final judgment that Swift, already in nis middle
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_10:0.0000:twenties, was rather too old to attribute to mere mortals "such in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_11:0.0000:candescent perfections as Swift lent to nis subjects."^ But, although
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_12:0.0000:Swift's apparently over-inflated celebrations of his subject's virtue
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_13:0.0000:have irritated almost every reader of his early odes, these celebrations
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_14:0.0000:are, I believe, the most significant element of those odes. To under-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_15:0.0000:stand these celebrations, however, we will have to briefly examine
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_16:0.0000:first a characteristic of Pindar's odes, and then the development of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_17:0.0500:that characteristic in the pindarique odes of Swift's model, Abraham
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_18:0.0500:Cowley.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_19:0.0000:Pindar's odes, written in celebration of specific victors in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_20:0.0000:the Greek games, portray two related but partly opposed views of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_21:0.0000:human situation. On the one hand the odes were composed to celebrate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_22:0.0000:a victor at the height of his success, at a moment when he is a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_23:0.0000:type--indeed, seems almost the equal of--the gods and heroes for whose
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_24:0.0000:honor the Greek games existed. Cowley's translation of the first four
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_25:0.0250:lines of Pindar's Second Olympiad makes Pindar's celebration of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0014_26:0.0250:god-like potentialities of man perfectly clear.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_6:0.0500:cal subject faces his greatest danger, and so Pindar must warn his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_7:0.0250:subject against the deadly sin of pride. That is why, in Pindar's odes,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_8:0.0250:"however great men's golden triumphs may seem, thoughts of the gods'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_10:0.0250:Of this second aspect of Pindar, Coxvley himself, apparently,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_12:0.0250:Olympiad , warns its subject, Theron, against pride by reminding him
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0015_13:0.0250:of the fate of his great ancestor, Oedipus, Cowley, in the notes which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_3:0.0250:Andbecause Cowley did respond, to a degree, to both aspects of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_4:0.0250:Pindar, and because, as a Christian, Cowley had at least as pro-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_5:0.0000:found a sense as Pindar himself both that man was formed in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_6:0.0000:image of God and yet that man was capable of falling away from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_7:0.0250:God, he was able, in the last of his pindarique odes, to work an
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_8:0.0250:interesting and impressive variation on Pindar. What he did was
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_9:0.0000:to versify, in the form of the pindarique ode, sections from the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_10:0.0500:Old Testament which emphasize both the potential glory and the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_20:0.0500:was hardly a new poetic theme when Cowley employed it, of course.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_21:0.0250:Cowley's contribution was simply that he recognized the theme
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_22:0.0000:as the natural link between Pindar's odes and the interests of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_23:0.0250:his own age, thus teaching many. Swift among them, the use of a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_24:0.0250:genre new to them.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0016_25:0.0250:Swift's odes all, following Cowley's, are made to focus on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_2:0.0250:be equally meaningless in both cases. Rather than make such charges
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_5:0.0500:For this purpose Swift's Ode to Dr. William Bancroft serves
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_6:0.0000:better, for two reasons, than any of the other odes. First, it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_7:0.0250:alone among the odes seems to have been in a state of composition
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_8:0.0000:and revision from 1689 to 1593, that is, during the entire time
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_9:0.0250:Swift was busying himself about these odes. Second, perhaps
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_10:0.0250:because this ode apparently cost him more trouble than any of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_11:0.0000:others, the theological assumptions from which Swift constructed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_12:0.0500:all his models of perfection and all his pictures of ruin are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_13:0.0500:closer to the surface in the Ode to Sancroft than in any other of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_14:0.0000:the six early odes.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_17:0.0000:of Swift's poems, that the entire theme of the Ode to Sancroft "is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_18:0.0000:truth," and thus Horrell joined that small group of critics who have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_19:0.0000:hazarded, in print, a guess at the ode's meaning which was not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_20:0.0250:intended to bludgeon Swift with his own ode. True, the remark
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_21:0.0250:seems rather oracular, coming as it does with no further explication
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_22:0.0000:or justification, but it is, nevertheless, among the first which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0017_23:0.0500:indicate that the ode may be something more than a badly over-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_0:0.0000:Irvin Ehrenpreis, despite his evident annoyance with much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_1:0.0250:of the poem, carried analysis of it a step further by observing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_2:0.0000:that the poem's nominal subject, Bancroft, is meant by Swift to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_3:0.0250:emblemize "Truth.' But Ehrenpreis feels that the Bancroft of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_4:0.0000:the poem, laboring as the earthly, "image of eternal truth," often
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_5:0.0000:sunk under that unnatural load. Consequently he did not pursue
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_6:0.0250:further the grounds which the poem might provide for the connection
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_7:0.0250:of Bancroft and "Truth." Nor are the grounds of this connection
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_8:0.0500:explored in either of the only two other recent considerations of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_9:0.0000:the ode.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_11:0.0250:esting, although perhaps too constricted, observations on the poem.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_12:0.0250:Ronald Paulson examined the ode in an essay which analyzed Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_13:0.0500:position in a classic debate: the relationship of spirit to matter.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_14:0.0250:His intent is to demonstrate that Swift was, at heart, a dualist,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_15:0.0250:that Swift felt that everything of true worth was "other-worldly,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_17:0.0000:Sancrof t , Paulson argues, helps confirm this thesis, since in that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_18:0.0500:ode we actually see the "good" becoming "other-worldly."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0018_23:0.0500:There is much in the poem which seemingly recommends Paulson's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_4:0.0500:It may be felt, however, that Paulson's own position is too
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_5:0.0000:daring: to suggest that Swift, even at age twenty-six, is a dualist,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_6:0.0000:is perhaps to take too lightly Swifc's later comment respecting a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_7:0.0000:philosopher who, because he stared too constantly at the scars, 'found
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_8:0.0000:himself seduced by his lower Pares into a Ditch."* Further, there is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_9:0.0000:much in the ode icself which suggests that Paulsor.'s emphasis, at
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_10:0.0000:least, is in error. The truth which, afcer all. Swift bluntly states
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_11:0.0000:is available and appropriate to man is "That Heaven's high Son was in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_12:0.0250:a village born" (172), fully God and fully man, che spirit incarnated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_13:0.0250:in the flesh.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_15:0.0000:than any other criuicism I have seen to my own view of che poem. She
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_16:0.0000:argues cr.ac, in Swift's view, the foolishness and knavery of which men
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_17:0.0000:are guilty, and which serve to make a world of "gidcy circuivistances ,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_18:0.0000:all derive from man's desire to be that which he is not. A creature
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_19:0.0000:of but feeble understanding and feebler will, man insists on spinning
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_20:0.0250:out the guts of his own authority presumptuously rigid systems:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_21:0.0000:this poor creature, man, would, if he could, make himself the measure
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0019_22:0.0250:of all truth. That such presumption is one of the dominant themes of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_5:0.0250:than is to be found elsewhere. Swift's real theme is the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_6:0.0250:impossibility of succeeding in such an attempt. ...In
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_7:0.0250:the Ode to Sancroft the bishop's "secret regular sphere"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_8:0.0500:is misunderstood and appears of irregular motion co che
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_9:0.0250:"strong and num'rous" fools, and its effect [oa ci., the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_10:0.0000:poem's readers] is secondary to that made by such phrases
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_11:0.0250:as "our weak kaowiddge," "opinion dark and blind," "con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_12:0.0250:tradiction's vorcex, " "crazy composition," and the recur-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_13:0.0250:ring "giddy" and "gic^^ily." In this poem Swift makes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_14:0.0000:overt use of religion comparisons, and hi; sense oi xan's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_15:0.0500:intellectual, moral, and spiritual confuoion is mosc
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_17:0.0500:As there was much m the ode wh^cn supported Paulson's viexv
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_19:0.0500:tions. But, as Paulson's argument that, in Swire's view^ cha "Gocc
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_20:0.0500:is ultimately "otlier-worldly" seemed shaky when posed against Swif c
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_21:0.0250:insistence "Tht.- Haaven's high Son was in a village born" (172), so
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_22:0.0250:^williiias' view tnac the ode's real theme, is the impossibility of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_23:0.0250:organizing experience in the shape of eternal truth seems co falter
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_24:0.0250:at the satr.i point. For, as we have noted, Swift insists that man
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_25:0.0250:misses the way to truth not because truth is completely unavailable
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_26:0.0250:to him nor because man is altogether too weak for it, but oecause
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_27:0.0250:man is perverse. Both Williams and Paulson, then, have isolated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_28:0.0250:real chemes in the poem; ic is concerned with both man's struggle
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_29:0.0500:with mind and body and wich man's tendency to over-reach and thus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_30:0.0250:weaken himself. But both these critics have pushed these themes to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0020_31:0.0500:the exclusion of everything else in the poem--and thus pushed the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_0:0.0000:To recapitulate: the poem's most recent critics have estab-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_1:0.0000:lished firmly at least some of the terms in which it must be discussed.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_2:0.0250:They have isolated, as its central theme, man's struggle to achieve
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_3:0.0000:some vision of the truth. But they have also, perhaps, shown the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_4:0.0000:poem to be more complex than they themselves realized. Swift's view
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_5:0.0250:of man's relation to eternal truth was, I think, more sophisticated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_6:0.0250:than their views of the poem. That is likely, of course, to be the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_7:0.0000:fate of any reading of so complex a poem, but perhaps we can proceed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_8:0.0000:more prudently, at least, by anchoring our discussion of the poem in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_9:0.0000:the question, what was there in Bancroft's life and circumstances which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_10:0.0250:called forth this poem from Swift?
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_13:0.0500:son of Francis Sandcroft (William dropped the "d" from the name).
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_14:0.0000:He attended grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds where, on the evidence
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_15:0.0000:of his own manuscripts dating from that time, he demonstrated an early
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_16:0.0000:aptitude for learning. He went up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_17:0.0250:1633, received his B.A. in 1637, his M.A. in 1641 and his B.D. in 1648.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_18:0.0000:He retained a fellowship there until 1651 and then, in 1657, went
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_19:0.0000:abroad where he remained until the restoration. On his return he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_20:0.0000:received, in rapid succession, the Mastership of Emmanuel College, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_21:0.0000:Deanery of York and the Deanery of St. Paul's. The latter post he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0021_22:0.0000:retained until 1678, during which time he was instrumental in the re-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_0:0.0500:10
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_2:0.0500:avoid a direct confrontation with James II over James' interference
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_3:0.0000:with ecclesiastical policy was shattered in 1688 when he, along with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_4:0.0250:six other bishops, refused to order his clergy to read James'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_5:0.0000:Declaration of Liberty of Conscience . In a petition to the king,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_6:0.0000:Bancroft defended his refusal as arising not from "any want of tender-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_7:0.0250:ness to dissenters," but from his own conviction that James' Declaration ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_8:0.0000:being founded on nothing more than James' assumed kingly prerogative to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_9:0.0000:govern as he wished, usurped such power as might "at pleasure put aside
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_10:0.0000:all laws ecclesiastical and civil." Therefore, Bancroft concluded,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_11:0.0250:the Declaration "appeared to be illegal."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_13:0.0000:and brought to trial at the end of June. Their defense was conducted
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_14:0.0000:along the lines of the petition, and it was successful. But despite
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_15:0.0000:the general jubilation in London at the freeing of the seven, the die
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_16:0.0000:for Bancroft himself was cast. For, if he was unwilling to grant the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_17:0.0000:king "such dispensing power as may at pleasure put aside all laws ec-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_18:0.0000:clesiastical and civil," he was yet less willing to grant it to the con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_19:0.0000:vention which, in 1689, bestowed the throne on William of Orange.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_20:0.0000:Bancroft did not see how the convention's decision released him, who
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_21:0.0000:had himself annointed James II, from his oath of loyalty to that king.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_22:0.0250:Consequently, in February 1690-1691, Bancroft was deprived of his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_23:0.0000:position, and, because he chose to bring it to that point, was ejected
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_24:0.0000:by law in late June from Lambeth Castle. The remaining two years of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_25:0.0250:his life were spent in seclusion but not in quiet, for he dedicated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_26:0.0000:himself to securing the succession of what he considered to be England's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_27:0.0250:true church, a church comprised of men who, like himself, did not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0022_28:0.0500:swear their allegiance to William III. He was, of course, almost as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_3:0.0250:This sketch, brief as it is, serves to point out how very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_4:0.0000:little of Bancroft's actual life and character Swift chose to include
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_5:0.0000:in his ode. Indeed, even the very circumstances of Sancroft's depriva-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_6:0.0000:tion, which are the occasion of the ode, are referred to only obliquely.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_7:0.0000:Irvin Ehrenpreis has objected to the ode on the grounds chat Swi--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_8:0.0000:was unreasonably attempting to praise Sancroft, who refused co acknowl-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_9:0.0250:edge William III, while simultaneously praising William IIj.. But, this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_10:0.0000:is an objection which Ehrenpreis has had to bring from outside the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_11:0.0000:poem, for there is nothing in the poem which implies chat the two r:.eri
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_12:0.0000:were at odds. Swift has stripped Bancroft's deprivation of all the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_13:0.0250:historical circumstances reviewed above in order th^^t what Swifc felt
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_14:0.0250:to be its real significance might appear more clearly. For us txi u.nder-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_15:0.0000:stand that significance, however, we shall have to exauiine a crucial
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_16:0.0250:part of the circumstances of Sancroft's conduct more carefully.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_17:0.0500:The revolutionary settlement of 1689, to which Sancroft was
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_18:0.0000:asked to put his hand, in effect rendered the doctrine of the divine
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_19:0.0000:hereditary right of kings a dead letter as English political theory. •'■
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_20:0.0000:Of course, the divine right of kinys to reign, if it really exists,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_21:0.0000:cannot be circumvented--it rests upon a principle which Swift himself
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_22:0.0250:stated years later in his sermon. Doing Good , "It is apparent from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_23:0.0000:Scripture, and most agreeable to reason, that the safety and welfare
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_24:0.0250:of nations are under the most peculiar care of God's providence."'^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_25:0.0500:Since, that is, there is either such a thing as God's providence, or
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_26:0.0500:there is not, and if there is, and if William is king, it must follow
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0023_27:0.0500:that he is king through God's will, no matter by what means. This,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_1:0.0500:since he held that William was king, and that providence was operative,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_2:0.0000:was presumably Swift's own view. It may well have been Bancroft's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_3:0.0250:view too; at least, Bancroft did nothing to actually oppose William,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_4:0.0000:But that did not mean that Bancroft would second the action of a con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_5:0.0000:vention which had claimed-- first by voting the English throne vacant,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_6:0.0000:and then voting to fill it-- that the power to make and unmake kings
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_7:0.0250:did not operate through them, but originated with them. To Bancroft,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_8:0.0000:setting his hand to this work of the convention was striking at the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_9:0.0000:very life of the church. For, from his point of view, the convention,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_10:0.0000:in seeking to limit the authority of the king, had actually presumed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_11:0.0000:to eliminate the authority of God from the civil acts of man.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_12:0.0250:In the Ode to Bancroft , Bwift traces, in a multitude of in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_13:0.0000:stances, such foolish, prideful, dangerous and yet ludicrously piti-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_14:0.0250:able attempts of man to reach truth after having removed himself from ^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_15:0.0250:the eye and will of God. In each of these instances Swift illumi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_16:0.0000:nates the contradictory and impossible nature of such an attempt.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_17:0.0250:Bancroft, for having resisted such attempts in a crucial instance,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_18:0.0000:for his insistence that a just and true government cannot be achieved
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_19:0.0000:by attempting to reject the source of all truth, is the ode's image of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_20:0.0000:the truth which men may know.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_23:0.0250:and its allusions outside of the poem are clarified, the first stanza
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_24:0.0000:of the Ode to Bancroft is seen to reflect in small the entire meaning
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_25:0.0000:of the poem. But the stanza is best examined in stages, and initially
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0024_26:0.0250:it appears to suggest that neither truth nor any other heavenly virtue
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_4:0.0000:The very structure of the stanza seems to reflect this kind
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_5:0.0000:of dualism. The first six lines of the stanza salute "Truth" in a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_6:0.0000:glorious heaven; lines seven and eight contrast truth's fixity with the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_7:0.0000:"giddy circumstances" of "time" and "place"; the final seven lines
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_8:0.0000:darkly image this world and man's estate. By the interposition, then,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_9:0.0250:of time and place, the realms of heaven and earth are apparently
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_10:0.0000:rendered entirely separate. Further, the two dominant image patterns
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_11:0.0000:of the stanza, light versus dark and fixity versus motion, seem to af-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_12:0.0000:firm this separation between heaven and earth. The description of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_13:0.0000:heaven is filled with an imagery of light (bright effluence, chief
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_14:0.0000:lamp, light seest), while in the lines devoted to this world we meet
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_15:0.0000:only darkness (dark disputes, weak arguments and doubt). Similarly,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_16:0.0000:while heaven is described in the first stanza as constant and fixed,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_17:0.0000:the world of men which Swift pictures is rocked by random and destruc-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_18:0.0250:tive motion. Thus man, simply by being born a sublunary creature,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_19:0.0000:subject to night, time, place and motion seems (though only seems, I
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_20:0.0000:think) condemned, in this first stanza, to a life of constant disorder.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_21:0.0000:Apparently, it was just such an initial bleakly hopeless view of man's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_22:0.0000:condition as pictured in this ode that lead Paulson and Williams to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_23:0.0000:develop their particular readings of it.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_25:0.0250:of heaven and earth which seems so striking in this stanza is not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0025_26:0.0500:nearly as absolute as it first appears. For while Swift does, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_2:0.0500:do not seem to derive directly from either man's limitations or from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_3:0.0250:his sublunary status. Rather, the nature of these evils (dark disputes,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_4:0.0250:dagger contests, and battles) seems to type them as being evils of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_5:0.0500:man's own making. Thus, even as Swift powerfully depicts the wide
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_6:0.0000:disparity between heaven and earth, he suggests that this disparity
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_7:0.0500:is caused not by man's sublunary estate, but rather by his response
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_9:0.0000:It is precisely from man's response to his sublunary environ-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_10:0.0000:ment, from the cosmologies man has developed to understand and ex-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_11:0.0000:plain that environment, that Swift draws much of the imagery he uses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_12:0.0000:to describe man's usual befuddlement . Characteristically, in this ode,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_13:0.0000:human error is imaged as random and eccentric motion. Men expand their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_14:0.0250:minds through infinity of space in stanza four; grow in rank profusion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_15:0.0000:and disorder in stanza five; run pell mell into heresy in stanza eight.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_16:0.0000:And this confused motion is reminiscent. Swift notes in the fourth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_17:0.0250:stanza, of the completely inaccurate but wildly complicated startracks
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_22:0.0250:Cosmological confusion, that is, and particularly, as we shall see,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_23:0.0250:the giddy eccentricities of the Ptolemaic and Cartesian systems,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_24:0.0000:becomes, in this ode, a "type" of all human error. And what Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_25:0.0250:imagistic equation of human error with confused cosmologies suggests
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0026_26:0.0250:is that the giddy circumstances of time and place which, in the first
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_0:0.0500:15
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_2:0.0500:as simply as possible, I think we shall see that in this ode it is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_3:0.0500:man himself who is responsible for his own benighted and giddy cir-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_5:0.0500:Let us take, for example, Swift's poetic explanation for the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_6:0.0000:animosity with which most men regarded Bancroft's actions. It will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_7:0.0000:be remembered chat Bancroft was generally regarded in his own age as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_8:0.0250:a turncoat, one who, having staunchly defied Jamea II, iucongrously
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_9:0.0250:refused to support William III. In our examination Bancroft's ra^-sons
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_10:0.0000:for acting as he did seemed to be consistent, but. Swift explains, -o
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_11:0.0250:Elost of his contemporaries.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_15:0.0250:This (apparently obscure) explanation of the reason Sancxofc's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_16:0.0000:contemporaries mistakenly thought his course "irregular" follows im-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_17:0.0000:mediately after Swift's discussion of the PtoIeiViic system; and it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_18:0.0000:depends upon that discussion. As we have seen above. Swift knew that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_19:0.0000:the Ptolemaic system both inaccurately described the actual course of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_20:0.0250:heavenly bodies and was enormously, needlessly cor.".p Heated. Of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_21:0.0000:course, both the inaccuracies of the Ptolemaic system and its endless
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_22:0.0250:complications are caused by one, single, fundamental error. "Led on"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_23:0.0000:as Swift puts it, "by gross philosophy and pride"; Ptolemy, and those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_24:0.0000:who followed him, assumed that the earth--their observatory--was still.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_25:0.0000:From this proud error--the assumption that the earth was still while
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0027_26:0.0500:all else moved--springs all the "unthrifty motion" and "incoherent
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_1:0.0250:Among the other needless complexities of this system is the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_2:0.0250:elaborate mathematical schema Ptolemy and his successors devised in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_3:0.0000:order to account for the apparently irregular motion of the stars.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_4:0.0000:Of course, this apparent irregularity of starpath (technically called
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_5:0.0250:retrograde and as observable today as it was to Ptolemy) results
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_6:0.0000:simply from watching one moving body from another moving body. But
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_7:0.0000:if, like Ptolemy, one assumes one's own position to be a still point,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_8:0.0000:one will assume the observed irregularity of starpaths to be a pheno-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_9:0.0000:menon of the stars themselves. The point of Swift's lines on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_10:0.0000:Bancroft's critics then is that those critics, like P::olemy, er-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_11:0.0000:roneously assume their position to be stable and therefore wrongly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_12:0.0000:attribute an irregularity to Sancroft's accions. Like Ptolemy,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_13:0.0000:Bancroft's critics fall into giddy errors not because the phenomenon
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_14:0.0250:they are observing is either giddy or incomprehensible, but because
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_15:0.0000:triey are proud and unstable.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_16:0.0500:Successful as the lines discussed above are in illustrating
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_17:0.0250:man's propensity to stumble over his own pride ii\to giddy circum-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_18:0.0000:stances, nevertheless, to most of Swift's contemporaries the system
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_19:0.0000:which ideally illustrated that propensity was not the Ptolemaic but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0028_20:0.0250:rather the Cartesian system. ■'■^ And it is to Descar.tes' vortex cos-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0029_14:0.0500:system became an anathema to many in the seventeenth century; rather,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0029_25:0.0250:God's existence, he reasons Him both homeless and irrelevant. Descartes'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0029_26:0.0000:system, that is, portrays cosmologically that separation of man's es-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_3:0.0250:It should by now be rather obvious that those giddy circum-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_4:0.0000:stances which Swift portrays in the first stanza and throughout the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_5:0.0000:poem as darkening the human estate are not the necessary effects of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_6:0.0000:man's sublunary condition, but are, rather, the results of man's pre- "^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_7:0.0000:sumption. In fact, so far is the universe which Swift himself postu-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_8:0.0000:lates in this poem from being the giddy, dark and Godless cosmos
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_9:0.0000:Descartes' describes, that Swift's universe resembles instead that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_10:0.0000:universe which Henry More proposed in opposition to Descartes' system.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_11:0.0000:In More's cosmology, the most important fact of the physical universe
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_12:0.0000:is that God "is omnipresent and occupies intimately the whole machine. ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_13:0.0000:as well as its singular particles." -* And that God is actively present
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_14:0.0000:(though hidden) in His universe is exactly the point which Swift him-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_15:0.0000:self suggests through the two biblical echoes which, as we shall see,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_16:0.0250:he has incorporated in the first four lines of the Ode to Bancroft .
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_23:0.0250:cherub, and chief lamp of that high sacred Seven" which surround the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_24:0.0000:throne of God. The phrase "chief lamp of that high sacred seven"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_25:0.0000:may very well refer to a historical event we have already mentioned.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_26:0.0000:Bancroft, as the Archbishop of Canterbury, was the leading prelate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_27:0.0000:among the seven brought to trial by James II. But the origin of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0030_28:0.0500:image itself is, probably, the Book of Zechariah .
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_16:0.0250:Few chapters from Scripture might better refute the work of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_17:0.0000:the 1689 convention, which seemed to exclude God from the civil acts
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_18:0.0000:of men, than this from Zechariah . For it not only states that kings
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_19:0.0000:are kings by the will of God, its whole import is that God is always
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_20:0.0000:present and actively concerned in the affairs of men. Indeed, God's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_21:0.0000:active involvement with mankind is stressed most emphatically in this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_22:0.0000:chapter at that point when Zechariah, inquiring about the significance
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_23:0.0000:of those seven lamps which are the source of Swift's image, is told
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_24:0.0000:that those lamps are "the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0031_25:0.0000:through the whole earth."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_2:0.0000:both through its echo of Zechariah and, perhaps , in its reference to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_3:0.0250:Bancroft's successful trial, that not by might, nor by power, but by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_4:0.0000:God's spirit turn the affairs of men. Nor have we done with the line
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_5:0.0250:yet, for it reads in full, "Chief cherub, and chief lamp of that high
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_6:0.0250:sacred Seven." The vision of Zechariah does not, in fact, mention
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_7:0.0000:a cherub; but Milton, remembering that vision, describes the Archangel
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_16:0.0500:While Milton does not actually mention the seven lamps of Zechariah 's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_17:0.0250:vision and therefore could not have been the only source for Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_18:0.0250:third line, from Milton's imaginative yoking of Uriel with Zechariah's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_19:0.0000:vision comes, probably. Swift's "chief cherub." Swift, then, draws
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_20:0.0000:in this single line on both the Book of Zechariah and on Milton's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_21:0.0000:theodicy and thereby suggests that there are "ways of God to man."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_22:0.0000:Indeed, images which suggest that God actively participates
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_23:0.0000:in this world are finally so pervasive in Swift's ode that the world
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_24:0.0000:he describes seems, like More's universe, permeated with God. But,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_25:0.0000:often, even as these images suggest God's activity in the world, they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_26:0.0000:also suggest that this divine activity is somehow hidden. One of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_27:0.0000:most striking of such images occurs in the ode's fourth line. In
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0032_28:0.0250:that line Swift describes the "high sacred Seven" as being those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_9:0.0000:conception of the hidden God, the Deus Absconditus Whom even Moses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_12:0.0250:It is this very traditional conception of God, I think, which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_23:0.0500:And the idea of God, hidden away in a "vile manger," is hard to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_24:0.0500:answer with anything but "unbelieving scorn." It is, as Paul observed,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_25:0.0000:a folly to the Greeks and a stumbling block to the Jews. But to fail
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0033_26:0.0000:to accept it, as Swift's imagery of space and motion have shown us,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_0:0.0500:22
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_1:0.0500:Swift's Ode to Sancroft , then, is concerned with the most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_2:0.0500:basic of human questions^ what relationship is possible between man
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_3:0.0000:and God, how can man approach a hidden God? This question is made
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_4:0.0000:particularly difficult in this ode by Swift's constant reminders of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_5:0.0000:how limited, indeed, how untrustworthy, man's faculties really are.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_6:0.0000:Human reason, as we have already seen by the varieties of cosmolo-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_7:0.0000:gical confusion it can engender, is subject to all the errors of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_8:0.0000:pride. Human senses, too, Swift tells us in the second stanza, are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_9:0.0000:weak and distorting. But if man can trust neither his mind nor his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_10:0.0000:senses, then it seems that whirl alone is man's inheritance. Only
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_11:0.0000:Sancroft, in his "secret regular sphere," has succeeded in surmount-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_12:0.0250:ing that inheritance; and Sancroft, in his isolated retreat, seems
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_13:0.0000:both unapproachable and inexplicable.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_14:0.0000:Of Sancroft 's life, as we have already noted, and of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_16:0.0500:us very little. Further, we are seemingly told almost as little of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_22:0.0500:and further we know that he is "Free from our tyrant-passions, anger,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0034_23:0.0250:scorn and fear" (116). We know that because of his equanimity, his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_3:0.0250:intellect and will completely, but not all would willingly see
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_5:0.0250:Swift, however, in this ode, regularly connects virtue with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_6:0.0000:truth. Throughout the poem what truth man sees, or fails to see,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_7:0.0000:seems to depend upon his righteousness; knowledge is equated with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_8:0.0250:virtue, and ignorance with sin. We have already seen several
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_9:0.0000:instances of this. Ptolemy's cosmology was a false picture of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_10:0.0000:universe because, from Swift's point of view, it sprang from pride.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_11:0.0250:Much the same can be said of Descartes' cosmology.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_12:0.0500:So pervasive in this poem is Swift's insistence that man's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_13:0.0000:intellectual efforts must be conjoined with a will attuned to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_14:0.0000:virtuous actions that every instance which Swift presents of man's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_15:0.0000:confusion is but another example of man attempting to divorce the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_16:0.0000:goodness of one faculty from the goodness of the other. Thus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_17:0.0000:Descartes' cosmology, an attempted work of pure reason, undertaken
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_18:0.0000:in great pride, ends in confusion and contradiction. Thus those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_19:0.0250:religious reformers who, Swift complains, practice their reforming
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_20:0.0250:"arts" only to promote their own self-aggrandizement, end by kill-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_21:0.0250:ing the religion they promised to cure.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_22:0.0500:While this necessary conjunction of knowledge with virtue
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_23:0.0500:is not, as already pointed out, an equally acceptable premise for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0036_24:0.0250:all thinkers-, it is, to a greater or lesser degree, an earmark of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_0:0.0500:25
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_5:0.0250:impure, or weak, and unable in its cowardly blanching to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_6:0.0250:see the uttermost brightness, then it sees nothing even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_7:0.0000:though another point to what lies plain to sight before
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_8:0.0500:it. To any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_9:0.0000:is to be seen, and having some likeness to it. Never
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_10:0.0500:did eye see the sun unless it had first become sunlike,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_18:0.0250:It is presumably then, the import of Plotinus' passage in whatever
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_19:0.0250:version of it that Swift knew, which informs the imagery of light
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_20:0.0000:and dark that is so substantial a part of this poem. That is, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_21:0.0000:the Ode to Sancroft man's world is dark to him because he does not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_22:0.0000:acknowledge that before he can see his eye must be cleared. In the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_24:0.0250:tion, and does so through Miltonic echo.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_25:0.0000:One possible echo from Milton's third book of Paradise Lost
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_26:0.0000:has already been discussed above. Another has been noted by Joseph
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_27:0.0000:Horrell, who observed that the second line of Swift's ode, "Bright
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_28:0.0250:effluence of th' immortal ray," is apparently formed from the sixth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_29:0.0000:line of the invocation to light with which the third book of Para-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_30:0.0250:dise Lost begins. Milton's line runs, "Bright effluence of bright
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0037_31:0.0250:essence increate," and Swift not only borrows the image "bright
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_2:0.0500:the image "bright essence"--as a figure for truth — to form anotner:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_3:0.0000:"Since the bright essence fled, where haunts tne reverend ghost'.'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_4:0.0500:(43). Nor is this all. The first line of Swift's ode announces
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_5:0.0000:its subject with three heavily emphasized words, "Truth is Eternal,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_6:0.0000:and then connects that subject obliquely to Christ, "and the Son of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_7:0.0000:Heav'n." The line seems, then, a conscious imitation of tne first
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_8:0.0000:line of Milton's invocation, "Hail, holy light, offspring of Heaven
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_9:0.0000:first-born.'" These are not all the echoes of the invocation to light
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_10:0.0000:which occur in Swift's ode, but only a sufficient number to show us
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_11:0.0000:that the invocation was in Swift's mind as he composed his ode.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_13:0.0500:is Milton's confession of blindness and supplication for that illumi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_21:0.0500:But in Swift's ode, it is not only "inward" sight, sight which sees
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_22:0.0000:"things invisible," that requires an illuminated mind. The very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_23:0.0000:mechanics of "mortal sight," Swift reminds us, depend upon the eye
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_24:0.0000:being made receptive to that which it would see. The eye must "catch
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_25:0.0000:the living landscape in a scanty light" (30) Swift says, and his line
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_26:0.0000:is reminiscent, I think, of the first half of St. Paul's dictum, "Now
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_27:0.0000:we see as in a glass darkly, then we shall see as face to face,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_28:0.0250:while it directly refers (as John Nichols, the poem's first publisher
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0038_29:0.0500:pointed out) to "the experiment of the dark chamber, to demonstrate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_2:0.0000:the experiment to which Nichols alludes demonstrated was that the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_3:0.0000:eye in seeing does not shoot out shafts of light, but receives them.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_4:0.0250:Sight, then, as the experiment showed, is the result of both the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_5:0.0250:activity and passivity of the eye, the task of which is to actively
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_6:0.0000:make itself conformable to the essentially passive role of seeing.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_7:0.0500:And what Swift, then, might have gathered from the experiment is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_8:0.0250:that the role of the physical eye is, as Plotinus had intuitively
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_9:0.0500:known, a perfect analogue for the role a man must undertake would
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_10:0.0500:he approach God. As Plotinus puts it at the end of that passage
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_20:0.0000:Sancroft. But, rather than being over-inflated praise. Swift's com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_21:0.0000:parison is, I think, quite appropriate. For Swift's thought in this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_22:0.0250:poem, as we have already observed, often reflects both the cosmolo-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_23:0.0000:gical and ethical biases of Christian platonists; it is therefore
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_24:0.0000:appropriate that Swift's model for human conduct should be the norma-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_25:0.0000:tive model of Christian platonism--the godlike man. Recognizing the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_26:0.0000:kind of model Sancroft is, we are, I think, in a position to suggest
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0039_27:0.0500:the meaning of the portrait Swift draws.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_3:0.0250:godlike. But, on the other hand, if man must become godlike, ob-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_4:0.0000:viously an effort of human will is called for. But towards what is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_5:0.0500:that effort to be directed? Plato, in the Theaetetus may have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_10:0.0250:This is no mere tautology. It does not say thac to become
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_11:0.0250:godlike man must become godlike; rather it says that to become god-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_12:0.0000:like man must will to participate in godliness. The first step
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_13:0.0000:towards participating in the divine nature is to will to do so, and,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_14:0.0250:because it is the essence of divinity itself to choose righteousness
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_15:0.0000:and goodness, to choose God is also the last step in imitating him.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_16:0.0000:A certain learned doctor, one whose conception of the cosmos and of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_21:0.0500:the Purity of his Worship, That we have no will nor end of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_22:0.0250:our own. For as we are to have but one God, "Hear,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_23:0.0000:Israel, the Lord thy God is one God," so we are to have but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0040_24:0.0000:one Will, even the Will of the God Whom we worship. Which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_0:0.0500:29
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_18:0.0500:portrait of a godlike Sancroft, then, whose will is so completely
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_19:0.0000:attuned to God's that earthly "fortune in both extremes" is "but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_20:0.0000:one thing under two different names" is, when viewed against the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_21:0.0000:set of ideas which give it substance, both a model for human conduct
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_22:0.0000:and Swift's assertion that man is, in fact, formed after the image
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_23:0.0250:of God.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_24:0.0000:What then, finally, is Swift's view, in this ode, of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_25:0.0000:relationship between heaven and earth, man and God? The im.agery of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_26:0.0000:space and motion which was examined earlier in this chapter led us,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_27:0.0000:we remember, to something like Henry More's conception of the universe-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_28:0.0000:a conception in which God permeated, was hidden in, every particle of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_29:0.0000:matter. The portrait of Sancroft has also led us to something very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0041_30:0.0500:like More's conception of man, a conception in which man is imitatio
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_7:0.0500:Both recognize that although man is, in potentia , godlike, he must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_8:0.0250:willfully accept his birthright. After all, it was the failure of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_9:0.0250:a group of men to acknowledge God's providence in the civil acts of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_11:0.0250:Thus the position of both men is the more or less orthodox
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_12:0.0000:one that both this world and human nature are goods, but they are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_13:0.0000:goods dependent upon the God that created and sustains them and to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_14:0.0000:Whom they must ultimately return. That is why "apocalyptic
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_15:0.0250:mutterings," to use Maynard Mack's phrase, can be heard in several
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_16:0.0000:places in this ode--and most clearly in the following lines from the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_17:0.0000:seventh stanza. The lines describe the evanescent quality of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0042_18:0.0250:enthusiast's zeal, but they do so in imagery drawn from the second
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_2:0.0250:is done by no hands. This stone crushes first the feet and then the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_5:0.0250:Nebuchadnezzar, upon awakening, forgets the contents of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_6:0.0000:dream, but as he remains troubled by it, he calls upon first his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_7:0.0500:wise men and, seeing them fail, then upon Daniel to relate and ex-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_8:0.0250:plicate the dream. Daniel, having asserted that his knowledge
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_9:0.0500:originates not with himself but with God, explains to Nebuchadnezzar
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_10:0.0250:that he has dreamt a prophesy for the whole world. Four empires will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_11:0.0000:arise and then a fifth will be formed of the fragments of its pre-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_12:0.0250:decessors, but, at last, God will destroy all human kingdoms and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_13:0.0250:establish His ov7n Empire on earth.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_14:0.0000:The echo implies, I believe. Swift's final answer to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_15:0.0000:pride and folly, not only of the enthusiast's zeal, but of all the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_16:0.0000:men who are shown in this poem to have placed their will before
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_17:0.0250:God's. They shall perish, and their works shall pass away, but the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_18:0.0250:Kingdom of God will be established on earth. In fact, in a sense,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0043_20:0.0250:willing to participate in it to one another and to God.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_4:0.0000:According to the doctrine, the saints are able to entertain
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_5:0.0000:prayers addressed to them and to intercede, in heaven, for those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_6:0.0000:who have prayed because the Church on Earth is but a part of the one
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_7:0.0000:true Church, which encompasses also the Church in purgatory and the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_8:0.0000:Church in heaven. It is this total harmony and communion of God's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_9:0.0000:Kingdom which makes efficacious the appeal to the saints. But fur-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_10:0.0000:ther, according to Catholic doctrine, so far does this harmony extend
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_11:0.0000:that even men living in the world can, in emulating Christ, dedicate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_12:0.0000:their suffering to atone for the sin of other men. We have already
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_13:0.0000:noted that Sancroft, because he is a godly man, appears in this ode
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_14:0.0250:as a type of the Deus Absconditus ; what Swift's prayer to Sancroft
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_15:0.0250:allows us to appreciate is the real quality of Sancroft 's "influence."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_16:0.0000:Kathleen Williams remarked, we will remember, that the bishop's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_17:0.0000:"secret regular sphere" seemed overwhelmed by the calumny of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_18:0.0000:world Swift describes. But that is to miss the point, for, it is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_19:0.0250:finally out of his very misfortune that Sancroft can fashion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_23:0.0500:It is on the pervasiveness of God's spiritual kingdom that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_24:0.0250:this ode ends. Disregarding the "outcasts of this outcast age," its
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_25:0.0000:final line asserts that "Heaven and Cato both are pleas 'd." The line
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_26:0.0000:refers, presumably, to Cato the younger, whose life, in its devo-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_27:0.0000:tion to virtue and truth, in its isolation and in the contempt and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0044_28:0.0250:ridicule it elicited from his own contemporaries, bears a curious
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_1:0.0500:resemblance to Sancroft's own. Cato, had not, of course, the benefit
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_2:0.0500:of revelation, but. Swift maintains, Cato and heaven are in accord.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_3:0.0000:In accord, Swift has maintained, are heaven and all men whose will,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_4:0.0000:in devotion to virtue and truth, is not "self will" and whose ends
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_5:0.0000:are not "self ends" but who are "subordinate to the Will of God."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_6:0.0250:Brought together in one kingdom are the true men of all kingdoms and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0045_7:0.0500:all times, all within a Church which spans earth, purgatory and heaven.

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_12:0.0250:The poem opens ambitiously, presenting to us the Court of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_13:0.0000:Venus met in full session. The reason for this session is, however,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_14:0.0000:a professed decline of love between the sexes, and a multitude of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_15:0.0000:shepherds and nymphs are joined in debate to fix on each other the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_16:0.0000:responsibility for this decline. The pleader for the nymphs opens
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_17:0.0000:the debate by accusing both "that false creature, man," and Cupid him-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_18:0.0000:self of negligence in the pursuit of love. He cites as a sad result
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0048_19:0.0250:of this negligence, a universal decline of both romantic and conju-

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_1:0.0500:The pleader for the shepherds next states his case. He
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_2:0.0250:acknowledges that men have, indeed, grown indifferent to love but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_3:0.0000:he fixes the responsibility for this decline on the nymphs them-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_4:0.0250:selves. The nymphs, he maintains, have turned from that celestial
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_5:0.0250:flame, chaste and pure, which characterized ancient love and which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_6:0.0250:alone can inspire love in virtuous men. Their fancies, instead, are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_7:0.0000:engrossed by the lowest trivia, and the nymphs are therefore not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_8:0.0000:worthy of love from a worthy man.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_10:0.0250:clin'd" (128-129), finds her references to legal texts no help in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_11:0.0000:settling this dispute. Therefore, she undertakes an experiment
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_12:0.0500:which she hopes will at once restore her reign and settle the merits
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_13:0.0000:of the case before her. Choosing out a particularly beautiful female
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_14:0.0250:infant, she endows the child with all the graces at her command--out-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_15:0.0000:ward cleanliness, decency of mind, and a soft engaging air. Then,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_16:0.0250:in order to make the child completely worthy of a virtuous and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_17:0.0000:rational love, she deceives Pallas, goddess of wisdom, into believ-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_18:0.0000:ing the infant to be male. Thus deceived, Pallas grants the child
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_19:0.0250:those gifts of knowledge, judgment, wit, justice, truth, fortitude
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_20:0.0000:and honor which are traditionally the gifts of only the best of men.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_21:0.0250:Venus' task is thus complete and, she hopes, she has only to allow
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_22:0.0000:the cause before her to spin itself out for sixteen years until a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_23:0.0000:mature Vanessa can, by providing a model for nymphs and an object
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0049_24:0.0500:of adoration for shepherds, secure her reign.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_0:0.0500:38
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_10:0.0500:At this point Cupid, longing to vindicate his mother's wrongs,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_11:0.0000:succeeds in causing Vanessa to become enamoured of a fortyish priest,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_12:0.0000:her tutor, Cadenus, And now the poem becomes, in some sense, bio-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_13:0.0000:graphical, the reflection of an actual relationship between Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_14:0.0000:himself and Esther Vanhomerigh. Vanessa, smitten, betrays all the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_15:0.0250:classic marks of love-sickness--she feels pain at heart, listens to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_16:0.0250:her tutor's voice but not his lectures, and contrives ways in which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_17:0.0000:to touch his hand. Cadenus, misunderstanding, concludes she has
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_18:0.0000:grown tired of his lectures; he therefore offers to withdraw, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_19:0.0000:thereby actually forces Vanessa to confess her love. Her confession
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_20:0.0000:precipitates a debate between them in which Vanessa attempts to main-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_21:0.0000:tain the reasonableness of her love while Cadenus offers only the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_22:0.0250:unsatisfactory (to her) return of "Friendship in its greatest
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0050_23:0.0500:height." (780).
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_9:0.0500:The lavish number of lines, nearly nine hundred, expended
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_10:0.0000:to arrive at so halting a conclusion would be surprising even from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_11:0.0000:an author whose power of economy was less proverbial than Swift's.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_12:0.0250:Swift, however, in Cadenus and Vanessa , seems unable even to tell
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_13:0.0000:his story without numerous inconsistencies. Thus, for example, we
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_14:0.0000:are first told that Cupid, hoping to procure a lover for Vanessa,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_15:0.0250:shot numerous arrows "Pointed at Col'nels, Lords, and Beaux" (478).
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_16:0.0000:Then we are told that Cadenus warded off these same arrows by placing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_17:0.0000:books in the hands of (presumably) Vanessa. What Swift is getting
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_18:0.0250:at is clear enough; Cupid's efforts are in vain because Vanessa,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_19:0.0000:tutored by Cadenus, is both learned and aloof. But the path of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_20:0.0000:Swift's metaphorical arrows is impossible to trace.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_21:0.0500:Worse still than such missteps, however, is the poem's gene-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_22:0.0000:ral inconclusiveness, the air of indecision which hangs over the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_23:0.0000:entire production. First, the debate between the shepherds and nymphs
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_24:0.0000:which opens the poem is never, by the parties themselves, brought
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_25:0.0000:to issue. Second, the debate between Cadenus and Vanessa not only
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_26:0.0250:is not concluded, it does not seem possible to conclude it since
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0051_27:0.0500:the argument springs from fundamentally unarguable circumstances:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_2:0.0250:is finally rendered by Venus against the men, that judgment is not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_3:0.0250:very convincing, since, although it is true that the shepherds
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_4:0.0500:have failed to adore Vanessa, it is equally true that the nymphs
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_5:0.0000:have failed to model themselves after her. Therefore, despite
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_6:0.0000:Venus' judgment, the end of the poem finds all things as they were
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_7:0.0250:at its beginning, at a state of "six and seven."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_8:0.0500:To seek, then, in Cadenus and Vanessa for a consistent and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_9:0.0000:unified view of human love is to search for what, I suspect, does
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_10:0.0000:not exist in the poem. But that is not to say that Cadenus and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_11:0.0000:Vanessa does not repay close study. On the contrary, the poem
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_12:0.0000:provides, first I think, as much insight as we shall ever have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_13:0.0000:into what a more romantic age called "the mystery of Swift's life
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_14:0.0000:and loves." And secondly, while the poem is hardly an "art of love^"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_15:0.0000:it is, I think, taken as a whole, a single large metaphor for "the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_16:0.0000:difficulties which love attend." The poem has never been read this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_17:0.0000:way, but reading it so shows, I think, its apparent missteps and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_18:0.0250:its hopelessly futile debates as, not flaws, but as coherent parts
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_19:0.0500:of Swift's precise illustration of love's difficulties.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_22:0.0000:apparently proceeds to no conclusion, it has proven a treasure trove
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_23:0.0250:of sorts for generations of critics seeking to document one or
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_24:0.0000:another attitude towards Swift or about his work. Most of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_25:0.0000:speeches which in the poem are assigned to Venus, Pallas, Vanessa
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0052_26:0.0500:and Cadenus have been, at some time, taken to represent Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0053_16:0.0000:regarded the fact that the speech is only a recapitulation by the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0053_17:0.0250:character, Vanessa, of an opinion supposedly held by the character
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0053_18:0.0500:Cadenus . Instead, Orrery used this speech to draw a very black
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_7:0.0250:What is surprising, though, is not that this highly subjec-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_8:0.0000:tive and personal form of criticism should have been written by men
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_9:0.0250:who knew Swift well, but that it should still remain, as we shall
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_10:0.0000:see, the dominant strain in modern criticism of Cadenus and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_11:0.0500:Vanessa . The antidote for it, after all, has existed for over two
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_12:0.0000:hundred years. For Swift's nephew, Deane Swift, while animadverting
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_13:0.0000:upon Orrery's Remarks a year after Delany, added to Delany 's read-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_14:0.0250:ing of Cadenus and Vanessa the necessary fillip of critical insight.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_15:0.0250:To Orrery's assumption that Cadenus and Vanessa are the exact
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_16:0.0250:counterparts to Swift and Esther Vanhomerigh, Deane Swift replied
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_17:0.0000:that, for all we know, the poem might be purely a work of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_18:0.0250:imagination; and further, that even if we assume that Swift and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_19:0.0000:Esther are, in some sense, Cadenus and Vanessa, the degree to which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_20:0.0000:the poet's imagination has transformed them must remain hidden from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_21:0.0000:us. A clearsighted application, then, of Deane Swift's insight to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_22:0.0000:Cadenus and Vanessa should produce a reading of the poem which can
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_23:0.0000:be validated from the text and has nothing to do with either a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_24:0.0250:critic's sympathy towards or dislike of' Jonathan Swift himself.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_25:0.0000:But nothing can more clearly illustrate the difficulty of producing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_26:0.0500:such a reading than a review of ' the most intensive and cogent of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0054_27:0.0000:modern attempts on the poem.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_2:0.0000:tance between the poem and the relationship between Swift and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_3:0.0250:Esther Vonhomerigh which inspired it. Rather than turning towards
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_4:0.0250:what we know of that relationship in order to understand the poem,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_5:0.0250:Ohlin suggests we draw "some aid from other and less immediately
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_6:0.0500:personal documents from Swift's hand." These sources, Ohlin
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_7:0.0000:argues, "will reveal that Cadenus and Vanessa is a delicately exe-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_8:0.0000:cuted dialogue between reason and passion, utilizing the conflict
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_9:0.0250:between these two principles as the controlling device."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_10:0.0250:The less immediately personal documents Ohlin uses are,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_11:0.0250:principally, A Letter to a Young Lady on her Marriage , Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_12:0.0000:poems to Stella and Thoughts on Various Sub-jects . From these Ohlin
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_13:0.0000:draws documentation for what he calls Swift's "orthodox christian"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_14:0.0000:view of love, a view which, though it does not find sexual passion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_15:0.0000:evil, insists that this passion must be constantly directed by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_16:0.0250:reason. This view of Swift's "orthodox Christianity" forms the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_17:0.0500:background for Ohlin 's reading of the poem.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_18:0.0500:The "two principles" of "reason" and "passion" are re-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_19:0.0500:presented, according to Ohlin, by two characters apiece. "Passion's'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_20:0.0000:prime representative is, of course, Venus, whom Ohlin characterizes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_21:0.0250:as "vain, sensuous and deceitful." Fearful of the loss of her em-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_22:0.0000:pire (and therefore vain)^ Venus deceives Pallas (whom Ohlin con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_23:0.0000:siders "reason's" first representative) into helping her create
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_24:0.0000:Vanessa. Vanessa, until her intellect is addled by the force of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_25:0.0000:Cupid's dart is, Ohlin argues, reasonable because she is a perfect
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_26:0.0250:blend of reason and passion. When, however, she has once been
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0055_28:0.0500:reason and her mind is darkened by vain imaginings. Gazing at
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0056_0:0.0500:44
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_10:0.0250:Despite the apparent obviousness of the point, however, Ohlin is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_11:0.0000:the first critic to notice it, and thus he frees himself, and us,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_12:0.0250:of the need--which Delany and many another critic since has felt--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_13:0.0000:to read Vanessa's lines as if they expressed Swift's own considered
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_14:0.0000:opinions. Vanessa's lines can therefore be read, not with an eye
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_15:0.0000:towards making them consistent with what we think is (or ought to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_16:0.0000:be) Swift's opinion, but by the portrait Swift provides us of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_17:0.0000:character who speaks them.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_18:0.0000:But if Ohlin 's strongest point is his treatment of Vanessa,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_19:0.0000:his weakest point is his treatment of Cadenus. For although Ohlin
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_20:0.0000:treats Cadenus as the moral center of the poem and as Swift's own
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_21:0.0000:spokesman. Swift has, I think, compromised Cadenus quite as much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_22:0.0250:as he has Vanessa. The speech, for example, in which Cadenus offers
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_23:0.0000:Vanessa that "gratitude, respect, and esteem," which Ohlin claims
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0057_24:0.0250:to be "christian selfless love," Swift, in fact, introduced with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_2:0.0500:both Cadenus' character and of Cadenus ' lines.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_3:0.0500:Indeed, because Ohlin takes Cadenus' point of view for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_4:0.0250:Swift's own, he misses much of the complexity of Cadenus and Vanessa .
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_5:0.0000:He is forced to read the whole of Cadenus and Vanessa from what he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_6:0.0250:conceives to be Cadenus' preference for reason over passion, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_7:0.0000:he must, therefore, rigorously pare the poem down to the scope of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_8:0.0000:Cadenus' vision. Ironically, the poem takes its revenge by in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_9:0.0000:volving Ohlin in contradiction. Thus, for example, Ohlin begins by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_10:0.0000:describing Venus as Cadenus doubtless would have seen her--vain,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_11:0.0250:shamelessly sensuous, and deceitful. But by the end of his article
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_12:0.0250:Ohlin is forced to admit that it is, indeed, "to the World's per-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_13:0.0250:petual Shame/ [that] The Queen of Beauty lost her aim," (432-33)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_14:0.0250:The moral of all this is, of course, only an extension of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_15:0.0000:the point Deane Swift made over two hundred years ago--that neither
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_16:0.0000:Cadenus nor Vanessa nor any other of the poem's characters can
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_17:0.0000:be taken for Swift's own authentic voice. But, on the other hand,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_18:0.0000:we ought not dismiss too quickly a critical error which has per-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_19:0.0000:sisted for over two hundred years; for the error, I think, con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_20:0.0000:tains a germ of truth. For, although Orrery was certainly wrong
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_21:0.0000:in attacking Swift through the lines of a character whose argu-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_22:0.0000:ments Swift himself has amply enough undermined, nevertheless, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_23:0.0250:opinions which Vanessa espouses can, as we shall see, be found in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_24:0.0000:Swift's writings when he was speaking in his own person. Similarly,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_25:0.0000:although Ohlin erred in drawing too tightly together Swift and the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_26:0.0250:character whose flaws Swift clearly exposes, Ohlin has certainly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_27:0.0500:demonstrated that Swift, at times, did offer arguments very much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0058_28:0.0250:like those he provides Cadenus. Indeed, the complexity of the poem
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_2:0.0250:of the characters in his poem, nevertheless, all of them argue in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_3:0.0250:ways which he has argued. It is small wonder, then, that critics
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_4:0.0250:have so often seen, and felt forced to judge, Swift within his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_5:0.0250:lines; for Cadenus and Vanessa is almost a psychomachia. Almost,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_6:0.0000:I say, but not quite: for it is the nature of a psychomachia to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_7:0.0250:move towards a conclusion in which virtue which is clearly virtue
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_8:0.0000:triumphs over vice which is clearly vice. But Cadenus and Vanessa
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_9:0.0000:reaches no conclusion; rather, as I hope to show, it exposes and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_10:0.0000:judges the contrary opinions on love held by the Dean of St. Patricks
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_11:0.0250:Cathedral. It is, to repeat myself, a single large mataphor for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_12:0.0000:"the difficulties which love attends."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_15:0.0250:ship between Swift and Esther Vonhomerigh seems peculiarly tailored
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_16:0.0000:to illuminate, for Swift, love's difficulties. Yet, for all that,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_17:0.0000:the relationship began normally enough. Swift first met Esther in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_18:0.0000:1708 and was doubtless taken by her combination of youth (she was not,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_19:0.0000:however, so young as Swift thought), good looks, good character and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_20:0.0000:good sense. Further, to all these qualities Esther apparently added
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_21:0.0250:two more which Swift found certainly not charming but, nevertheless,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_22:0.0000:compelling: these were a streak of laziness and, subsequently, a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_23:0.0000:lady-like ignorance. These qualities were, for Swift, probably com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_24:0.0000:pelling, since, as is well enough known. Swift's penchant for reform-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0059_25:0.0500:ing female manners amounted to something very like a life-long avoca-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_4:0.0000:How long this relatively simple friendship continued and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_5:0.0000:when, and in what way, it deepened into both something more and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_6:0.0000:something different it is not possible to say. If we could fix a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_7:0.0000:date for the completion of Cadenus and Vanessa , we should know, at
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_8:0.0000:least, the latest date by which Esther had declared her love to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_9:0.0000:Swift; but the date by which Swift completed that poem is as uncer-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_10:0.0000:tain as anything else in the history of Swift and Esther. What
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_11:0.0250:we do know is that by 1711 Swift felt it necessary to suppress, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_12:0.0250:his correspondence to Esther Johnson, his previously numerous refer-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_13:0.0000:ences to the Vonhomerigh establishment in general and Vanessa in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_14:0.0000:particular. And we know too, that about this same time Swift and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_19:0.0250:complicated. Swift was deeply involved, and Vanessa, presumably, had
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_20:0.0000:conceived what she was later to call her "inexpressible passion" for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_21:0.0000:Swift. Because Cadenus and Vanessa is, in some way. Swift's response
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_22:0.0250:to Esther's passion for him, it is worthwhile to see what her cor-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_23:0.0500:respondence tells us of her and her passion.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_24:0.0500:A surprising amount has been written about Esther, and most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_25:0.0000:of it portrays her as a poor, weak-willed girl overpowered by both
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_26:0.0000:Swift and her own sentiments. This portrait is not confirmed, how-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_27:0.0000:ever, by either the quality of style or argumentation which one finds
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0060_28:0.0000:in her correspondence with Swift. To be sure, Esther could, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_4:0.0250:cannot banish those charming ideas, which will ever
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_5:0.0250:stick by me whilst I have the use of memory. Nor is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_6:0.0000:the love I bear you only seated in my soul, for there
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_7:0.0500:is not an atom of my frame that is not blended with it.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_8:0.0000:Therefore don't flatter yourself that separation will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_13:0.0000:as for a warm heart, and particularly the carefully constructed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_15:0.0000:the use of the blunt as well as the sharp end of her stylus. Further,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_16:0.0000:passionate as she was, Esther could, on occasion, invert the whole
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_17:0.0000:form of passionate address by the delicate application of satire--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_18:0.0500:and she could perform such mischief almost as well as Swift himself,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_22:0.0000:to reclaim you, and if all those fail I am resolved to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_23:0.0250:have recourse to the black one, which, it is said, never
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_24:0.0000:does. Now see what inconveniences you will bring both me
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_25:0.0000:and yourself into. Pray think calmly of it. Is it not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_31:0.0250:If, however, the style of Esther's letters is consistently
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_32:0.0000:good--and Swift thought it was--her mode of argumentation is often
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_33:0.0000:positively striking. For Esther's arguments are founded on ele-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0061_34:0.0250:ments of Swift's own principles and use those principles in such
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_0:0.0500:50
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_1:0.0500:The aim of all her letters is, of course, to draw Swift closer to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_2:0.0000:her, and her whole means for accomplishing this aim is her attractive-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_3:0.0000:ness to him. Her task, then, was to place Swift's emotional and sub-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_4:0.0250:jective responses to her, his pity, friendship, admiration and love,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_5:0.0000:within a frame of reference which would weigh those responses most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_6:0.0000:heavily. Her art, practiced over a period of nearly a dozen years,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_7:0.0000:consisted in the skill with which she culled, from Swift's own thought,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_8:0.0250:those elements which honor subjective and individualistic response.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_9:0.0500:Such elements really exist in Swift's thought, but because
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_10:0.0000:critics have found more striking Swift's alternative view--his rigorous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_11:0.0000:demand for objective judgment--the subjective nature of many of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_12:0.0000:maxims and much of his advice has often been overlooked. Thus, for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_13:0.0000:example, the extreme objectivism of Swift's following advice to Stella
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0062_23:0.0500:that a subjective point of view is sometimes not only more chari-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_7:0.0000:I will add one Thing, although it be a little out of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_8:0.0000:Place, which is to desire that you will learn to value
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_9:0.0250:and esteem your Husband, for those good Qualities which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_10:0.0500:he really possesseth; and not to fancy others in him,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_11:0.0000:which he certainly hath not. For, although this latter
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_22:0.0500:What I think is clear from these "matched sets" of examples--and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_23:0.0000:they might easily be multiplied--is that though Swift honored the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_24:0.0000:man who saw clearly and objectively, he also recognized the validity
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_25:0.0000:of certain kinds of subjective truths. He knew, that is, that beauty
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_26:0.0250:and, perhaps, truth is often in the eye of the beholder.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_27:0.0500:Indeed, even aspects of Swift's thought which do not im-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_28:0.0500:mediately appear subjective can often bear very subjective applica-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_30:0.0500:"Act what is right and do not mind what the world says," might
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0063_31:0.0500:itself be dangerously subjective, since it can make not only the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_2:0.0000:determination of values a matter of individual interpretation.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_3:0.0500:But Orrery perceived this possible application of Swift's maxim
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_4:0.0250:much later than Esther, to whom Swift had taught it. "You had
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_5:0.0000:once a maxim, "Esther remarked to Swift when she would encourage '
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_6:0.0250:his attention and diminish his reticence, "to do what was right and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_7:0.0250:not mind what the world said. I wish you would stick to it now."^^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_8:0.0500:It was, of course, Esther's misfortune to be unsuccessful,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_9:0.0500:and Swift proved reticent for a host of reasons, some of which we
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_10:0.0000:know, some, probably, not. Yet there can be, I tnink, no doubt
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_11:0.0000:that Swift loved her: indeed, he was even willing, on occasion, to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_12:0.0500:spin out love's logic for her; to evaluate her by the only standard
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_13:0.0250:she wished to be judged by, the subjective truth of his affection
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_14:0.0500:for her. "What beasts in pettycoats," he tells her in a famous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_21:0.0500:Presumably, when Swift wrote this passage, and others like it, he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_22:0.0250:felt he was telling the truth. But he knew, too, that he was tell-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_23:0.0000:ing only one kind of truth, and a very special kind at that. And
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_24:0.0000:he knew that a coldly objective view of his relationship with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_25:0.0000:Esther must include the disparity of their ages, stations and tempera-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_26:0.0250:ments, just as coldly objective view of Vanessa herself must include
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0064_27:0.0000:her impatient, splenetic temperament and her often total lack of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_0:0.0500:53
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_1:0.0500:Celling a young woman to "do what was right and not mind what the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_2:0.0500:world said," and then to berate her with, "You once bragged you
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_3:0.0250:were very discrete. Where is it gone?" But that is exactly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_4:0.0000:Swift's dilemma. On the one hand he found, and recorded, his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_5:0.0000:responsiveness to Esther; on the other hand he could not keep from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_6:0.0000:seeing, and recording, an exact state of her qualities. Because the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_7:0.0500:two accounts did not correspond, Swift's letters to Esther vary,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_8:0.0000:as has long been recognized, from warm affection and abundant
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_9:0.0500:praise to something very like disdain and stern reprimand. Esther,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_10:0.0000:of course, had no such double account and was, therefore, the much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_11:0.0000:more perfect lover. Indeed, Esther seems in all her humors to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_13:0.0500:which she passionately wished to be judged.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_25:0.0500:But though Esther's love for Swift is so perfect as to remind us
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_26:0.0250:(and Esther, Coo, perhaps) of Heloise's love for Abalard, never-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_27:0.0000:theless. Swift, with his heats and chills, his double accounts, his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_28:0.0000:affections and reticence, seems the more human. That is why
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0065_29:0.0500:Cadenus and Vanessa , in its painfully amusing account of the in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_0:0.0500:54
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_1:0.0250:IV
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_11:0.0000:attack. "Free thinkers," as the advocate goes on to charge, had
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_12:0.0000:indeed been at work on the principles of love's religion, with the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_13:0.0250:result that, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_14:0.0250:prominent fact about Venus' kingdom, with its religion, laws, courts
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_15:0.0250:and mythology, is that it no longer could provide a possible meta-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_16:0.0000:phor for the reality of human love. That is why, to stress the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_17:0.0250:obvious, we are amused by the high flying legalese which character-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0066_18:0.0250:izes the opening speech of the nymphs' advocate. It is not the com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_12:0.0250:Venus. A glance at the sixteenth century composition, The
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_21:0.0250:first fully recorded in the lyric verse of the Stuart poets,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_22:0.0250:operated to dissolve any possible connection between law and love.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_23:0.0000:For the Stuart poets are the first to fully affirm that the phenome-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_24:0.0250:non of love has absolutely nothing to do with external reality but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_25:0.0000:rather is a function of only internal reality, of the highly sub-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0067_26:0.0250:jective needs of the lover himself. "Why slightest thou," asks
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_3:0.0250:Of course, this sort of observation was not unheard of be-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_4:0.0250:fore the seventeenth century. Presumably, so long as men have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_5:0.0250:loved at all they have noticed that sexual love does not often
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_6:0.0500:smoothly follow the path of rational choice. Thus, for example,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_7:0.0500:Horace notes that Barine's patent unfaithfulness does not diminish
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_8:0.0500:her attractiveness either for himself or for any man who desires
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_18:0.0250:ality of love and desire, but he does not like it. He would much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_19:0.0250:rather that he might love the she whom he should, or better still,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_20:0.0250:that the she whom he loved would be as she ought. And it is this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_21:0.0250:perfectly human desire for a rational love, a love founded on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_22:0.0250:tested merit, which is given metaphoric form, in so many medieval
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_23:0.0500:and renaissance poems, by the proofs, trials, laws, rules, in short,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_24:0.0250:by the whole framework of Venus' courts and kingdom.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0068_27:0.0250:the seventeenth century, came increasingly to be questioned. "Tell
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_5:0.0000:of restoration lyricism can be confirmed by an examination of almost
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_22:0.0250:7^2
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_23:0.0250:And here, I think, Suckling sets for us, though in brutal terms, that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_24:0.0000:dilemma which, as we shall see, is also the central problem in Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_25:0.0000:Cadenus and Vanessa . Our answer to the question posed by the final
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_26:0.0000:line of Suckling's poem, "Judge whether I am happy, yea or no?" must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_27:0.0000:be "yea": the narrator of this poem has, after all, the woman he wants
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_28:0.0000:(his "utmost wish") and therefore must be happy. Yet, even as we say
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_29:0.0000:that the narrator is a happy man we cannot, I suspect, help thinking
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_30:0.0000:that since the woman the narrator has is a perfect horror when judged
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_31:0.0000:by any standard but his own, he ought not be happy. That is, we finally
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0069_32:0.0000:don't want to think that love is so subjective, so arbitrary, that a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_15:0.0500:But Swift is no Suckling. Suckling, as we have seen above, cooly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_16:0.0000:forces us to see that, though we wish love were rational and objec-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_17:0.0000:tive, it is arbitrary, standardless and subjective. And having made
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_18:0.0000:his point. Suckling leaves us with the discomforting dilemma that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_19:0.0000:love's arbitrariness raises in our own minds. Swift, on the other
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_20:0.0000:hand, incorporating this same dilemma within Cadenus and Vanessa ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_21:0.0000:does not so much offer us a dilemma as struggle with one himself, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_22:0.0000:it is Swift's own struggles which give an order and coherence to a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_23:0.0000:story which is otherwise, as Goldsmith remarked, apparently, "ill con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_24:0.0000:ceived in itself."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_25:0.0500:Thus, although the debate between the shepherds and nymphs
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_27:0.0000:Rather, it is an excellent demonstration that love is not susceptible
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_28:0.0250:to rules, laws, and legal arbitration. Or again, although the debate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0070_29:0.0250:between Cadenus and Vanessa ends at stalemate, that is itself Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_2:0.0250:pletely unamenable to arbitration. What makes these demonstra-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_3:0.0000:tions so terribly convincing is precisely that they stem from fail-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_4:0.0000:ures. The narrative of the poem itself, that is, struggles to af-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_5:0.0000:fect a reconciliation between love and wisdom^ and we cannot there-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_6:0.0250:fore help but feel Swift's sympathies are engaged on behalf of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_7:0.0250:reconciliation. That it is not, therefore, effected, must impress
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_8:0.0000:us far more deeply with love's subjective nature than does even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_9:0.0000:Suckling's poem The Deformed Mistress , examined briefly above. For
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_10:0.0000:we cannot forget, I think, that Swift's desire to effect this recon-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_11:0.0000:ciliation, and his failure to do so, have a deeply personal aspect.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_12:0.0250:Finally, that is, Cadenus and Vanessa is Swift's very honest, yet
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_13:0.0000:most tactful explanation to Esther Vonhomerigh that he fails to wholly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_14:0.0000:love her as she wished him to love her not because he does not de-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_15:0.0000:sire to do so, and not because she is unworthy of him, but because,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_17:0.0000:nature of love, he cannot help.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_20:0.0000:and, on the other hand, the highly idealistic, self-deceiving and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_21:0.0250:psychologically naive assumption that love ought follow absolute
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0071_23:0.0000:nymphs' accusations.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_13:0.0000:lofty requirements on the nature of love, imagine a passion which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_14:0.0000:has no existence. Therefore, their advocates' description of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_15:0.0000:passion, as one which infallibly reduces its devotees to ashes, is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_16:0.0250:both apt and laughable. Such passion, as the shepherds' advocate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_17:0.0000:goes on to tell us, is nowhere discoverable in the world but was
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_18:0.0000:once sung by ancient poets. And this description makes it a near
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_19:0.0000:relative, I suspect, of what Swift, in his own person called, "that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_20:0.0000:ridiculous passion which hath no being but in Play-books and romances,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_21:0.0250:and which he prudently advised a recently married young woman against
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_22:0.0000:believing in.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_24:0.0250:cally naive view of love presented in the shepherds' complaint, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_25:0.0000:entire complaint is not made ridiculous. Rather, that part of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_26:0.0000:complaint which is directed against the nymphs has a very convincing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_27:0.0000:ring since the frivolities which the shepherds accuse the nymphs of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_28:0.0250:following to the exclusion of everything else are exactly those for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0072_29:0.0250:which Swift, in his own person, often berated that "tribe of bold.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_0:0.0500:61
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_18:0.0250:^\Tiat emerges, then, even in the opening speeches of Cadenus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_19:0.0000:and Vanessa , is Swift's attempt to honor two standards of love. On
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_20:0.0000:the one hand Swift, in good restoration fashion, is parodying Venus'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_21:0.0000:Court and the high-handed methods with which both advocates apply
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_22:0.0000:rules to love. On the other hand. Swift is in sympathy with the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_23:0.0000:shepherds' plea that love ought to respond only to an actual good
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_24:0.0000:and that, therefore, vjomen ought to be truly worthy of the love of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_25:0.0000:a good man. Indeed, Venus' experiment is nothing other than an at-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_26:0.0000:tempt to adjust these two standards to each other. For Venus, by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_27:0.0000:endowing Vanessa with the perfection of every virtue, creates a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_28:0.0000:woman whom, she hopes, all men needs must love, but whom it will be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_29:0.0250:perfectly reasonable to love.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_0:0.0500:62
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_2:0.0000:as Venus sadly complains, Vanessa, "Never could one lover find."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_3:0.0000:(867). And the moral of this is obvious: no matter what the shep-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_4:0.0000:herds claim, no matter how much men wish to love reasonably, sexual
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_5:0.0000:love is not reasonable. Rather, love has nothing to do with the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_6:0.0000:true value of the one loved and everything to do wiih the values of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_7:0.0000:the lover. And, in fact, this outcome has been predictable from the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_8:0.0000:beginning of the poem, for, from the beginning of the poem, Venus and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_9:0.0000:Pallas are professed foes and no possible reconciliation is ever of-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_10:0.0500:fered between these goddesses of love and of wisdom.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_11:0.0500:But if this outcome is obvious, we must not therefore miss
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_12:0.0000:its pathos in Cadenus and Vanessa . R£.ised on lyrics like, "I don't
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_13:0.0000:know why I love you like I do, I don't know why, I just do," and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_14:0.0250:assuming naturally that love is subjective, it is possible, I suspect,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_15:0.0000:for us to miss Swift's implied regret in lines like, "thus, to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_16:0.0000:world's eternal shame,/ The Queen of Beauty lost her aim" (431-432).
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_17:0.0000:But for us not to credit the regret in these lines would be a mis-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_18:0.0000:take, I think; for our understanding of the poem depends upon our
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_19:0.0000:recognizing that Swift's sympathies are clearly engaged by Venus and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_20:0.0250:her experiment. For although only by deceit is Venus able to enlist
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_21:0.0000:Wisdom's aid towards endowing Vanessa and although Pallas proves to be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0074_22:0.0500:perfectly right in asking her scornfully rhetorical question,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_0:0.0500:63
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_3:0.0250:(435-436)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_4:0.0000:And indeed, in the defeat of Venus' experiment are involved
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_5:0.0000:a goodly number of cherished assumptions. Thus, for example, while
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_6:0.0000:it is true that Swift, by couching in trivial terms Venus' naive
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_7:0.0000:assumption that Vanessa's virtue must inspire universal love and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_8:0.0250:imitation, made that assumption appear just as naive as it is;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_9:0.0500:nevertheless, for all its simple-mindedness, there is something
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_19:0.0250:it is assumed to be in so many romances both past and present--an
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_20:0.0500:instrument capable of reforming men's manners and morals. Those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_21:0.0500:degraded shepherds and nymphs whom Venus hoped to reform through
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_2:0.0500:is dependent solely on the nature of the lover. "Great examples,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_4:0.0250:(436-437). But, because Swift has put Venus' expectations in such a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_5:0.0250:homely and appealing strain, there is something distinctly disappoint-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_6:0.0000:ing in discovering that Venus has, as Pallas prophesied to her, de-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_7:0.0500:ceived herself, instead of Pallas. Pallas, is perfectly right, of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_8:0.0250:course, and as she goes on to claim, "love" and "sense" have never
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_9:0.0250:had anything to do with one another; but there is, nevertheless, a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_10:0.0250:pathos in that truth which Pallas seems incapable of appreciating buc
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_11:0.0250:which Swift, I think, has made perfectly plain.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_12:0.0500:The source of this pathos, is, of course, most fully explored
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_13:0.0000:in the relationship of Vanessa and Cadenus, To be sure, everywhere
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_14:0.0000:in the narration of their relationship love's subjectivity and funda-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_15:0.0250:mental irrationality are insisted on„ Vanessa, for example, falls in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_16:0.0250:love not because of the reasonable appreciation which she might have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_17:0.0500:for Cadenus' gifts but rather through the violent and distressing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_18:0.0000:efforts of Cupid. And once she is in love, Vanessa's reason is pal-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_19:0.0250:pably affected, for, as we have already noted above, she comes badly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_20:0.0500:to overestimate Cadenus' gifts while unmistakably blurring his failings,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_7:0.0500:Yet, Vanessa's attempts to reconcile her love for Cadenus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_9:0.0250:virtues which Cadenus taught and she, by the dictates of reason,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_10:0.0250:accepted, have now become her character, she, in loving herself,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_11:0.0000:must infallibly love him. Reason is thus, she may conclude, "her
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_12:0.0000:guide in love." Vanessa's arguments are as ingenious as they are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_13:0.0000:attractive, and certainly we must admit about them what even Cadenus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_14:0.0000:admits, that we "at least could hardly wish them wrong." And yet
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_15:0.0000:they are wrong, and Vanessa herself indicates the point at which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_16:0.0000:they err. For, seeking to turn everything to her argument, Vanessa
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_17:0.0500:compares her love for Cadenus to his reverence for the authors of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_22:0.0500:But not even Vanessa can completely equate her passion for Cadenus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_23:0.0250:to his for ancient authors. A scholar's feelings for such authors
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_24:0.0250:vjere, she knew, esteem, respect, devotion, and that sort of love
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_25:0.0500:which she rightly characterizes in remarking that were such an author
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_26:0.0000:now alive, "How all would for his friendship strive." (701)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_16:0.0000:Yet it is Vanessa, I think, rather than Cadenus, whom Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_17:0.0000:has created to most engage our sympathies. True, Vanessa was able
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_18:0.0000:no more than Venus to reconcile love and reason, and Vanessa, in her
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_19:0.0250:subjective and passionate commitment to Cadenus shows herself willing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_20:0.0000:to badly distort logic, and indeed, "all nature" in order to effect
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_21:0.0000:her ends. Yet, if the basis of Vanessa's love is irrational self-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_22:0.0000:love, it is self-love more generously employed, one feels, than that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_23:0.0000:love of self which guides Cadenus' actions. For both Cadenus' fear
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_24:0.0000:of gossip, "of what the world will say," and his susceptibility to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_25:0.0000:flattery are aspects of his own most unhappy variant of self-love--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_26:0.0000:pride. And as Vanessa has mistaken reason as her "guide in love" so
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_27:0.0000:Cadenus subverts reason to be his guide in pride, and the result is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_8:0.0000:But neither must x-ie judge Cadenus more harshly than does the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_10:0.0250:to cover his own self-interest is somehow always awry. Thus he,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_11:0.0000:having offered to a woman whom he does not love what he claims is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_12:0.0000:a higher good, "friendship. . .a constant rational delight," con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_13:0.0500:tinues on, with splendid inconsistency to offer her.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_18:0.0250:Vanessa does not want, there is something touching and generously
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_19:0.0000:redeeming in it. For finally, Cadenus is really not much different
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_20:0.0000:from anyone else in the cast of this poem: all the cast are engaged
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_21:0.0000:in the same funny, pitiable and human attempt to make truth submit
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_22:0.0250:to their own subjective needs and views. The shepherds and nymphs,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_23:0.0000:reasonably blaming each other while holding themselves utterly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_24:0.0000:blameless; Venus, by reason, defending her kingdom; Pallas, un-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_25:0.0000:charitably but by reason defending hers; Vanessa reasonably defend-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_26:0.0000:ing her love and Cadenus reasonably defending his failure to love:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_27:0.0250:each is a miniature proof that man is, at best, but dimly conscious
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0079_28:0.0250:of, and capable of controlling, his own nature. And yet they all.

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0081_30:0.0250:69
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_3:0.0500:None of Swift's poems has been so consistently praised as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_4:0.0250:has On Poetry: A Rapsody . Certain sections, at least, of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_5:0.0250:poem have been abundantly anthologized, and the poem has teen tra-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_6:0.0000:ditionally characterized as "one of Swift's chief claims to che
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_7:0.0000:title of poet." Indeed, one passage from the poem has been so
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_8:0.0000:often cited as to have transcended both Swift and his Rapsody ; the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_9:0.0000:passage. Swift's famous comparison of fleas and poets, has achieved
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_10:0.0500:through frequent quotation an independent state of famous anonymity
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_22:0.0000:popular since the time of Goldsmith's praise of it as "one of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_23:0.0000:best versified poems in our language and the most masterly pro-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_24:0.0250:duction of its author," it has not, to the best of my knowledge,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_25:0.0250:ever been made the subject of much close study. Rather, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0083_26:0.0500:observations which critics have usually flung in passing praise
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_2:0.0000:examples, Ricardo Quintana has praised the poem by claiming that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_3:0.0000:"of such high voltage is the satire, that the level of intensity,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_4:0.0250:instead of declining as the piece continues, rises steadily from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_5:0.0000:couplet to couplet,' while on the other hand, Maurice Johnson has
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_6:0.0000:maintained of the same poem that its "tone is so constantly level
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_10:0.0500:Rapsody has served only, I suspect, to blunt the force, subtlety
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_11:0.0250:and point of the poem, just as frequent quotation, in usually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_12:0.0250:insipid contexts, of the famous lines cited above has elevated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_13:0.0000:them to a bad, because vacuous, eminence. What has been missed in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_14:0.0250:such criticism can be indicated by simply noting that these famous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_15:0.0000:lines, though almost tamed by mere quotation, are really the center
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_16:0.0000:of Swift's description of a society so vicious that in it each
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_17:0.0500:man's hand is lifted against each man's hand, that in it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_23:0.0250:This vicious society, I will argue, is the subject of the Rapsody
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_24:0.0250:and is one of Swift's most powerful depictions of the catastrophic
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_25:0.0000:results he thought to be implicit in the style of life he saw
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_26:0.0250:about him, a style he thought corruptive enough to reduce human
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_27:0.0250:life, as he tells us (beginning at line 319), to Hobbes' state of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_28:0.0250:nature--to a situation where the life of man is but one long combat.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_9:0.0500:well have fallen into either abuse or desuetude. It is a world
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_10:0.0250:where prelates thrive "who no God believe," public ministers min-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_11:0.0250:ister not, and no king rules. And because it is a world where all
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_12:0.0500:sense of office has been lost it is also a world where the very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_13:0.0250:order of society, degree itself, has disappeared. Thus, "statesmen"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_14:0.0250:grow indistinguishable from "south sea jobbers," "pick- purses"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_15:0.0000:from judges, and "duchesses" from common whores. Ultimately, it is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_17:0.0500:and degrees, those which spring from family, from the relationship
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_19:0.0500:vjhelmed.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_20:0.0250:A vivid insight into the subject and method of the Rapsodv
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_21:0.0000:can be gleaned by simply watching Swift build into the poem, by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_22:0.0250:allusion to familial relationship, a sense of the way the society
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_23:0.0000:he depicts has grown corrupt. For in the world which Swift por-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_24:0.0000:trays in the Rapsodv . neither a loving relationship of husband to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_25:0.0000:wife, nor legitimate parentage and the ties implied by it, are to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0085_26:0.0000:be found. Promiscuity and bastardy, rather, introduced very early
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_5:0.0250:activities described in the Rapsodv . Like the actual hordes of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_6:0.0000:beggars and gypsies who are so often anxiously mentioned by seven-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_7:0.0250:teenth and early eighteenth century preachers and whose masterless
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_8:0.0000:and wandering condition was thought to be an evil portent for society
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_9:0.0250:and a corruptive example to responsible men,^ the metaphor of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_10:0.0000:familial disintegration infects every strata of society and level
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_11:0.0000:of endeavor described in this poem. Yet, always in this background
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_12:0.0250:of bastardy and disinheritance there are reminders, in the very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_13:0.0500:terms Swift uses to create this background, that in well ordered
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_14:0.0250:societies it is the family, in its naturalness and mutual loving
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_15:0.0500:responsibilities, which has always been the supreme example for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_16:0.0250:the conduct of even the highest offices of society.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_17:0.0000:Thus, to cite the most obvious example of the use of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_18:0.0000:metaphor, the writing of bad poetry is repeatedly imaged in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_19:0.0000:Rapsodv as a type of misbegetting and unnatural parentage. And
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_20:0.0000:the perversions implicit in this comparison are especially pointed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_21:0.0000:since, in the eighteenth century the writing of not bad, but good,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_22:0.0000:poetry was often described in terms which suggest procreation.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_23:0.0000:Thus, for example. Pope defines the operation of true wit as "a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_24:0.0000:justness of thought and a faculty of expression; or (in the mid-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_25:0.0000:wife's phrase) a perfect conception with an easy delivery."^ In
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_26:0.0250:the Rapsodv. Pope's basic comparison of writing to begetting is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0086_27:0.0250:maintained but, since Swift is describing the generation of false
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_7:0.0500:As Swift developes this metaphoric comparison of bad poets
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_8:0.0000:and bad poetry with promiscuity, bastardy, and parental and filial
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_9:0.0000:ungratefulness, the moral ugliness which he thought was involved in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_10:0.0000:writing bad poetry becomes increasingly clear. Thus, he points
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_11:0.0250:out through this metaphor that the writer of bad verses not only
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_12:0.0000:commits an unnatural act in first v;riting but is then, all too
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_13:0.0000:often, forced to compound his first sin with another act even more
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_14:0.0250:unnatural: he is forced, in order to prevent discovery, to commit
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_15:0.0250:the metaphorical equivalent of child abandonment, "If you find,"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_26:0.0000:ting one's moral sense as well. As Swift indicates early in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_27:0.0000:poem, maintaining still a metaphor based upon a perversion of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_28:0.0250:familial relationship, the condition of poetry in the England this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0087_29:0.0250:poem describes is like the condition of a disinherited family line.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_13:0.0250:is approved by royalty, disaccredits the whole race of poets.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_14:0.0500:But promiscuity, bastardy and disinheritance are not, as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_15:0.0000:I have already indicated, reserved in this poem to the office of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_16:0.0000:poetry. Rather, Swift insists, these perversions reach to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_17:0.0000:highest of England's political offices, and much of the irony
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_18:0.0250:which permeates that praise of George II and his family, with which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_19:0.0000:Swift concludes the Rapsody . turns upon the contrast between the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_20:0.0250:familial harmony which ought to characterize England's ruling
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_21:0.0000:family and the scandalously public disharmony which actually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_22:0.0500:characterized both that family and its rule. For Swift's first
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_23:0.0250:readers, then, much of Swift's mock praise of George II served
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_24:0.0500:only as a reminder that George was as corrupt a natural husband
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0088_25:0.0250:and father as he was a kingly father. Thus, for example, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_6:0.0500:must have seemed a very thinly veiled allusion to that prince's un-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_7:0.0500:distinguished and undistinguishing promiscuity. Thus, much of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_8:0.0500:irony of this whole closing passage works to locate in the royal
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_9:0.0250:family that corruption of familial harmony which was first intro-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_13:0.0250:But even as it minutely records this disorder, the Rapsody
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_14:0.0000:itself is a poem of affirmation. For, as I shall argue throughout
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_15:0.0000:this essay, the perversely inharmonious world of foolish men which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_16:0.0500:the Rapsody describes is judged in the very terms of its descrip-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_17:0.0000:tion. Thus, to cite an example we have already seen, the whole
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_18:0.0000:efficaciousness of Swift's description of the Rapsody' s world in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_19:0.0000:terms of promiscuity, bastardy and disinheritance depends upon our
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_20:0.0000:seeing, in the midst of Swift's irony, his insistence that the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_21:0.0250:great pattern of well ordered states has traditionally been proper
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_22:0.0000:familial relationship. Our mode of reading the Rapsody , then,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_23:0.0250:must be something like the method Edward Young commended in reading
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_24:0.0000:Scripture; it must be read by measuring its descriptions of men
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_25:0.0250:against what is requires of man in order that its "Satire on the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0089_26:0.0500:weakness and iniquity of man "^ may be of profit.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_0:0.0500:73
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_1:0.0000:xl
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_3:0.0500:(at line 393) in his poem, the Rapsody was written in an age when
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_13:0.0000:of bad rhymers emblemized, to Augustans like Swift and Pope, an
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_14:0.0250:entire society strayed loose from its traditional moorings, a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_16:0.0250:Indeed, the first seventy lines of the Rapsody are per-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_17:0.0250:meated with Swift's astonishment at such men as have run mad
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_18:0.0000:after the name of poet, since, as Swift assures us, the office of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_19:0.0000:poet has never worked to the apparent worldly good of any man so
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0090_20:0.0250:unfortunate to be called to serve in it. Not beggars' brats, nor
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0091_3:0.0000:station. Of these miseries the most probable, of course, was the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0091_10:0.0500:the lot of those who pretended to letters. Indeed, even prominence
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0091_11:0.0000:in the world of letters, Swift makes clear, was no assurance of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0091_12:0.0250:either political or financial security. Pope, Swift notes, being
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0091_13:0.0000:Catholic, could not approach the court from which Gay was ul-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_2:0.0250:be wits from Swift's own vision of man's proper role that, having
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_3:0.0250:once ansv/ered it, he raises the same question all over again.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_4:0.0000:Here, that is, as throughout the Rapsody , we can sense not only
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_5:0.0250:Swift's anger, but also his astonishment, at that man who, having
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_9:0.0500:(23-24)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_11:0.0500:there are no clear norms to judge those men whom Swift satirizes,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_12:0.0000:in fact. Swift's own conviction that each man is so peculiarly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_13:0.0500:endowed for his proper role that it takes an astoundingly energetic
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_14:0.0000:act of willful perversity to avoid that role is made clear enough
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_15:0.0000:even in the first paragraph of the poem. In that paragraph Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_16:0.0250:compares man's chronic failure to follow his own natural bent with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_17:0.0000:the ease with which "Brutes find out where their talents lie."
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_18:0.0000:The comparison was a popular one through the sixteenth and seven-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_19:0.0250:teenth centuries; Swift might have found it in several places
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_20:0.0000:in both Montaigne and Pascal and, of course, he uses it in several
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_21:0.0250:places himself. But in the Rapsody Swift works an illuminating
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_22:0.0250:variation on the standard use of this comparison. Customarily, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_23:0.0000:both Montaigne and Pascal, for example, the comparison is used to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_24:0.0000:remind proud man that in some ways, at least, the condition of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_25:0.0000:brutes is preferable to the condition of man, to remind men that,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0092_26:0.0250:though they consider themselves lords of the universe, in some
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_2:0.0250:use of this coraparison is, of course, like those of Montaigne and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_3:0.0000:Pascal, directed against man's pride, but his emphasis is different
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_4:0.0000:from theirs; for Swift's point is not that nature has been a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_5:0.0000:kinder mother to brutes than to man but that man is simply the most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_6:0.0250:perverse of nature's children, the only creature, as Swift ob-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_13:0.0000:wrong. And therefore, unlike the dog which. Swift tells us, knows
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_14:0.0000:to "turn aside" Xvzhen it "sees the ditch too deep and wide," man
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_15:0.0000:not only leaps into the ditch, but, as we shall see later in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_16:0.0000:poem, even attempts to invert the whole world in order to make a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_23:0.0500:There is, however, both in Swift's certainty that each
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_24:0.0000:man has a particular role to play and in his condemnation of those
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_25:0.0000:would-be poets who undertake a vocation to which they are not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_26:0.0000:called, something quite alien to a culture which, like ours, is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_27:0.0000:secular. Generally, in twentieth century European and American
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0093_29:0.0500:complex process, since it has been understood to depend upon a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_2:0.0250:man happiest, most intellectually stimulated or most prosperous.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_3:0.0500:One must simply observe that Swift had not this way of thinking;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_4:0.0250:rather, as he makes abundantly clear in several of his sermons,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_5:0.0000:and particularly in that sermon titled, The Duty of Mutual
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_7:0.0250:view of the matter, simply could not be the primary consideration
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_9:0.0000:ness was itself dependent upon another consideration, how useful
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_10:0.0000:a man might make his own advantages of wisdom, power or wealth to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_11:0.0000:his neighbor. "If a man doth not use those advantages to the Good
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_12:0.0500:of the Publick," Swift observed.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_15:0.0250:intended them for a Blessing to him; and on the other
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_16:0.0000:side, whoever doth employ his Talents as he ought, x^ill
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_17:0.0000:find by his own Experience, that they were chiefly lent
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_18:0.0500:him for the Service of others: for to the Service of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_20:0.0250:Indeed, Swift is willing to argue the proposition that each
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0094_22:0.0250:to devote it to the service of others even with respect to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_2:0.0250:tial happiness, must a man find his proper calling. As Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_3:0.0000:argues, this world is providentially so ordered that the good of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_4:0.0000:each particular man, and of society as a whole, is dependent upon
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_5:0.0000:the willingness of each particular man to serve his neighbor; as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_6:0.0000:each man is dependent upon his neighbor's skills, so each man must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_7:0.0500:bend his talents in subjection to his neighbor's good. Thus,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_11:0.0000:which the whole frame of the World under his Providence
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_13:0.0500:ticular Stations are appointed to each of us by God
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_17:0.0250:towards advancing the Benefit of the Whole, in propor-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_19:0.0250:useless, but a very mischievous Member of the Publick;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_26:0.0250:bends his whole designs" against the inclinations of his own
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_27:0.0000:genius errs profoundly against both himself and his fellow man.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_28:0.0000:He errs against himself because his own happiness, whether he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_29:0.0250:acknowledges it or not, depends upon the serviceable utilization
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_30:0.0500:of his talents. And he errs against others since each abuse of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_31:0.0000:one's own talents represents a choice, no matter how mistaken, of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_32:0.0000:one's own good before the good of one's neighbor, and each such
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_33:0.0000:choice must weaken those bonds of mutual responsibility which are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0095_34:0.0000:the very makings of a society. Thus, the "uncalled" poets Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_2:0.0250:their own individual ill; they are, rather, at once active in and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_3:0.0250:emblematic of a general social disaster. And their culpability
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_4:0.0500:extends beyond their having abandoned those offices and responsi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_5:0.0250:bilities to which their God-given talents gave them a natural and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_6:0.0500:legitimate claim; for the office which they subsequently overrun
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_7:0.0500:simply by force of their numbers is exactly that office which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_8:0.0500:traditionally has been considered primarily responsible for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_9:0.0250:teaching what they, in even attempting poetry, have forgotten--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_10:0.0500:the art, as Horace put it, to "bring all things to their proper
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_13:0.0500:For Swift, then, what made doubly dangerous this headlong
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_14:0.0000:rush of men from their proper spheres to a vocation for which they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_15:0.0000:had no calling is that it involved not only the abandonment of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_16:0.0000:their several stations, but it meant also the adulteration by un-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_17:0.0000:fit men of an office of particular significance; an office for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_18:0.0000:which. Swift assures us early in the Rapsody , many may feel called,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_2:0.0250:scorn back into the lines just cited; that is, Swift's critics
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_3:0.0000:have understood these lines to signify just the opposite of what
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_4:0.0250:they say. There is, however, no real reason to so interpret
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_7:0.0500:To begin with. Swift, in claiming that the office of poet
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_8:0.0000:required a special grace and therefore, implicitly, served a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_9:0.0000:special function, does no more than state an intellectual common-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_10:0.0000:place which presumably he, as well as his contemporaries, in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_11:0.0000:herited from the ages which preceded his. Horace had claimed that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_12:0.0000:the particular function of poetry was Aut prodesse volunt, aut de-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_13:0.0250:lectare and, as Thomas Maresca has recently argued, ■'■'^ Horace's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_14:0.0250:maxim was repeated, with special emphasis on and expansion of its
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_15:0.0250:first alternative, throughout the seventeenth century. "I could
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_17:0.0250:. . .think the study of wisdom confined only to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_23:0.0500:Wee do not require in him mere elocution, or an ex-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_24:0.0000:cellent faculty in verse, but the exact knowledge of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_28:0.0500:for it exactly the same claim which Jonson had made more generally
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0097_29:0.0000:for all poetry--and does so almost in Jonson 's words. The work of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_0:0.0500:86
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_4:0.0500:This vision of poetry, as at once the repository of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_5:0.0000:particular truths of divinity, philosophy and politics and the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_6:0.0000:ideal fountainhead for these truths is, in fact, the common denomi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_7:0.0000:nator not only of one, but of more than two centuries of English
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_8:0.0250:critical thought and unifies tracts so disparate in time and diverse
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_9:0.0500:in spirit as Sidney's joyous Defense of Poesy and Sir William
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_10:0.0000:Temple's almost phlegmatic Of Poetry . As long as Horace's state-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_11:0.0250:ment of the efficacy of poetry in teaching virtues and civility
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_12:0.0000:continued to command respect, it provided a common basis for cri-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_13:0.0000:tical thought. It was, therefore, as true for Dryden as for Sid-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_14:0.0250:ney, for Pope as for Jonson, that poetry, because it illuminates
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_15:0.0000:the universal through the particular by teaching morality through
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_16:0.0000:clearly praiseworthy and blameworthy examples, is the ideal vehicle
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_17:0.0250:to render virtues love and their contraries hated. Indeed, just
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_18:0.0000:because poetry was considered to be at once so efficacious and so
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_19:0.0000:necessary in "insensibly influencing" a people to virtuous action,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_20:0.0000:many a seventeenth century critic, like Sir William Davenant,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_22:0.0000:muses" no Divine or Leader of Armies, no Statesman or Judge could
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_23:0.0000:reasonably expect "a long or quiet satisfaction in government . "■'•^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_24:0.0000:This whole background of ideas defining the nature of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_25:0.0000:poetry and, more importantly, the ends poetry is to serve is, both
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_26:0.0000:by the title Swift chose to give his poem and by the way he chose
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_27:0.0250:to narrate most of it, made almost constantly available as a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0098_28:0.0250:standard of judgment against which the activities imaged in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_1:0.0500:poem can be measured. The significance of the first half of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_2:0.0250:title is rather obvious; "On Poetry" refers back to that group of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_3:0.0000:similarly titled works which, as they reflected Horace's moral
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_4:0.0250:view of poetry's function, reflected also the popular title of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_5:0.0250:his fullest exposition of his view, the Ars Poetica . The signifi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_6:0.0250:cance of the second half of the title, however, may be somewhat
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_7:0.0250:obscured for a twentieth century reader since both the connota-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_8:0.0250:tion and denotation of the word "rhapsody" have changed consider-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_9:0.0500:ably since Swift used it. To the twentieth cencary reader the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_10:0.0000:word normally denotes a specific type of music which is agreeable
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_11:0.0000:because of its charming lyrical freedom. In the eighceencn cen-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_12:0.0000:tury, however, the word was often used to refer co any work which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_13:0.0000:was distinguished by an unhappy disorder. Thus Pope, writing to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_14:0.0000:Swift in 1729, defined by the word "rhapsody" the opposite of true
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_22:0.0250:In the Rapsody , in fact, this disordering process is not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_23:0.0000:only described, its very workings are, as we shall see, demon-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_24:0.0000:strated. Up to line seventy, as we have already noted, the as-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_25:0.0000:tonished narrator of the Rapsody seems to be Swift himself, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_26:0.0000:the mode of narration is a reasonably straight-forward description
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_27:0.0000:of disorder. After line seventy, however, the narration of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_28:0.0250:Rapsody becomes a subtler matter. We are introduced to a narrator
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0099_29:0.0250:who himself illustrates the actual force of disorder as it corrupts
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_2:0.0500:in fact, a perverse Ars Poetica , echoing, in its variegated sub-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_3:0.0500:jects, oscillating style and in the very wording of its advice,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_4:0.0000:that Horatian collection of practical advice, historical review,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_5:0.0500:and social commentary which served as the foundation of that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_6:0.0000:traditional view of poetry which we have discussed above.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_15:0.0500:Thus Swift introduces what is probably some of the subtlest and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_16:0.0250:most compact poetry he ever wrote by prefacing it with lines which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_17:0.0000:are themselves perplexing. The narrator of the coming lines, Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_18:0.0000:tells us here, is an "old experienc'd sinner." But, although Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_19:0.0000:calls this narrator a sinner, it is not very clear why he does so,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_20:0.0250:since he also tells us that the instructions which this sinner
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_21:0.0250:will offer are instructions in that art which is most necessary
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_22:0.0000:to all potential poets--and generalized, to all good men--the art
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_23:0.0000:of distinguishing between true poetic calling and a mere scribbling
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_24:0.0500:itch, between true vocation and mere whimsy.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_25:0.0500:But, despite the initially confusing character of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_29:0.0500:"of diff'rent Spirits to discern," Swift echoes a text, I Corinthians 12 ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_2:0.0250:very justly on his mind. The text is that particularly famous one
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_3:0.0000:in which Paul urges each man to be satisfied with his own particu-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_4:0.0250:lar spiritual gifts since, "v;hile there are diversity of gifts. . ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_5:0.0250:it is the same God which worketh all in all." Illustrating this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_13:0.0000:is a gift which, since it rests in God's hands to give or to with-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_14:0.0500:hold, it would be presumptious to attempt to learn and almost
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_15:0.0250:V7orse than presumptious to offer to teach. That an "old sinner"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_18:0.0250:But knowing the source and probable import of this allu-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_19:0.0500:sion seemingly does more to confound than to clarify the lines
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_20:0.0250:in which it occurs. We are now faced with a sinner-instructor who
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_21:0.0000:apparently will at once attempt to teach what is not only unteach-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_22:0.0000:able but an impious violation of God's prerogative even to attempt
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_23:0.0000:to teach and yet who will at the same time teach the art to know
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_24:0.0000:vocation, to distinguish between the poet's vein and the scribbling
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_25:0.0000:itch. Yet, as confusing as these lines apparently are, they do
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_26:0.0500:define, by the very paradox they present, the character of the sin-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0101_27:0.0500:ner-instructor's admonitions. For, on the one hand, these admonitions
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_2:0.0250:makes clear in the first fifty lines of the Ars Poetica , the first
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_3:0.0000:thing needful for a poet is a sure sense of vocation and of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_4:0.0000:limits and strengths of his poetic gifts. But, on the other hand,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_5:0.0000:the sinner-instructor misapplies the Horatian advice which he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_6:0.0000:appropriates by promoting with that advice a kind of selfishness
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_7:0.0500:inimicably opposed to Horace's own social and moral views.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_28:0.0500:must seem very familiar. The first eight lines, for example, very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_2:0.0500:"blot out, correct, insert, refine" is, in its very wording, re-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_7:0.0500:ditional advice and with the reverence with which it is usually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_8:0.0000:given that makes the final, jingling, meaningless couplet of this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_9:0.0000:first speech so surprising. For while the sinner-instructor's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_10:0.0500:sudden collapse into trivia does not in any way detract from the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_11:0.0000:validity of the Horatian advice he has just offered, it does in-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_12:0.0000:dicate that he has not really understood but simply mouthed that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_13:0.0000:advice. Unconcernedly unaware of the viex^ of poetry's nature and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_14:0.0000:function which this advice both inculcates and assumes, the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_15:0.0000:sinner- instructor has appropriated it and, mixing in his own non-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_16:0.0250:sense, attempted to make it serve him as an impressive opening.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_17:0.0000:And this method of first appropriating the terms of that moral and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_18:0.0000:traditional poetic discussed above and then turning them to serve
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_19:0.0250:the interests of his own vanity and avarice is the whole foundation
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_20:0.0500:of the sinner- instructor 's own method of instruction and the whole
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_21:0.0000:point of the craft he teaches.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_22:0.0250:For the sinner-instructor, as he makes explicitly clear in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_23:0.0000:several places, the entire end of the art of poetry is to enhance
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_24:0.0000:the reputation and enrich the purses of its practitioners. By
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_25:0.0000:its success or failure to accomplish this end, he judges the worth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0103_26:0.0250:of all poetry, and towards the accomplishing of this end he bends
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_2:0.0250:and blame is an essential element of their craft. But for Dryden
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_3:0.0250:and for Jonson, as we have seen above, the poetic function of parti-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_4:0.0250:cular praise and blame is subservient to the teaching of moral
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_5:0.0250:universals, to the teaching of what is virtuous by making it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_6:0.0250:appear amiable and what is vicious by making clear its detest-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_7:0.0250:ability. On the other hand, for the sinner-instructor there ap-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_8:0.0250:parently are no moral universals. Rather, for him, good and evil,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_9:0.0250:true and false, virtue and vice are only so many names. These
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_10:0.0250:names, as he makes clear, have no referral value at all for him;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_11:0.0250:they are simply terms of vague approbation or disapprobation to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_12:0.0500:be assigned in accord with the selfish interest of a particular
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_13:0.0500:poet. Thus, for him, a prince is not called virtuous because he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_14:0.0250:participates in virtue. Rather "a prince," he instructs his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_15:0.0250:pupils, "the moment he is crown'd, [ is said to] Inherit ev ' ry
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_16:0.0500:Virtue round" (191-192), because to say so is one of the ways to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_17:0.0250:thrive.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_18:0.0250:Because, that is, the sinner-instructor's advice is founded
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_19:0.0000:in mean self-interest, his advice inculcates an ethical relativism
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_20:0.0000:which sweepingly dismisses all notion of absolute good and evil.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_21:0.0000:Good and evil, for the sinner-instructor, refer only to things or
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_22:0.0000:acts which do, or do not, constitute ways to thrive. It is good,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_23:0.0000:the sinner-instructor maintains, to praise bad kings, to defend
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_24:0.0000:corrupt statesmen, to plagerize from Horace and Longinus, because
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_25:0.0500:all these are ways to thrive. And thus the sinner-instructor's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_26:0.0000:advice is the absolutely corrupt reversal of the traditional pur-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_27:0.0500:pose of poetry: traditionally, as we have seen above, poetry en-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0104_28:0.0500:couraged men to do the good by showing them that to do the good
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_5:0.0500:philosphic system of one man, Thomas Hobbes, was consistently
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_6:0.0500:reviled for promoting precisely the kind of etaicai relativism
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_7:0.0500:which characterizes the sinner- instructor ' s advice. '^^ "Good, evil,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_8:0.0500:and contemptible," Hobbes maintained, "are ever used with relation,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_9:0.0000:to the person that useth them: there being nothing simply or
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_10:0.0000:absolutely so."^^ Naturally enough then, it is to Hobbes' des-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_11:0.0000:cription of nature as fundamentally lawless and subsequently savage
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_12:0.0000:that the sinner- instructor refers in order to provide a general and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_13:0.0500:authoritative statement of his own view of the human situation.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_20:0.0500:And because the sinner- instructor ' s prescriptions for human conduct,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_21:0.0500:though recognizably corrupt, are also recognizable descriptions of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_22:0.0000:the way most men do act (men do, after all, praise bad kings, defend
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_23:0.0000:bad ministers, plagerize, and get bastards), the sinner- instructor ' s
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_24:0.0000:identification of Hobbes' view of man's condition as the basis of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_25:0.0000:his own advice brings home, I think, the real sting of Swift's satire.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_26:0.0000:Men do, that is, live as if Hobbes is right, and they suffer for it:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_27:0.0250:men live as if there is no "common rule of good and evil to be taken
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_5:0.0000:which is the foundation of the sinner- instructor ' s advice can be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_6:0.0000:seen finally as an explanation for the vicious world the Rapsody
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_7:0.0000:describes. That world is, as we have already seen, one characterized
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_8:0.0000:by the imagery of familial disharmony. What we can see now is how
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_9:0.0000:completely appropriate this imagery is; for the world of the Rapsody
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_10:0.0250:is one in which the very principles of natural relationship and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_11:0.0000:legitimacy have been replaced by a relativism at once so thorough-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_12:0.0000:going and so debilitating that it has obliterated not only the dis-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_13:0.0000:tinctions of natural and unnatural, and good and bad, but of up and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_14:0.0000:down as well. Thus, the poets described in the Rapsody , disdaining
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_15:0.0000:the heights of poetry, pervert even the natural metaphor arising
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_16:0.0250:from the action of gravity, "And with rebellious Arms pretend/
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_17:0.0250:An equal Priv'lege to descend " (381-382). Unwilling to acknow-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_18:0.0000:ledge any rule but the rule of self, disclaiming that either they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_19:0.0000:themselves or anything else has a "proper native use," the princes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_20:0.0000:and prelates and especially the poets of the Rapsody' s world live
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_21:0.0000:in a constant state of rebellion against both the facts of nature--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_22:0.0000:gravity for example--and against each other. Thus, it is for their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_23:0.0000:own foolish presumption that they suffer. "Teazing, pinching and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_24:0.0000:biting" each other, the men of this poem are shown punishing each
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_25:0.0250:other while all conspire to corrupt, through selfish manipulation,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0106_26:0.0500:the goods of Church, State and poetry, the traditional sources of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_5:0.0000:kind of full length, poetic demonstration of Swift's thesis, cited
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_6:0.0000:in full above, that "most of the miseries and misfortunes in Life"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_7:0.0000:are attendant simply upon the abuse and selfish misapplication of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_8:0.0000:one's own goods and talents. Indeed, it is emblematic of the self-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_9:0.0000:inflicted nature of misfortune that the instructions of our sinner-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_10:0.0000:instructor follow a significantly descending path, that this guide
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_11:0.0250:in blind selfishness only manages to proffer his disciples ever
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_12:0.0000:less noble stations for ever more base reasons. Thus, the proteges
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_13:0.0000:whom he had encouraged, as the Rapsody began, in a mistaken aspiration
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_14:0.0250:to poetry, are gradually brought to seek their very bread through
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_15:0.0250:party writing and then paid panegyrics and finally empty criticism.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_16:0.0250:But, further, as one reads through the Rapsody one senses,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_17:0.0000:also, that its tone involves something even more than Swift's ire
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_18:0.0500:with man's propensity to wound himself on his own selfishness.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_19:0.0500:One hears, too, running through the whole of the Rapsody, Swift ' s
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_20:0.0000:moral indignation and his insistence that a man's neglect of proper
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_21:0.0000:vocation is an act against God as well as an act against himself,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_22:0.0250:a sin, that is, as well as a folly. And this deeper moral condem-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0107_23:0.0250:nation is, given Swift's view of vocation, exactly what we might
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_3:0.0500:At the risk, then, of explaining the obvious, one must ob-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_4:0.0000:serve that the "old experienc'd sinner," to whose corruptive measures
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_5:0.0000:so much of the Rapsody' s world seems to dance, is a very sinner
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_6:0.0000:indeed. Snatching a bit of Horace here, commending a passage of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_7:0.0000:Longinus there, he is actively engaged in recruiting men from cheir
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_8:0.0000:assigned callings to service amongst his band. Like the very devil
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_9:0.0250:himself, to whom it does not seem inappropriate to compare him,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_10:0.0250:he tempts men through their pride to disobedience of God. And in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_11:0.0000:the Rapsody' s England his followers are legion and they are all
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_12:0.0250:damned.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_14:0.0000:with which kings, at death, re-establish their courts in hell to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_15:0.0250:ply in "the scenes of endless woe... their former arts below"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_16:0.0250:(209-210); between the world of the Rapsody and hell itself, there
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_17:0.0000:is finally very little difference. Indeed, throughout the dark and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_18:0.0000:divided world of the Rapsody , with its futile activity, dark intestine
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_19:0.0250:wars. Godless priests and pecks of coal, there constantly shimmers,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_20:0.0000:I believe. Swift's suggestion that England has been transformed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_22:0.0500:It is not, however, until the last lines of the poem that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_23:0.0000:we can see fully the blasphemous nature of the rapsodic world which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_24:0.0000:Swift has portrayed. But in his final condemnation Swift is as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0108_25:0.0250:ironically explicit as one could wish: "For many a year," Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_6:0.0500:The Woolston to whom the final line of the poem refers is, I think,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_7:0.0250:the Thomas Woolston who, in 1713-14, published the most famous of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_8:0.0000:his numerous tracts-- those six discourses which he together titled,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_9:0.0000:On the Miracles of Our Saviour . "^-^ These tracts were thought dangerous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_10:0.0000:enough in their time to have drawn numerous rebuttals; and dangerous,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_11:0.0000:in fact, they were. For in them Woolston, with an ingenuousness
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_12:0.0250:which is even today disarming, attempted to argue that since he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_13:0.0250:found the miracles of Christ, as described by Scripture, unamenable
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_14:0.0000:to his own reason, they therefore absolutely could not have occured.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_15:0.0000:Rather, V/oolston argued, each of Christ's miracles, indeed, the New
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_16:0.0000:Testament itself, is literally untrue. But, Woolston continued,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_17:0.0000:the New Testament does allegorically figure forth the truth. And
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_18:0.0000:that truth, as refined by Woolston' s own reason, is that Christ
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_19:0.0000:has not been but is coming, and the miracles attributed to him in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_20:0.0000:the Nev7 Testament but figure forth the greater and (Woolston trusted)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_21:0.0250:more reasonable miracles which he will perform.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_22:0.0500:History has, of course, relegated Woolston and his tracts
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_23:0.0250:to obscurity but, nevertheless, because of his enormous presumption,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_24:0.0000:because of his willingness to deny Christ's intercession for man
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_25:0.0000:simply because the mode of it did not please him, because, in short,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_2:0.0250:the proper use of all things and neglect especially God's particular
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_3:0.0000:calling to them. Indeed, after Woolston's comically tiny, yet
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_4:0.0250:damningly real, denial of God, the sudden end of the poem seems,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_5:0.0000:to me at least, entirely appropriate. For the resultant hiatus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_6:0.0000:seems somehow to echo in its sudden emptiness the world the poem
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_9:0.0500:apocalyptic-- "Caetera desiderantur , " Swift notes, the rest is wanting.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_10:0.0250:Yet, just because Swift's final portrait of a rapsodized
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_11:0.0000:England, lapsing into Godlessness, is so very dark, it would be,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_12:0.0000:I think, a particularly unhappy oversight to close this study without
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_13:0.0000:reminding ourselves of that powerful commitment to his own calling
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_14:0.0250:and to true justice which inform the extent and nature of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_15:0.0000:gloom. For if, in the Rapsody , Swift's condemnation of his generation
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_16:0.0000:and of its works reaches almost a prophet's dark scorn, it has some-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0110_17:0.0250:thing too, of the prophet's moral certitude. At the very real risk
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0111_0:0.0500:NOTES
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0111_5:0.0500:3. Ricardo Quintana, The Mind and Art of Jonathan Svift (New
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0112_17:0.0500:Walpole forbore prosecuting Swift himself only because he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_15:0.0000:through "reason" and his own "experience," the universal scope and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_20:0.0250:The second section of the poem (73-298) is an application of the maxim
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_21:0.0000:to a specific and extreme case: in this section Swift imagines the nig-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_22:0.0250:gling comforts and ignoble sentiir.ents which his death will stimulate in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_23:0.0000:most of his friends. But the final, panegyrical section of the poem--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_24:0.0000:which Swift imagines spoken a year after his death and by "one quite
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0113_25:0.0250:indifferent in the cause"--seems to exist in flat contradiction both to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_0:0.0500:section of the poem Swift offers himself as that man to whose actions
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_7:0.0250:troubled Swift's contemporaries quite as much as it has his modern
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_9:0.0500:tion of the Verses to William King, King excised almost the whole of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_12:0.0000:Life and Genuine Character of Dr. Swift . This Kir,g aid, a^aicst cer-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_13:0.0500:tainly, with the advice of Alexander Pope, whose opinion of the origi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_14:0.0500:nal poem was that "the latter part. . .is inferior to t\-i^ beginning,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0114_23:0.0500:very willing to submit his work to the correction of his friends, he was
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_2:0.0000:illuminating. The first of these, titled "The Ironic Intention of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_3:0.0000:Swift's Verses on his own death," was argued by Barry Slepian in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_4:0.0000:1963. In this article Professor Slepian maintains that in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_5:0.0000:panegyric which ends the Verses Swift consciously completes his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_6:0.0000:thesis that all mankind is "egotistical, selfish and proud" jy
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_7:0.0500:showing himself to be so. While finally, I thinK, we shall see
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_8:0.0250:that Professor Slepian 's insistence that the whole of the panegyric
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_9:0.0000:is ironic pushes a good insight too far, .nevertheless his assumption
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_10:0.0000:that Swift would hardly have written a panegyric upon himself with-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_11:0.0000:out some leavening irony seems very sane. Certainly some of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_12:0.0250:examples Slepian uses to illustrate this irony are very convincing;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_13:0.0250:he reminds ^s, for example, that the lines in whicr. Swire, apparently
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_14:0.0500:ingenuously, praises his own originality carry an ironic burden:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_22:0.0500:Nevertheless, to show that these lines, or even many lines
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_23:0.0500:of the panegyric, have an ironic value is not to prove that all
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_24:0.0250:the lines are ironic or that the whole design of the panegyric is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_25:0.0000:ironic. Slepian's thesis, however, leads him to find irony every-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_26:0.0250:where and to assert its presence where he cannot demonstrate it.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0115_27:0.0500:Thus, when he suggests that the following lines are obviously ironic
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_8:0.0500:The language of these lines is dramatic, it is true, but they are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_9:0.0250:written on a subject about which Swift is usually dramatic. In his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_10:0.0000:o\^m epitaph Swift defines his commitment to liberty even more dramati-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_11:0.0000:cally than he has defined it in these lines, but I do not think that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_12:0.0500:even Slepian would suggest this epitaph is intentionally ironic.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_18:0.0250:In the context of Swift's normal practices, therefore, it is insuf-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_21:0.0500:There is, too, a more serious objection to be raised to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_22:0.0000:Slepian' s treatment of the Verses , and this objection is raised
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_23:0.0000:in an article written by Marshall Waingrow and published in 1964.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_24:0.0000:As Waingrow understands, the effect of reading the final part of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_25:0.0000:the poem (as Slepian does) as a perfect piece of irony is to destroy
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_26:0.0000:any possibility of discovering a moral norm in the poem. And to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_27:0.0250:despair of finding a moral norm in Swift's Verses is, as Waingrow
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0116_28:0.0500:feels, a particularly perverse way of dealing with a poen; in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_1:0.0500:to offer himself as a model of moral perception and behavior, , . .'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_2:0.0250:Waingrow, therefore, attempts to deal with Swift's praise of him-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_3:0.0250:self as a straight-forward yet very useful praise. Swift ^ W^iugrow
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_4:0.0000:argues, generously takes the occasion of his ow.i death noc only co
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_5:0.0250:demonstrate the selfish responses of most men to their fellows'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_6:0.0000:suffering, adversity and death, but also to provide men a model
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_7:0.0000:(which apparently is desperately needed) of truly selfless conduct.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_8:0.0000:Swift's panegyric, therefore, is not a demonstration of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_9:0.0000:selfishness, but is rather, Waingrow maintains, & proof of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_10:0.0500:utter selflessness and a complete rebuttal of La Rochefoucauld's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_11:0.0500:maxim. Swift's conduct in penning his panegyric is, Wi^ingrow con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_12:0.0000:tinues, in sharp contrast to che conduce of even Pope, G^y av.d
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_13:0.0000:Arbuthnot, who have been, like almost all the vorld, j>o "corrupted"
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_14:0.0250:by the fact i.i^^ they must die that they cannot forget themselves
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_15:0.0000:long enough to r..ourn Swift's passing. Swift, however, is not thus
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_16:0.0250:"corrupted;" he remains "superiour to his fate" ar.d triumphs over
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_17:0.0000:even "the one absolutely inescapable physical condition of human
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_18:0.0000:existence, the necessity of dying" by makii-.g that "necessity" but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_19:0.0250:another occasion to teach what Waingrow calls "the code of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_20:0.0000:moralist"--"public uses, not private ends" should be the concern
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0117_21:0.0250:of the good man. Thus, as Waingrow concludes his essay, "the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_2:0.0000:LraLioii iiito the Vcr. •:(■.': to liave appeared so far and is therefore
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_3:0.0000:the natural starting point for further thought on Swift's poem.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_4:0.0250:Nevertheless, there are several objections which must, I think,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_5:0.0000:be raised both about particular points in the article and finally
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_6:0.0250:about its entire thesis. To begin with, Waingrow's refutation of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_7:0.0000:Slepian's article seems a bit too thorough. Some of the irony
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_8:0.0000:Slepian argues for in the panegyric seems to be legitimately there.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_9:0.0000:Therefore, a complete and completely acceptable reading of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_10:0.0000:Verses must account for the presence of this irony in terms which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_11:0.0000:relate it to the import of the entire poem. Further, Waingrow seems
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_12:0.0000:to strain some of the lines of the poem in order to accommodate them
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_13:0.0250:to his total thesis--his view of Swift as a model of selfless conduct.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_14:0.0250:Thus, for example, when he argues that Swift seriously intends, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_15:0.0000:the Verses , to chastise Pope, Gay and Arbuthnot "for their poor capa-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_16:0.0000:city for mourning," he neglects, I think, both the tone of Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_17:0.0250:lines and Swift's lifelong habit of penning what may appear to be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_18:0.0250:"a satyr where he most commends." The lines which characterize the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0118_26:0.0500:ever in so frail a lamp as man," his clear-eyed knowledge of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_2:0.0500:fact we will recognize more clearly if, as Charles Williams' suggests,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_3:0.0500:we honestly ask ourselves "for which of our friends we should come
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_7:0.0000:Finally, Waingrow's neglect of the ironic undertone which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_8:0.0250:Slepian detected in Swift's final panegyric and Waingrow's failure
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_9:0.0000:to see, in the midst of Swift's satire, the real commendation Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_10:0.0000:presents to those he loves, both stem from a more serious problem in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_11:0.0250:Waingrow's reading. In his desire for us to see that the panegyric
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_12:0.0000:is a moral exemplum Waingrow, I think, has discriminated far too
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_13:0.0000:sharply between the unselfish goodness of Swift and the corruption
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_14:0.0000:of all the world besides. The distinction is not, I think, nearly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_15:0.0000:so sharply made in the poem: Swift sometimes, particularly at the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_16:0.0000:beginning of the poem, is made a less than noble figure, while Pope,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_17:0.0000:for example, so affected by the death of Swift as to mourn a full
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_18:0.0000:month, is himself exemplary. To neglect these facts is to overlook
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_19:0.0000:the strategy of the poem.. Indeed, to push too far the difference
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_20:0.0000:between Swift and the rest of the world is to create a sophisticated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_21:0.0000:version of the problem its early readers had with it. King found the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_22:0.0250:final section of the Verses a self-praise which was vain; Waingrow,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_23:0.0000:I think, finally makes the panegyric a model which is inimitable.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_24:0.0000:To see Swift finally as a man of only public ends — and to identify
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_25:0.0000:no way by which he became so — is to place him beyond the grasp of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_26:0.0000:us poor mortals whom Swift is trying to teach. Rather, I think,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_27:0.0500:the panegyric is qualified — and qualified not only by the ironic
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0119_28:0.0500:undertones which run through it but by the entire progress of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_2:0.0000:on the Death of Dr. Swift is a justification of the satirist, or a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_3:0.0250:model for us, or anything else, the poena is a deeply personal, and,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_4:0.0250:at the same time, very traditional consideration by Swift of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_5:0.0000:implications of his o\m death. If Swift warrants the panegyric at
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_6:0.0250:the end of the poem, and if we can learn from it, it is because, I
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_7:0.0250:think, he has followed the command-- momento mori --and has drawn from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_8:0.0000:his meditation that truth which is the traditional end of such
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_13:0.0500:age but through the course of his entire life — we know both by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_14:0.0250:inference and by direct statement. "When I was your age," Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_15:0.0000:wrote to Pope, when Pope was forty-five, "I thought every day of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_16:0.0000:Death, but now [when Swift was sixty-six] every minute." Even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_17:0.0000:the briefest examination of Swift's correspondence makes clear that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_18:0.0000:this apparently hyperbolic statement lacks very little of being
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_19:0.0000:absolute truth. From a surprisingly early period of his life, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0120_20:0.0000:to all manner of correspondents. Swift observed that he was one
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_1:0.0500:from his point of view — from England, Swif.'u arrived in Dublir; in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_3:0.0500:not, his correspondence would indicate, unto death; but, character-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_4:0.0000:istically, he projected his sickness and loneliness into the death-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_5:0.0500:bed poem, In Sickness , which, though it was composed thirty years
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_14:0.0500:Swift's tendency to make his own illnesses, the illnesses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_15:0.0000:and deaths of his friends, indeed, even the wearing out of his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_16:0.0000:old cassocks, occasions for reflections on his own end is partly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_17:0.0250:attributable, perhaps, to his own particular affliction. He was,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_18:0.0000:the whole of his adult life, the victim of Meniere's disease, •'■^
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_19:0.0000:Since this disease of the inner ear was completely unknown to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_20:0.0000:physicians of Swift's age, its victim only knew that he could ex-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_21:0.0000:pect to be suddenly overcome, at irregular intervals, by severe
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_22:0.0250:and protracted attacks of deafness, extreme giddyness and nausea.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_23:0.0000:To be subject at any moment to such dark and debilitating attacks
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_24:0.0500:might well influence a man to think often on the frailty of his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0121_25:0.0250:own flesh.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_3:0.0250:his serious reflections on death seem to focus finally, and easily,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_4:0.0250:on its providentially benevolent nature. "It is impossible," he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_10:0.0250:tendency to reflect often on death owes at least as much to the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_14:0.0000:the precise form of traditional meditations on death because a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_15:0.0250:survey of meditations on death which were available in seventeenth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_16:0.0000:century England yields a bewildering variety of texts. As Louis
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_17:0.0000:Martz points out in his study. The Poetry of Meditation , of all /
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_18:0.0250:the forms of meditation spawned by the counter-reformation in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_19:0.0000:England the meditation on death was certainly "the most widely
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_20:0.0250:and intensely cultivated." And, naturally, because the form itself
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_21:0.0250:was so popular, the meditation on death came, in the seventeenth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_22:0.0250:century, to serve many purposes. Some of these meditations were
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_23:0.0250:obviously undertaken as truly mystic exercises, attempts to pierce
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_24:0.0000:now, through death, so as to see, now, as "face to face." Most
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_25:0.0000:meditations, however, were something less exalted; they were exccises,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0122_26:0.0250:as Robert G. Collmer puts it,^^ in "hard, close thought" about
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_2:0.0250:century, "almighty God is wont to teach those that be his."^" Of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_3:0.0000:these latter, less exalted meditations, there are also a wide variety
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_4:0.0000:of types: those which are intended first to cure the natural fear
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_5:0.0000:of death, those which most encourage a true repentance of sin, and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_6:0.0000:those which emphasize a true contempt of the world and a desire for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_7:0.0250:Godliness.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_8:0.0500:But though there is no "typical" meditation on death, there
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_9:0.0000:are certain themes which most such meditations share, more or less,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_10:0.0250:in common. First, although each meditation has its own particular
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_11:0.0000:emphasis, most do at least touch on three related moral topics:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_12:0.0000:they encourage a repentance of sin; they insist that the concerns
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_13:0.0000:of this world are transitory; and they teach men to put their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_14:0.0000:trust in God. Second, many of these meditations share, particularly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_15:0.0000:in their description of the corruption to which man's flesh is heir,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_16:0.0000:a kind of wry irony. This irony or "grim humor," which is fully
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_17:0.0000:documented with examples in Louis Martz' study, can be illustrated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_18:0.0000:V7ith a quotation from what is perhaps the best known group of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_19:0.0000:seventeenth century meditations on death, John Donne's Devotions upon
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_20:0.0250:Emergent Occasions and Several Steps in my Sickness . Donne, describing
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0123_21:0.0000:the dissolution of the body, often turns to jest a topic which might
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_4:0.0500:Finally, of course, these meditations share in common, as already
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_5:0.0000:mentioned, an enormous popularity. Nor was it a popularity which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_6:0.0000:ended with the seventeenth century. Well into the eighteenth century
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_7:0.0000:discourses on death which strongly reflect the meditative tradition
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_8:0.0250:were being composed, and sixteenth and seventeenth century meditations
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_9:0.0000:were being translated and, in many cases, retranslated. As an indi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_10:0.0000:cation of the continuing vitality of the tradition in the eighteenth
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_11:0.0000:century one may note that not only did the playwright Nicolas Rowe
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0124_12:0.0000:aid, in 1709, in the translation of an edition of meditations, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_0:0.0000:vividly imagining, first, the scene of his d.iach and then, in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_2:0.0500:to be following almost exactly the directions for a meditation on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_22:0.0250:of his literary remains , seenis exactly attuned to the writer of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_23:0.0500:meditations on a>iath whose imagination traced, in unbelievable
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_24:0.0500:variety of ways, "the noble dust c; Alexander till he found it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0125_28:0.0500:and that they maie digge for some earthe out of the same
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_5:0.0500:(197-200)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_8:0.0500:with both the topics of the formal meditation on death and with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_9:0.0250:the ironic humor with which the writers of these meditations
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_11:0.0250:But, more importantly, it seems to me, there is a connection
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_13:0.0000:Swift's scattered echoes of them; finally, I think. Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_14:0.0500:poem is written for the same purpose as are these meditations
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_15:0.0500:and, therefore, in something like the same form. Swift's Verses ,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_16:0.0000:that is, like the seventeenth century meditation on death, is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_17:0.0000:involved in the paradoxical and precarious attempt to draw from
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_18:0.0500:death — that ineradicable mark of man's first fall and sinful
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_21:0.0000:(Remember the last things [death, judgment, heaven, hell] and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_22:0.0000:you will never sin). This text from Ecclesiastes was the touch-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_23:0.0000:stone for the whole tradition of meditation on death: in the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_24:0.0250:very fact that man must, soon or late, die to the world lay,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_25:0.0000:for the Christian meditator, the answer how to live well in it.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_26:0.0250:And this same paradoxical vision, it seems to me, informs Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_27:0.0250:poem. Swift's Verses , which begin with La Rochefoucault ' s
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0126_28:0.0000:observation that in the adversity of our friends there is that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0127_6:0.0500:poem's three part structure-- is controlled, though unobtrusively
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0127_8:0.0250:meditation on death: a recognition and repentance of sin, a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0127_10:0.0500:that reliance on God which makes possible charity towards man.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0127_11:0.0250:Beginning with a painfully clear vision of that sinful and worldly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0127_12:0.0500:nature he shares with every man. Swift ends with a demonstration
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_21:0.0000:Certainly, as Kathleen Williams, to whose insighcs I am
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_22:0.0250:frequently indebted in this chapter, has observed, "Pope's sweeping
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_23:0.0250:announcement ,. .has the challenging sound of a piece of deliberate
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_24:0.0000:baiting and Swift's reply is similarly exaggerated...."^^ But,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_25:0.0250:as Williams goes on to point out. Swift's reply, exaggerated as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_26:0.0000:it is, seems also to be "a defense of his [Swift's] own view of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_27:0.0000:man, which has, certainly, something in common with that of La
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_28:0.0000:Rochefoucauit. "27 ^t ^11 events, however seriously we weigh
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_29:0.0000:Swift's reply, it is obvious that in 1725 he seemed unwilling to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_30:0.0250:see Pope undertake a rebuttal of La Rochefoucauld's maxims.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_31:0.0250:Therefore it hardly seems likely that, in 1731, he himself should
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_32:0.0000:pen such a rebuttal. Thus, although Marshall Waingrow's conclusion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_33:0.0250:that the panegyrical close of Swift's Verses constitutes "a direct
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0128_34:0.0500:rebuttal of La Rochefoucauld's maxim" '^^ is a tempting conclusion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_14:0.0250:This assumption that mankind is essentially selfish and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_15:0.0000:profoundly faulted is not, we should begin by remarking, a view
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_16:0.0000:which is incompatible with the traditional Chriscian view of human
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_17:0.0250:nature. La Rochefoucauld himself (although it has been remarked
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_18:0.0000:of his maxims that "so far as God affects his meditations, he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_19:0.0000:might have been an athiest"^^), when he sought an explanation for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_20:0.0250:the abuse of self-love he observed in men, couched that explanation
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0129_28:0.0500:it as his own. Through the last quarter of the seventeenth century
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_2:0.0250:with its insistence on man's faulted condition — met tremendous
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_3:0.0000:philosophical resistance. To men like Shaftesbury, Burnet and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_4:0.0000:Bolingbroke, this doctrine which insisted that man is born,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_5:0.0000:though essentially good, yet with a powerful inclination co
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_6:0.0000:evil, was untenable. To oppose this doctrine Shaftesbury and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_7:0.0000:others proposed one exactly contrary: man is born possessed of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_8:0.0000:instinctive benevolence. And from this doctrir.e the benevolentists
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_9:0.0250:drew, naturally, consequences contrary to La Rochefoucauld's coi-i-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_10:0.0000:ciusion that all human acts, good or evil, spring from his own
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_11:0.0000:self-love. Thus Richard Cumberland comments, in an exact con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_12:0.0000:tradiction of che maxim of La Rochefoucauld which begins Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_13:0.0000:Verses , that "there are in mankind, considered as animal beings
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_14:0.0000:only , propensities of benevolence towards each other. "-*^ And
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_15:0.0250:indeed, for Shaftesbury, to be motivated to a good ace by principles
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_16:0.0500:of self-interest — of honor or of glory, say — was to be vicious.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0130_30:0.0500:more palatable to a benevolentist when he insists not only on the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_10:0.0250:And while Swift argues very gently, in the first paragraphs of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_11:0.0250:Verses , for the validity of chat view of man he is defending — he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_12:0.0000:begins whimsically by asking "Who would not at a crov/ded show,'' Stand
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_13:0.0250:high himself, keep otners low?" (15-16) — ultimately his initial
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_14:0.0000:gentleness only serves co make his final conclusion all the more
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_15:0.0000:crushing. Self-love, Swift asserts, conditions all human relation-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_16:0.0250:ships, even the strongest friendships, by both making them possible
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_17:0.0000:and by limiting their strength.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_18:0.0500:If this conclusion seeiris as unacceptable to us as it was
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_19:0.0000:to many of Swift's contemporaries that is partly because we are,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_20:0.0000:in some vague way, the intellectual inheritors of the benevoientists.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_21:0.0000:But we must nevertheless remember that within the traditionally
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_23:0.0000:without contradiction, to both grant the possibility of real
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_24:0.0000:friendship and yet understand the strongest of friendships to be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_25:0.0000:limited. This is true because the Christian conception of even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_26:0.0000:the strongest friendship is linked indivisibly to self-love:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0131_28:0.0250:and end of the Christian counsel of friendship. And Swift drew
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_3:0.0250:Nature directs every one of us, and God permits
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_5:0.0000:private Good of any other person whatsoever. We
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_6:0.0500:are, indeed, commanded to love our Neighbor as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_9:0.0000:of that love we ought to have towards our neigh-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_11:0.0000:so my neighbor cannot think it hard, if I prefer
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_18:0.0000:But as Swift moves towards this conclusion he is moving,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_19:0.0000:we must realize, in the realm of paradox. To begin with, if as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_20:0.0000:we have already seen, self-love ultimately limits for Swift the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_21:0.0250:strength of the strongest friendship, yet self-love is not, for
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_22:0.0250:Swift, as it is for Shaftesbury, a viciously anti-social force;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_23:0.0000:for self-love also provides the pattern and the reason which makes
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_24:0.0000:"strong friendship" a possibility. Further, for Swift, even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_25:0.0000:the meanest effects of self-love--envy, say, or avarice--bear a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_26:0.0250:perverted testimony to our felt communion with other human
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_27:0.0250:beings. Thus, although in the first forty lines of the Verses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_28:0.0000:Swift insists on showing us that we glory in the misery and are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_29:0.0000:miserable in the glory of other men, he simultaneously shows us
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0132_30:0.0500:that, as Marshall Waingrow observes, "Ironically, what appear to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_8:0.0250:time, all of us, as Swift, who himself confesses having made this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_9:0.0250:observation, knows) is not, of course, being very sociable, but he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_10:0.0000:is being social; he does recognize, though in a clearly perverse way,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_13:0.0000:fects, come to seem, in the proem, not so very different in their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_14:0.0250:generation; they are both self-interested responses to the condition
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_15:0.0250:of other human beings. Indeed, Swift demonstrates how close they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_16:0.0250:are by actually translating, before our eyes, his own envy into mag-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_23:0.0500:Obviously, these lines on Pope (as well as Swift's similar lines on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_24:0.0250:Gay, Arbuthnot and Pultney) are a confession of Swift's envy. Just
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_25:0.0000:as obviously these lines are handsome praise and an act of true mag-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_26:0.0250:nanimity. With this capacity to transform his meanest selfishness
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_27:0.0000:into praise Swift did not need Shaftesbury's assumption that men
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_28:0.0500:possessed a "benevolent impulse" in order to propose a standard of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0133_29:0.0500:moral conduct for men. In fact, for Swift, Shaftesbury's benevolence
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_3:0.0250:But to recognize that Swift's willingness to confess his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_4:0.0000:envy transforms that envy into a generous praise is to raise another
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_5:0.0000:question--how can one account for Swift's willingness to work this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_6:0.0000:transformation? The beginnings of an answer to this question can
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_12:0.0500:These lines are ironic, of course, since the answer to the question
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_13:0.0000:which they pose is necessarily "no." But the reason why it must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_14:0.0000:be "no" informs Swift's magnanimity. Swift himself discusses this i
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_15:0.0250:reason in numerous places, most notably in his sermon On Mutual ( /
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_16:0.0250:Subjection . -^^ In that sermon Swift states clearly the doctrine,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_17:0.0000:only ironically implied by the lines above, that the division of not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_18:0.0000:only talents, power and riches among mankind, but the entire con-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_19:0.0000:dition of each man--his health, wits and all--is granted not by i
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_20:0.0000:chance but by Divine dispensation. From this doctrine Swift, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_21:0.0000:this sermon, draws several conclusions with respect to envy. First,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_22:0.0000:to envy a man who is possessed of apparently greater gifts than
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_23:0.0250:oneself is, in effect, a blasphemous act because it is ultimately
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_24:0.0000:to challenge the wisdom of Heaven. Second, and most important with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_25:0.0000:respect to the lines we are considering, to envy another man is to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_26:0.0250:contradict one's own best self-interest; for if the man envied uses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_27:0.0250:his gifts as he ought (as Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot and Pultney clearly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0134_28:0.0250:have done), then these gifts will manifest themselves as social
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_2:0.0000:"you cannot envy [with any reason] your neighbor's strength if he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_3:0.0250:maketh use of it to defend your life, or carry your burden." And
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_4:0.0250:further if the man envied abuses his talents and uses them viciously
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_8:0.0000:to detest 'em?"--evok.es by implication is an understandable and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_9:0.0000:unmysterious reason for his willingness to transform his own envy
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_10:0.0250:-into magnanimous praise. In che light of his ironic question
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_11:0.0250:Swift's envy appears as a blindly self-interested and hence un-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_12:0.0000:profitable response, while his magnanimity appears as a response
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_13:0.0000:which is not necessarily less self-interested but which is much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_14:0.0250:more finally attuned to conditions fixed by divine dispensation.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_15:0.0500:In fact, it is precisely Swift's ability to see that all the condi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_16:0.0250:tions of life and death are by divine dispensation and ought to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_17:0.0000:serve his own true good which, as we shall see, makes him so fitting
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_18:0.0000:a model for panegyric.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_21:0.0500:first, it is an argument to demonstrate that the motivation for all
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_22:0.0250:our actions and relationships is always self-interest; second, it
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_23:0.0250:shows us that, though we are by nature selfish, we are by our very
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_24:0.0000:selfishness involved in the condition of others; lastly, it obliquely
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_25:0.0500:reminds us that our condition as well as the condition of everyone
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0135_26:0.0500:else is granted by divine dispensation--a fact which, if we are to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_2:0.0000:conditions. The proem, then, is not directly prescriptive, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_3:0.0000:the sum of its arguments do leads to a moral position. That posi-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_4:0.0250:tion is that it is not only permissible (indeed, inevitable) to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_5:0.0000:seek one's own self-interest in one's dealings in this world, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_6:0.0500:it is important to succeed. That one succeed, however, depends
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_8:0.0500:that all things in this world are of God.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_10:0.0250:then, that his friends are willing to seek their own self-interest
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_11:0.0250:in Swift's illness and death; that, as Swift himself has told us,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_12:0.0000:is in accord with nature and permitted by God. The irony is that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_13:0.0000:they are unable to find their self-interest. For, if in the pros-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_14:0.0000:perity of our friends our own self-interest leads us to assert our
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_15:0.0000:commonality with them then the same lesson should be, if anything,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_16:0.0250:more clear in our friends' adversities. Donne in his Devotions
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_17:0.0500:makes this point in a way which illuminates the misguided responses
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_20:0.0500:ourselves that we might very well have been that man;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_21:0.0250:why might not I have been that man that is carried to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_22:0.0000:his grave now? Could I fit myself to stand or sit in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_23:0.0000:any man's place, and not to lie in any man's grave: I
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_24:0.0000:may lack much of the good parts of the meanest, but I
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_25:0.0250:lack nothing of the mortality of the weakest; they may
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_26:0.0000:have acquired better abilities that' I, but I was born
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0136_34:0.0500:J
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_12:0.0500:In this failure Swift's friends seem, one must say, re-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_13:0.0250:markably obtuse, for Swift has imagined his own death in such way
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_14:0.0250:as to make its universally fatal implications extremely clear.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_15:0.0000:When the Dean's knell is tolled it immediately involves whole com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_16:0.0000:munities. The news runs through Dublin, begets a race of elegies,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_17:0.0000:spreads to London, invades the court, is told at Chartres, inspires
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_18:0.0000:activity at Curl's, reaches out to Twickenham, and lastly filters
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_19:0.0000:through a female card party. The spreading of the news itself
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_20:0.0000:becomes emblematic: no human scene, it is clear, is completely
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_21:0.0250:exempt from a passing-bell. Further, the commonality of death is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_22:0.0000:what Swift emphasizes in the way he imagines his own, for the Dean
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_23:0.0000:dies of no unique disease; his death is, rather, in accord with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_24:0.0000:"the course of nature" to which all men must submit. Therefore, _-'
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_25:0.0000:and here Swift puts a very fine point on the commonality of death,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_26:0.0500:a neighbor can be readily imagined who might "feel a Pain,/ Just in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0137_27:0.0500:the Parts, where I complain." (135-36).
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0138_8:0.0500:(139-140)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_9:0.0250:reminder of their own, and thus as a warning to be mindful of ulti-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_10:0.0250:mate values, that most of Swift's friends desert, not Swift, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_11:0.0000:their own self-interest and thus become pare of that group which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_12:0.0250:has always been the object of satire--the group of men who, not
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_13:0.0500:not knowing themselves, do not know their own good.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_15:0.0000:his friends' varied responses to his death. Between those who amuse
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_16:0.0000:themselves by predicting the day of Swift's death and, say. Pope,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_17:0.0000:who truly mourns Swift for a full month, there is a world of dif-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_18:0.0250:ference. The former fail both in compassion and comprehension.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_19:0.0500:They fall to numbering the days remaining to Swift's life when, in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_20:0.0000:fact, the event of Swift's death should teach them to number their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_21:0.0000:own days. That is why they are subject to Swift's satire. There
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_22:0.0250:is, on the other hand, as we have already seen, a high compliment
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_23:0.0250:for Pope in Swift's compassionate recognition that "Poor Pope will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_24:0.0000:mourn a month. ..." But, as different as are these two imagined
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_25:0.0250:responses to Swift's death, they share one thing in common: they
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_26:0.0000:both can remind Swift (and us) of that which most of his friends
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_27:0.0000:have forgotten, "how transitory are all things below."-* Thus, even
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_28:0.0000:while Swift, in imagining that Pope will mourn a full mor.th is ob-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0139_29:0.0250:liquely complimenting him, his compliment itself only more strongly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_6:0.0250:Indeed, the transience of men and things is, it seems to me,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_7:0.0000:the whole burden of lines 243-2S9, the concluding lines of the second
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_8:0.0000:section. Earlier in this section, we will remember. Swift imagines
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_9:0.0000:that his literary remains will pass through tne soiling grasp of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_10:0.0000:Tibbalds, Moore, and Gibber. But it is only in the last fifty lines
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_11:0.0000:of this section that we learn how extensive Swift imagines their
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_12:0.0000:triumph to be. It is the works of these men, who stand for so much
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_13:0.0000:Swift hated, that he imagines filling the bookshops. Indeed, as
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_14:0.0000:Swift imagines it, a short year after his death will see Walpole
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_15:0.0000:find a vindication, and Henley an audience, and Woolston, who showed
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0140_16:0.0000:"That Jesus was a grand Imposter," a pension and perhaps a mitre.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_2:0.0000:of an "indif ferenc" narrator, is in one sensv^, very abrupt. In an-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_3:0.0000:other sense, how>2ver, the transition has been prepared for by the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_4:0.0000:whole logic of the poem. The great fictional device of this poem
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_5:0.0250:has been, from its title on, that Swift is first dying and then dead.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_6:0.0000:It is written throughout from the point of view of a man who has
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_7:0.0000:nothing either to hope or fear from the world; it is written, that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_8:0.0000:is, from the "indifferent" point of view of Swift's panegyrist. 1
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_9:0.0250:Swift has been able to freely assure us that the single motivation
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_10:0.0000:of his life has been self-inuerest, and he has confessed easily
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_11:0.0250:enough instances in his life v/here that self-interest was excessive.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_12:0.0000:But he has also arrived ac that point where he can hardly confound
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_13:0.0000:his true self-interest wich any worldly good--rather, from the dis-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_14:0.0000:solution of his own flesh, as any seventeenth century meditation on
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_16:0.0500:\
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_19:0.0500:that the only true good of man is trust in God. And thac, I will argue,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_21:0.0250:Yet Swift's panegyric is neither overtly an adjuration to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_22:0.0000:us to trust in God nor an overt profession of Sx';ift's own faith.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_23:0.0000:On the face of it the panegyric is simply a list of the good Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_24:0.0000:has done his fellow man (i.e., defeated Wood's half pence, left
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_25:0.0000:money to build an asylum) and of the adversities under which he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_26:0.0000:did chis good (i.e., he was exiled to Ireland i:i\d a price was put
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_27:0.0000:on his head). But the language Swift uses to aescribe both the good
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_28:0.0000:he has done and the adversities he has faced is a very highly allu-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0141_29:0.0250:sive language--and its allusions are most'.y to Scripture. Thus,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_2:0.0500:conflict with a judge "who long all justice had discarded/ Nor
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_3:0.0000:feared he GOD, nor man regarded ," he has done more than simply
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_4:0.0000:indicate that this judge was a very wicked fellow; he has indicated
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_5:0.0000:too that his own cause was, in some way, regardful of both man and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_6:0.0000:God. By this process of allusion, often repeated, Swift, without
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_7:0.0250:ever openly saying so, sutures his good works to his faith.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_8:0.0250:Swift's allusive method does obviously complicate the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_9:0.0000:job of rendering a creditable explication of his panegyric, but
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_10:0.0000:it is, certainly, a method entirely in keeping with his own life.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_11:0.0000:For although we, having Swift's private writings and his corres-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_12:0.0000:pondence, have no reason to doubt the Dean's faith, yet in his life
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_13:0.0000:so strictly did Swift adhere to Christ's adjuration to be privately
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_14:0.0250:pious (lest through public piety one fall into pride) that many of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_15:0.0250:his contemporaries, while praising the Dean's work, doubted his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_16:0.0000:faith. His panegyric, therefore, in submerging its references
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_17:0.0250:to his faith within its descriptions of his works, more exactly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_20:0.0000:that in the panegyric Swift's good works both reflect and are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_21:0.0000:dependent upon his trust in God. His graceful transformation of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_22:0.0000:envy to magnanimity (which we examined in the proem) was rendered
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_23:0.0000:rationally explicable, we will remember, by those lines in which
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_24:0.0000:he obliquely reminded us that the gifts of his friends had been
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_25:0.0000:assigned them by heaven. In a very similar way, both before the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0142_26:0.0250:panegyric and in it, his allusions to portions of Scripture
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_4:0.0250:In the second section of the poem we learn, not that Swift has en-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_5:0.0000:dowed an insane asylum, but only that he has left his money to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_6:0.0250:public uses, and, as Waingrovj has pointed out, we can see Swift's
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_15:0.0250:Swift, that is, unlike the anonymous public speaker of these
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_16:0.0250:lines, makes clear by his willingness to do strangers good that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_17:0.0000:he recognizes an obligation which extends beyond friends and kin,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_18:0.0000:recognizes that, to employ again Donne's phrases, "all mankind is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_19:0.0250:of one author, and is one volume, "^^ and that, therefore, he is
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_20:0.0250:involved in it and has obligations to it. But here we must be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_21:0.0000:extremely careful not to translate Swift's willingness to do
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_22:0.0250:strangers good into an act motivated by a soft-headed "benevolence
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_23:0.0000:towards the species," for to do that would be to undermine the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_24:0.0250:whole import of Swift's proem. Nor is it at all necessary to do
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_25:0.0000:that, because to discover Swift's motive one need look no further
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_26:0.0000:than the Book of Psalms . The Psalter affirms in a variety of ways
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_27:0.0000:and places that "both the rich and the poor shall die and leave
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0143_28:0.0500:their money unto strangers, "^^ a point the logic of which, given
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_3:0.0000:must. But the key vjord here, of course, is willingly. Swift,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_4:0.0000:recognizing that the way of this world is such that he must leave
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_5:0.0000:his money to strangers, acquiesces; choosing to align his will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_6:0.0000:(in both senses) with the way of this world and presumably with
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_7:0.0250:Him Whose will controls this world, he acts charitably.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_8:0.0500:It is just this sort of clearsightedness about what things
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_9:0.0000:are transitory, what permanent, which distinguishes those good
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_10:0.0000:works of Swift which are praised in the panegyric. The panegyric
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_11:0.0000:begins with a brief defense of Swift's satire, to which topic we
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_12:0.0000:vjill return at the close of this study. Immediately after this
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_13:0.0000:defense we are plunged into those lines of the panegyric which are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0144_14:0.0250:so often cited as exemplary of Swift's overweening pride. Swift
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_2:0.0250:Book of Jucie . Jude, having charged an unidentified group of heretics
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_3:0.0000:with inverting all religious values, ends his charge vjith the asser-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_4:0.0000:tion that while these heretics disregarded God, they "persons had
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_5:0.0000:in admiration." ■■'■ Swift's claim, therefore, that he was such a
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_6:0.0250:man as did not have "persons in admiration" at least suggests, by
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_7:0.0250:reference to Jude, vjhat Swift did have "in admiration." As he
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_17:0.0250:occasionally he does, by allusion, tell us what he trusts. Let
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_25:0.0000:of self-satire, but, I think we shall see, this claim Swift made
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_26:0.0000:in absolute earnest. In order to understand this claim we must
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_27:0.0000:first understand Swift's use of the word "liberty." And that use,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0145_28:0.0500:in turn depends, I believe, on the lines which begin the verse
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0146_28:0.0500:should be understood as a praise of Swift's stoic fortitude in
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0146_29:0.0250:the face of adversities, but rather as a praise of Swift's ability,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_3:0.0500:friendship. The coldness of most of Sv;ift's friends at his death
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_4:0.0000:plays a prominent part in the second section of the Verses and
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_5:0.0000:Swift returns to the ultimately undependable nature of human
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_13:0.0500:perhaps, than it might most men, but, nevertheless, the terms
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_14:0.0000:in which he expresses this betrayal indicate that he knew hov; to
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_15:0.0250:find his own true self-interest even in this most painful form of
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_16:0.0500:adversity. For the italicized sections of this quotation are
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0147_23:0.0500:The psalm begins with a statement of faith: the Lord will
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_8:0.0250:The similarity between these friends of the narrator (who actually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_9:0.0250:"devise his hurt") and Swift's friends who, if they do not actually
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_10:0.0000:devise his hurt, anticipate his death with unseemly indifference
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_11:0.0000:is, I think, obvious. Swift himself acknowledges the similarity
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_12:0.0000:by forming, as we have seen above, his own complaint out of the
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_13:0.0250:words of the psalm. But the relevance, for us, of the intersection
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_14:0.0000:of Swift's Verses with Psalm 41, lies in the conclusion of that
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_15:0.0250:psalm, a conclusion which both is, and is not, like the conclusion
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_22:0.0250:refuge is the Lord. But the narrator--who is an Old Testament
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_23:0.0000:narrator--can conceive of God's graciousness manifesting itself
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_24:0.0250:towards him only by permitting him to recover his full earthly
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_25:0.0000:power. Swift, on the other hand, recognizes that it may also be
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_26:0.0250:a mark of grace to die in charity ^jith those who have sinned
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0148_27:0.0500:against one. It is this good which he draws from those who have
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_7:0.0250:Over and over the lesson is repeated as Swift, in the pane-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_8:0.0250:gyric, draws from all the adversities of his life-- the political
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_11:0.0250:good, not only for him, but, because it is founded on his trust
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_12:0.0000:in God's way with man, a good for all the members of God's com-
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_13:0.0000:munity. Even out of the flaws of his own character Swift can draw
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_14:0.0000:good. The Dean, he admits, "Had too much Satyr in his Vein" (456)
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_15:0.0250:and, others might add, too much vanity as well. But from his
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0149_21:0.0500:And from a combination of satire and vanity he drew no less a

poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_5:0.0000:He is pre-eminently the poet of the German people.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_6:0.0000:No poet embodies more fiilly the spirit, the charac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_7:0.0250:teristic traits of his nation, than Uhland. However
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_8:0.0500:wide his studies in related literatures, his culture is
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_9:0.0000:thoroughly Germanic. Certain of his poems are uni-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_10:0.0250:versal in their appeal to all hearts. Possibly no Ger-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_11:0.0500:man poet, whose writings are of equal extent, has at-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_12:0.0000:tracted so many translators. As a poet representing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_13:0.0250:so fully the national spirit, his works are worthy of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_15:0.0500:duction to the study of folk-songs and mediaeval German
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_16:0.0250:legends. It is impossible to study the poet Uhland,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_17:0.0250:whose life was so occupied with public affairs, without
poemsuhland00friegoog_0012_18:0.0500:constant references to his personal history.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_0:0.0500:BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_1:0.0250:Johann Ludwig Uhland, or, as he preferred to write his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_2:0.0250:name, simply Ludwig Uhland, was bom in Tübingen on the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_3:0.0000:26th day of Apru, 1787. His father, Johann Friedrich, was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_4:0.0000:secretary of the University of Tübingen. The family of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_5:0.0000:Uhland's father can be traced for a century and a half
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_6:0.0000:before his birth. It is of plain citizen rank when we
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_7:0.0250:know it first. The carpenter Jakob Ulandt, with his wife
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_8:0.0000:Agnes, resided in the hamlet of Zebedäi, not far from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_9:0.0000:Hattenhofen. They are characterized in the church reg-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_10:0.0000:ister as " impious despisers of the Word and the Sacra-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_11:0.0000:ments." Similar words were used in our country during
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_12:0.0000:the strict ecclesiasticism of its early days, of any who did
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_13:0.0000:not adhere to the established church or observe its ordi-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_14:0.0000:nances. A son of this carpenter Jakob, John Michael, of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_15:0.0000:the village of Hattenhofen, in the district of which Göp-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_16:0.0000:pingen is the chief town, fought at Belgrade, where he slew
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_17:0.0000:a Turkish pasha. Later he became a quartermaster in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_18:0.0000:mounted body-guard of his sovereign, Duke Eberhard
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_19:0.0000:Ludwig, and settled in the village of Klein-Gartach near
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_20:0.0250:Heilbronn, where, above a door of his house, arms carved
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_21:0.0000:in stone, representing a man with a Turkish sabre in one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_22:0.0250:hand and a spade in the other, with the initials of his name,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0020_23:0.0500:were preserved as late as 1830. The name of the family
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_4:0.0500:A son of the soldier Joseph Uhland established himself
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_5:0.0250:in Tübingen, where he learned the business of a merchant,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_6:0.0000:and was admitted as a citizen in 1720. Of the two sons of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_7:0.0000:the latter, one succeeded him in a business which still ex-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_8:0.0000:ists, while the other, Ludwig Joseph, studied divinity, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_9:0.0000:became a professor of history, and later of theology, in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_10:0.0000:university, and superintendent of the evangelical seminary.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_11:0.0250:On the strict division of trades and the rigid distinction of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_12:0.0000:rank, it was only through education that the sons of the citizen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_13:0.0000:or tradesman's class attained a higher social position. Few
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_14:0.0000:countries exhibit the influence of an established church as so
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_15:0.0000:dominant a social and even political force as Wilrtemberg.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_16:0.0000:The clerical estate constituted a part of the single chamber of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_17:0.0000:the parliament. The four prelates of the former Catholic mo-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_18:0.0000:nastic establishments occupied seats among the lords. As
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_19:0.0000:in civil life, so in the church, positions were largely heredi-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_21:0.0000:leading ofHces in the church, and enjoyed the emoluments
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_22:0.0000:and dignities which such offices conferred. Education and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_23:0.0000:admission to clerical orders gave at once social dignity and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_24:0.0000:prestige, and, when united with commanding talents, lifted
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_25:0.0000:those who possessed them into positions of influence. Thus
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_26:0.0250:the plain family of Uhland attained social rank in the uni-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_27:0.0000:versity town and in the state. The poet's grandfather, Ludwig
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_28:0.0000:Joseph, enjoyed the respect of the community, and lived to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_29:0.0000:reach the age of eighty years, and to confirm his grandson
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_30:0.0000:when the latter reached the age of fourteen. The wife of this
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_31:0.0000:worthy man was Gottliebin Standelin, a member of a family
poemsuhland00friegoog_0021_32:0.0250:of which several members possessed poetic gifts, one of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_4:0.0000:sided as a curate in Marbach early in his theological career
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_8:0.0000:The second son of the theologian, Johann Friedrich (bom
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_9:0.0250:1756), the father of our poet, studied law in the university,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_10:0.0000:but accepted the uneventful, if comfortable, position of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_11:0.0000:secretary of the university, which had been held by his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_12:0.0000:father-in-law, Jacob Samuel Hoser. He married the latter's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_13:0.0000:daughter Elizabeth in 1 783. The family of Uhland's mother
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_14:0.0000:originated in the imperial city of Augsburg, where three
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_15:0.0000:members of it had held the honorable position of burgo-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_16:0.0000:master. While the poet's grandfather wrote devout poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_17:0.0000:for family anniversaries, which are preserved, and his elder
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_18:0.0000:son Ludwig Gottlieb, who died as a tutor in a German family
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_19:0.0000:in Venice in 1777, left poems which, while not memorable,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_20:0.0000:show likeness to those of his nephew, the poet is supposed to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_21:0.0250:have inherited his poetic gifts from his mother, who possessed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_23:0.0500:wise.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_25:0.0500:ofHcial, not without a formal cast of character derived from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_26:0.0250:his profession. He was simple in nature, but inflexible in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0022_27:0.0000:honor and duty, traits which descended to his son, and con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_1:0.0250:Ludwig Uhland, called "Louis" in his boyhood and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_3:0.0000:Frederick, having died in his tenth year. To his only sister,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_4:0.0250:Louise, who was eight years his junior, he was tenderly de-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_5:0.0250:voted. The young Uhland was bold and fond of adventure.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_6:0.0000:He was passionately devoted to outdoor exercise, a quality
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_7:0.0000:which followed him throughout his life. He enjoyed swim-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_8:0.0500:ming, skating, and long walks and mountain climbs. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_9:0.0500:region in which he lived was picturesque, now presenting
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_10:0.0000:wooded peaks, ruins of castles full of historical interest, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_11:0.0000:now cold and gray ridges which glowed in the light of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_12:0.0000:setting sun. The ruins of the castles of HohenzoUern and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_13:0.0000:Hohenstauffen, famous for the mighty dynasties which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_14:0.0000:sprang from them, were not far away. Everything was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_15:0.0000:suited to awaken the romantic element in the boy's nature.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_16:0.0250:Through the valley before the city ran the highway over
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_17:0.0000:which the armies of the German emperors had marched to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_18:0.0250:new dominions in Italy. The town of Tübingen itself was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_19:0.0000:the former capital of the county. It is situated on the slope
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_20:0.0000:of a hill, and is surmounted by the castle of the Dukes of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_21:0.0250:Würtemberg, now containing the library of the university
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_22:0.0000:and the offices of administration. The castle has withstood
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_23:0.0250:many a siege, and is famous in song and story. The town
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_24:0.0000:itself is a dull, uninteresting village, enlivened only by the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_25:0.0000:life of the famous university forwarded by Eberhard.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_26:0.0000:Uhland's first studies were pursued in the Latin school,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_27:0.0000:where his energy and devotion to study soon put him first in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_28:0.0000:his class. The Latin school included at this time about one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_29:0.0250:hundred and thirty or forty pupils. It had been greatly
poemsuhland00friegoog_0023_32:0.0250:of 1793 prescribed among the subjects of instruction the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_2:0.0000:tory, geography and natural history. At the age of twelve
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_3:0.0000:Ludwig had reached the highest class, and was under the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_4:0.0000:immediate instruction of Rector Kaufifmann, Hutten's sue-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_5:0.0250:cessor, — an excellent classical teacher, who promoted ath-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_6:0.0000:letic exercises among the scholars. This teacher studied
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_7:0.0000:the individuality of his pupils, and allowed them to write
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_8:0.0000:their required verses in German or in Latin. Uhland wrote
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_9:0.0000:Latin verse with great ease.* Many of the German poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_10:0.0000:of his youthful years, and also some of his Latin ones, are
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_11:0.0000:preserved.! The boy also possessed great skill in drawing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_12:0.0500:and in painting in water-colors.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_14:0.0000:to write a poem embodying the request of the pupils for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_15:0.0000:usual spring vacation, and present the same to the dean.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_16:0.0000:Uhland was chosen to perform this duty. A second poem,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_17:0.0250:slightly later (May 3, 1801), is religious in tone, upon the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_18:0.0000:Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, and was suggested by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_19:0.0000:the serious thoughts connected with his preparation for con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_20:0.0500:firmation.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_21:0.0250:The lad had an early passion for tales of adventure, of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_22:0.0250:knights and heroes; and in the house of his maternal grand-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_23:0.0250:father, the former secretary of the university, there was a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_24:0.0500:room filled with " old books and chronicles with wonderful
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_25:0.0250:pictures, descriptions of travel in lands where the inhabitants
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_26:0.0000:had but one eye, placed in the centre of the forehead, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0024_27:0.0250:where there were men with horses* feet and cranes* necks,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_10:0.0500:Parliament at Frankfort, he took part in the delibera-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_11:0.0500:tions on the proposed reorganization of Germany, and fought
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_15:0.0500:miles away. This was under Austrian supremacy, and here
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_16:0.0250:the boy saw the strange uniforms and heard the strange lan-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_17:0.0250:guages of the Croats and Hungarians of the garrison. There,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_18:0.0000:too, he saw the brilliant processions of Corpus Christi day, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_19:0.0000:survival of that mediaeval life which had so strange an attrac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_20:0.0000:tion for him, and which colored the character of his poetry.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_21:0.0250:He read, with a companion, the thrilling romances of chivalry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_22:0.0000:of Spiess and Ritter. Whether standing on the hights of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_23:0.0250:Osterberg, with the towers of the castle of the Dukes of Tü-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_24:0.0250:bingen beneath him, or looking away to Lichtenstein, he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0025_25:0.0500:was in a land of legend and chivalric deeds, every spot of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_4:0.0250:The founder of the scholarship had expressly excluded all
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_5:0.0000:students of medicine from its benefits, because physicians
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_6:0.0000:had been unable to cure him of a severe malady. It had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_7:0.0250:been the purpose of the parents that their son should study
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_8:0.0000:medicine, and succeed his uncle. Gotthold Uhland, who en-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_9:0.0000:joyed a large practice in Tübingen. He had acquiesced in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_10:0.0000:this decision, which seemed to promise most for his im-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_11:0.0000:mediate future, though he would have preferred the study of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_12:0.0000:philology. His father left the decision to the youth of four-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_13:0.0000:teen years, but suggested that if he chose the study of juris-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_14:0.0000:prudence, he himself would reserve for him a sum equal to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_15:0.0000:stipend for future travel. On the 3d of October, 1801, Uhland
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_16:0.0250:was therefore enrolled as a student of law in the university
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_17:0.0000:of his native town. The admission of students to the uni-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_18:0.0000:versity at this early age was not at that time unusual. As
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_19:0.0000:the school system was at that time arranged, the course of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_20:0.0000:study in the Latin school extended only to the fourteenth
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_21:0.0250:year. Additional preparation for the university was secured
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_22:0.0000:after admission by private instruction, usually from the tu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_23:0.0000:tors of the evangelical seminary. Additional instruction was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_24:0.0000:required in the ancient languages, and often in political and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_25:0.0250:literary history, natural science and mathematics.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_26:0.0000:Uhland's teacher was the tutor (^Repeteni) Seufert, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_27:0.0000:afterward occupied the dignified position of prelate in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_28:0.0000:church of Wiirtemberg. His love of literature found occu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_29:0.0000:pation outside the regular hours of instruction, and, in con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_30:0.0000:nection with his friend Gmelin, he read repeatedly the Odys-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0026_31:0.0500:sey and the Greek tragedians, especially Sophocles, in sum-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_0:0.0500:XX BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_1:0.0500:Uhland says, "I enjoyed composing New Year's poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_2:0.0000:in Horatian verse for my grandfather. I was, in general, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_3:0.0000:family poet. I wrote birthday congratulations for the daugh-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_4:0.0250:ters of my uncle, the doctor. . . . About this time I found at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_5:0.0000:the house of Professor {sic Advocate) Weisse, a kinsman,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_6:0.0500:in a periodical entitled the Heidelberg Museum^ songs
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_7:0.0250:from the Heldenbuch^ of which the song of Old Htldebrand
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_8:0.0000:made a deep impression upon me." The most eminent of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_9:0.0000:Uhland's teachers was Professor Bohnenberger, the mathe-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_10:0.0250:matician, but the young student had little taste or natural
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_11:0.0000:gifts for this subject. The library of Rosier, the professor
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_12:0.0000:of history, whose method of instruction, however, did not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_13:0.0000:please him, afforded him books of the greatest interest
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_14:0.0000:and directed his studies into the field of mediaeval Germanic
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_15:0.0250:literature. " How happy was I when I could carry home
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_16:0.0000:SaxO'Grammaticus in Müller's translation, or i^it Helden-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_17:0.0250:sage; from the latter work I derived my fondness for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_18:0.0000:northern myths. From the; Heldensage I took the subject
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_20:0.0000:A lecture by Professor Rosier, in which he compared the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_21:0.0000:Odyssey, Ossian, and the Latin poem of Walther of Aqui-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_22:0.0000:taine, seems to have inspired the young student, and awak-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_23:0.0000:ened a passion for early German literature which was to be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_24:0.0000:the supreme direction of his life. He hastened to his teach-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_25:0.0250:er's house in order to borrow the book whose story had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_26:0.0000:moved him so deeply. The finely illustrated Heldenbuch
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_27:0.0000:which he acquired by purchase, July 30, 1805, is probably
poemsuhland00friegoog_0027_28:0.0500:the same volume as that recently presented to the university
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_2:0.0250:in spite of my zealous perusal, could not afford, because they
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_3:0.0000:were too clear, too finished, — that which I missed in more
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_4:0.0500:modern poetry with all its rhetorical ornamentation, I found
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_5:0.0000:here; fresh pictures and forms with a deep background
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_6:0.0000:occupied and entranced the imagination.'' He even began
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_7:0.0000:to copy the book which contained this wonderful poem.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_8:0.0000:About this time Professor Conz was appointed professor of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_9:0.0000:German literature in the university. Although not capable
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_10:0.0000:of guiding the young student in the field which had awak-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_11:0.0000:ened his enthusiasm as nothing before, he had a kindly in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_12:0.0000:terest in Uhland, and a Stylisticum which he held was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_13:0.0000:attended with profit, and imitated in a similar rhetorical
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_15:0.0000:professorship in the university.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_16:0.0000:The early years of Uhland in the university were rather
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_17:0.0250:preparatory than distinctively in the direction of study for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_18:0.0000:his degree. Mention is made in the university records of a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_19:0.0250:course of three and a half years in jurisprudence, extending
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_20:0.0000:from the autumn of 1804 to the spring of 1808. He pur-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_21:0.0250:sued history, the classics, and upon the appearance of Des
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_22:0.0250:Knaben Wunderkorn (1805), he felt the marvelous charm
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_23:0.0250:which that book exerted upon so many, and directed his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_24:0.0000:attention to folk-songs. He studied Herder's collection,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_26:0.0500:and Scotch ballads in Percy's Reliques of Ancient English
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_27:0.0000:Poetry^ selections from which had appeared nearly a half
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_28:0.0000:century before. He studied French, English and Spanish
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_29:0.0000:in part by himself, as well as the literature of the North, in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0028_30:0.0250:order to understand how the popular life of different nations
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_2:0.0000:thus bolated in a degree from the joyous and tumultuous
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_3:0.0500:life of the student world. He did not share its ruder pleas-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_4:0.0250:ures, nor participate in its license. A silence and reserve
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_5:0.0000:of temperament kept him aloof from the multitude. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_6:0.0000:never had an ambition for mere popularity. In circles with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_7:0.0500:which he was familiar, and with friends whose confidence he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_8:0.0250:shared, he communicated himself freely. He participated
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_10:0.0250:Numerous poems were preserved by him from these early
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_11:0.0000:academic years, and several are included in his poetical
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_12:0.0500:works. Among these are Der blinde König (Aug. 23-24,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_13:0.0000:1804) and Die sterbenden Helden (July 14, 1804). In the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_14:0.0250:years 1 803-1 805 his life entered a wider stadium, as regards
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_15:0.0000:poetical production. This activity was due to the influence
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_16:0.0000:and encouragement of a group of friends who were studying
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_17:0.0000:at Tübingen during this time, among whom were several of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_18:0.0000:the most cherished friends of his life : Justinus Kerner, Karl
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_19:0.0000:Mayer, Heinrich KÖstlin, Georg Jäger, and Karl Roser,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_20:0.0000:who became his brother-in-law, and later J. F. Harprecht
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_21:0.0250:Of these he had previously known Kerner, and this friend
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_22:0.0500:drew him from his retirement into a delightful life of social
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_23:0.0000:intercourse and literary sympathy.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_24:0.0500:Of Uhland's youthful poems, from his fourteenth to his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_25:0.0250:eighteenth year, there are preserved a pocket-book neatly
poemsuhland00friegoog_0029_26:0.0500:written, containing poems and plans of poems from the years
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_3:0.0000:Many of these were occasional poems written for some
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_4:0.0000:birthday festival, others are moral in character, in praise of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_5:0.0000:virtue, as those upon " Friendship," " The Reward of Vir-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_6:0.0000:tue," etc.; others are reverent and devout, often on Bible
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_7:0.0000:themes, in which the influence of the serious hours of his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_8:0.0000:preparation for confirmation, and possibly of his reading of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_9:0.0000:Klopstock, can be traced, as " Simeon," " Jesus' Death upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_10:0.0000:the Cross," "The Resurrection and Ascension." Other
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_11:0.0250:poems were school exercises or inspired by his studies; thus
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_12:0.0250:we find "The Choice of Scipio " {Scipios Wahl), " Marius
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_13:0.0000:on the Ruins of Carthage " (^Marius auf Karthagos Trüm-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_14:0.0250:mern) ; others were written in praise of nature, which may
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_15:0.0000:have been school exercises or based upon his reading;
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_16:0.0000:others are distinct echoes of German heroic song, inspired
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_17:0.0000:by his admiration for his country's history or upon Norse
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_18:0.0000:legends. Thus we have sketches of poems upon Alboin
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_19:0.0000:and Kunimund, from the narratives in Paulus Diaconus,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_20:0.0250:" Helgo and Starkater " was evidently intended to contain a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_21:0.0000:heroic contest, banqueting, a noble sacrifice for friendship, etc.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_22:0.0500:In many of these poems there are unmistakable traces of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_25:0.0250:youthful poems, together with specimens which had only been in part
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_26:0.0000:published from the three periods, 1800-1802, 1803 and 1804, and 1805, also
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_27:0.0000:valuable tables giving the original titles, first lines, date of origin and of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0030_28:0.0500:publication, and varying reading^ of numerous poems. Not all of Uh-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_1:0.0250:contemporary writers, as of Goethe, in certain lines of " Helgo
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_2:0.0000:and Starkater," of Schiller in Die vier Jahreszeiten^ and in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_3:0.0000:other poems also, and of Bürger. There are occasional poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_4:0.0000:written when the mind of the youth was growing into inde-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_5:0.0000:pendence, when his emotions are genuine, not imitated in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_6:0.0000:expression from his poetic models; but as a whole these
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_7:0.0000:poems show, as might have been expected in a youth of this
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_8:0.0000:age, only suggestions of the direction of his future power.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_9:0.0000:They exhibit great facility in poetic form, and occasionally,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_10:0.0250:in content, a genuine and spontaneous expression of duty,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_11:0.0000:fidelity to conviction, freedom from imitation of others, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_12:0.0000:noble independence, qualities which existed in Uhland and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_13:0.0000:found early expression in his verse. There was little that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_14:0.0000:was characteristic of his future power, but numerous minor
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_15:0.0250:qualities which indicated an individuality not at that time
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_16:0.0000:pronounced, and a delicate poetic sensibility. He also at-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_17:0.0000:tempted ballads and a Romanze^ stanzas of a ballad which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_18:0.0000:later grew into Der blinde Könige in Das Lied vom armen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_20:0.0500:these were not, as is often the case, school themes, as Bur-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0031_21:0.0500:gerkrieg. The form of Vaterlandsliebe suggests the same.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_1:0.0250:maiden listens to the murmur of the wind and the ocean for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_2:0.0000:tidings, and answers sadly with her harp. The hero will in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_3:0.0000:death remember his beloved, and she will follow him in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_4:0.0250:death. In The Bride the lover comes to the wedding
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_5:0.0250:through festal throngs, and finds his bride dead upon her
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_6:0.0000:couch. He bids the bridal song be sung, and casts a neck-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_7:0.0000:lace and bracelets around the neck and arms of his bride,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_8:0.0000:and places a ribbon in her blonde hair, and falls upon his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_9:0.0000:sword with a smile in death. In the Sorceress the form of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_10:0.0000:the dead prince Biorn is summoned at the request of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_11:0.0000:maiden; as she embraces her lover, he vanishes and she
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_12:0.0000:falls dead. The witch ascends the tower, and listens to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_13:0.0000:music of the stars in their everlasting course, and cries,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_14:0.0000:"Who is in that garment of cloud, who in the morning
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_15:0.0000:glow? I greet you, ye sainted ones, in blissful reunion. So
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_16:0.0000:journey to the House of Light, and live and love anew.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_17:0.0250:The love and fidelity of the gods is their everlasting rapture."
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_18:0.0000:In the musical Elfenklufl the sailor who has lost his beloved
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_19:0.0000:steers along the shore where the elves dance in a cleft; he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_20:0.0000:is caught up and borne along by the spirit-choir in which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_21:0.0250:was his beloved. While we find no striking imaginative
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_23:0.0250:pressed, and superior poetic form.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_24:0.0250:A genuine feeling for nature is manifested in some of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_25:0.0000:poems of this year, as in Die Berge, describing the Swabian
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_26:0.0000:Alb and the castle of Lichtenstein. The " Warder's Song '*
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_27:0.0000:(J)as Lied eines Hochwächters) suggests an earlier form of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_28:0.0000:Des Knaben Berglied, Uhland's occasional poems, written
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_29:0.0000:to commemorate the new year or the birthdays of his parents
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_30:0.0000:or grandfather, are grateful recognitions of love and care,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_31:0.0500:and express a noble boyish resolve to be worthy of their
poemsuhland00friegoog_0032_32:0.0000:teaching. In the Latin poem to his grandfather, Superin-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_1:0.0500:tendent Uhland, written just before the latter's death (May,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_2:0.0250:1803), he praises his noble achievements as a historian in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_3:0.0000:rescuing the forms of the nation's heroes from forgetfulness.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_4:0.0250:The range of his sentiment in his poems to nature is limited;
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_5:0.0250:they are pensive, interpreting her graver moods in autumn
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_6:0.0000:falling leaf, and the love and tenderness in the young poet's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_7:0.0000:works dissolve in tears. None of these early poems show
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_8:0.0000:great strength, or lead one to expect unusual promise. They
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_9:0.0000:are rather the prodiict of a youth of poetic sensibility, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_10:0.0250:possesses a conventional feeling and power of interpreting
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_11:0.0250:nature, and an unusual mastery of smooth verse, adorned
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_12:0.0000:with graceful but not unfamiliar images. In the field in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_13:0.0000:which Uhland is unquestioned master, and where his reputa-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_14:0.0000:tion so largely rests, that of ballads and poetical romances,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_15:0.0250:as shown by his Hermann und Utha (Feb., 1803) and his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_18:0.0000:influence of Bürger.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_19:0.0250:The year 1805 was a year of great and successful poetical
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_20:0.0000:activity. On October lo of that year he drew up a list of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_21:0.0000:thirty poems to which he seems to have attached especial
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_22:0.0500:value. Of these, one is preserved from the year 1803, six
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_23:0.0000:from 1804, and the remainder from 1805. These illustrate
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_24:0.0000:various direction^ of his poetic gifts, — the poem of sentiment,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_25:0.0000:the ballad and the romance. Among these we find Die
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_26:0.0000:sterbenden Helden^ Der blinde König (1804^; ^^ ^^^ Tod^
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_27:0.0250:Die Nonne, Der Kranz, Der Schäfer, Entsagung, Harfner-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_28:0.0500:lied. Der König auf dem Turme, Maiklage, Die Vater-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_29:0.0250:gruft. Der Sänger, Lied eines Armen, Gretchens Freude^
poemsuhland00friegoog_0033_31:0.0500:(1805). Twenty-three poems of this year were published
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_2:0.0250:acter, and he pursued the legal subjects necessary for his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_3:0.0250:degree with great assiduity. In the autumn of 1806, in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_4:0.0000:company with three friends, Jäger, Hochstetter and Kind,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_5:0.0000:he made a tour on foot through a great part of German
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_6:0.0000:Switzerland. He searched everywhere for national songs,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_7:0.0000:and was so fortunate as to discover two ancient ballads, which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_8:0.0000:he afterward published in Seckendorf s Almanack, A shoe-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_9:0.0500:maker in Meiningen recited them to him while repairing his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_10:0.0000:shoes.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_11:0.0000:Uhland's first considerable publication occurred about this
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_12:0.0000:time. Through the intervention of his friend Kölle, he sent
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_13:0.0000:twenty-seven of his own poems and seven of Kerner's to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_14:0.0000:Leo von Seckendorf in Regensburg, for insertion in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_15:0.0000:Musenalmanach for 1807. The contributions were re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_16:0.0000:ceived graciously by Seckendorf, who was surprised that he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_17:0.0000:had not heard of the two poets before. A relation of liter-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_18:0.0250:ary intimacy began, and Uhland sent further contributions
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_19:0.0000:in the form of translations from the Heldenbuch^ including
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_20:0.0500:Die Linde zu Garten (The Linden-tree of Garten) and Ol-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_21:0.0000:nifs Rächer (Avenger). A long and frank letter to Secken-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_22:0.0000:dorf illustrates his views of poetry and his aspirations at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_23:0.0000:this time : ** However much the study of old German poetry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_24:0.0000:lies near my heart, and lay there at a time when the efforts
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_25:0.0000:of the more recent writers had not been published or were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_26:0.0000:at least unknown to me, and however ardent my desire to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_27:0.0250:see myself placed in circumstances where I can contribute
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_28:0.0000:my insignificant part 'to the revival of our poetical past, in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_29:0.0000:just such a correspondingly small degree have I seen myself
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_30:0.0000:hitherto in a position to work in this field. At an age of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_31:0.0000:less than twenty years, and in connection with an opposite
poemsuhland00friegoog_0034_32:0.0500:career, it is not in itself possible for me to have attained
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_1:0.0500:great literary skill." He lamented that no public library
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_2:0.0250:was accessible to him from which he could derive hidden
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_3:0.0250:treasures; he felt the lack of material which would lend it-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_4:0.0000:self to the creative imagination, under whose influence the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_5:0.0000:deepest life of the poet becomes objective. Not only Ger-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_6:0.0000:man records, but those of related peoples, containing ac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_7:0.0000:counts of the Knights of the Round Table, of the Grail, of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_8:0.0000:Charlemagne, as well as the Old Norse narratives, demand
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_9:0.0000:attention. The spirit of Gothic knighthood was diffused
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_10:0.0000:over most of the peoples of Europe. The stories of Latin
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_11:0.0000:and German chronicles demand alike examination. All
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_12:0.0000:these have artistic value, and show threads of gold, which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_13:0.0000:the artist can elaborate, amid the slag. The poems of Des
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_14:0.0000:Knaben Wunderhorn, though often mediocre and incom-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_15:0.0000:plete, serve to illustrate that which is of more priceless value.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_16:0.0000:Seckendorf in reply urged Uhland to make an attempt to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_17:0.0000:dramatize the character of Francesca da Polenta, and For-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_18:0.0000:tunatus, both of which suggestions Uhland attempted to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_19:0.0250:carry out. He was full of poetic plans, and on March 6,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_20:0.0000:1807, wrote again to Seckendorf: " I could cite to you a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_21:0.0250:series of plans for epic and dramatic poems, which I have
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_22:0.0000:sketched with fondness, and to which I have often given a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_23:0.0000:tolerably clear form, committed in part to paper and then
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_24:0.0250:abandoned." Among these was the plot of a tragedy of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_25:0.0000:Achilles, embodying the idea that if our resolves are con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_26:0.0250:ceived firmly and clearly, even though fate hinders their
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_27:0.0000:execution, yet they are realized. ** I find it difficult to de-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_28:0.0500:pict in calm moments forms which I have seen and sketched
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_29:0.0000:in moments of inspiration. If I look around me for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_30:0.0000:poetic material, it is done primarily for the reason that purely
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_31:0.0250:ideal forms do not so readily attain perfect objectivity, as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0035_32:0.0000:those which appear to the poet already clothed with life,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_0:0.0500:BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION, xxix
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_4:0.0000:About this time the group of Tübingen students, of which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_5:0.0500:Uhland was a member, prepared, at the suggestion of Ker-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_6:0.0250:ner, a weekly paper called the Sonntagsblatt, which was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_7:0.0250:written, but not published. It was designed to be an answer
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_8:0.0250:of the young Tübingen Romanticists to the Morgenblatt, re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_9:0.0000:cently founded by Cotta, which ridiculed the Romantic
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_11:0.0000:powers in poetry and criticism. It also contained drawings,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_12:0.0500:music and caricatures.*
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_14:0.0000:Romanticism. The year of 1807-1808 was devoted to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_15:0.0000:the immediate preparation for his degree. He had three
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_16:0.0000:examinations to pass, — the first, "the Faculty examination,"
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_17:0.0250:which he sustained successfully in May, 1808, and for which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_18:0.0250:he received the predicate **r«/w laude" He succeeded best
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_19:0.0250:in Roman law; in canon law his work was less meritorious.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_20:0.0000:A few days later he presented his formal request to be ad-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_21:0.0000:mitted to his examination as advocate. It had been a long
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_22:0.0000:and weary course of study, in which he felt only the interest
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_23:0.0000:of duty, and pursued without enthusiasm. ** How I long
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_24:0.0000:for the time," he wrote, "when I shall be free from this ex-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_25:0.0000:amination-existence, when I can once more grow warm for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0036_26:0.0000:friendship, poetry and nature." On the 12th of October he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_1:0.0250:He wished now to travel, but yielded to his father*s wish
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_2:0.0000:that he should previously become a doctor of laws. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_3:0.0000:winter was enlivened by the presence of Varnhagen, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_4:0.0000:was attending lectures in the university; but the "silent, in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_5:0.0000:accessible Uhland" does not seem to have entered upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_6:0.0000:any confidential relations with him. At Easter, 1809, Ker-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_7:0.0000:ner and several of Uhland's most intimate friends left the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_8:0.0000:university, and he felt keenly the loss. ** My life has re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_9:0.0000:sembled for a considerable time a sleepless winter night,"
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_10:0.0250:he wrote in his diary. He was also occupied in writing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_11:0.0250:ballads, which he expected would constitute the largest of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_12:0.0000:his proposed volume of poems. He felt that every German
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_13:0.0250:poet should busy himself in the history of the German past,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_14:0.0000:and derive his culture from his native land. '* Goethe shows
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_15:0.0000:how by this means a poet becomes national; how familiar
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_16:0.0000:he is with German myths and popular poetry ! '* Later he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_17:0.0000:wrote to Mayer : " Recently I have regarded my poems with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_18:0.0000:eyes of distrust. I oft feel strongly that much which I
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_19:0.0250:formerly regarded as poetry is not such. Simple reflection or
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_20:0.0000:the expression of feelings, however beautiful it may be, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_21:0.0000:however much the outpouring of a beautiful soul may de-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_22:0.0000:light me, it does not seem to me to constitute true poetry.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_23:0.0000:The poet should create, should produce something new, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_24:0.0250:not simply be passive, and illuminate that which has been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_25:0.0000:bestowed upon him. How far in this respect my poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_26:0.0000:deserve to be called so, I cannot decide. This much I be-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_27:0.0000:lieve, that Kerner is incomparably more of a poet than I am.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_28:0.0000:I have altogether the greatest confidence in his poetical
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_29:0.0000:talent. Every trifle which he casts forth has life," etc. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_30:0.0000:was right in this conception of the creative and enduring in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_31:0.0250:poetry, even if he left its subtle and profounder character
poemsuhland00friegoog_0037_32:0.0000:unenunciated. He occupied his leisure with attempts at the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_2:0.0000:for two days with Beuno, a kind of tragedy. He lacked the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_3:0.0000:inventive leisure and repose to continue Francesca. Every-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_4:0.0500:thing, he again complains, he prosecutes fragmentarily. One
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_5:0.0000:act of Tamlan and Jannet he had written and could proceed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_6:0.0000:no further. The dry, lifeless details of the thesis upon which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_7:0.0000:his degree was to be based robbed him of leisure, and pre-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_8:0.0000:vented literary and poetical growth. He was unsettled.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_9:0.0000:His friends were entering the army in this decisive time.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_10:0.0000:Vamhagen had been wounded in the battle of Wagram.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_11:0.0000:On April i, i8io, the thesis to which he had devoted him-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_12:0.0000:self so long was submitted. Its title was De juris Romani
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_13:0.0000:servitutum natura dividua vel individua. This essay has
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_14:0.0000:praised up the famous jurist Vangerow ♦ as a model of keen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_15:0.0000:and delicate discrimination, and richness of content. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_16:0.0000:formal public disputation followed on April 3, and Uhland
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_17:0.0250:received the degree of Doctor of Laws to which his studies
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_18:0.0500:had been directed for nine years.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_20:0.0000:of his studies was now entered upon. Paris was the goal of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_21:0.0000:his travels. There was a practical end associated with his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_22:0.0000:residence there. Napoleon was at this time the Protector
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_24:0.0000:the Code Napoleon would be introduced in Wiirtemberg.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_25:0.0500:The chief aim of Uhland's journey was to familiarize himself
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_26:0.0250:with French law and legal procedure. Royal permission
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_27:0.0000:was at that time necessary for even an apprentice to leave
poemsuhland00friegoog_0038_28:0.0000:the borders of Würtemberg,t and no student could attend a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_2:0.0250:with personal liberty was irksome to Uhland. It was im-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_3:0.0000:possible for him to enter upon any elaborate undertaking in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_4:0.0000:foreign study. Access to the courts of Paris was at this time
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_5:0.0000:difficult. He, however, witnessed the proceedings in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_6:0.0000:Palace of Justice when they interested him, and heard lec-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_7:0.0250:tures by Pastouret and others.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_8:0.0250:His chief interest, however, was not in jurisprudence. As
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_9:0.0000:years before he had besought KÖlle to seek for treasures of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_10:0.0000:national poems in the library of Paris, so now his chief en-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_11:0.0000:thusiasm was directed to researches among its manuscripts.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_12:0.0500:He was principally engaged with the old French poems,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_13:0.0000:A series of Norman documents, some of which he translated,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_14:0.0000:interested him greatly. It was his wish to make a collection
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_15:0.0000:of translations of these poems. He translated some poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_16:0.0000:faithfully, others which existed in a diffuse form he revised,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_17:0.0000:seeking to present the legend or poem in its earlier, essen-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_18:0.0000:tial shape. He did not scorn the laborious task of copying.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_20:0.0500:were originally composed.*
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_21:0.0250:Uhland's stay in Paris brought him into intimate relations
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_22:0.0000:with many interesting men, mostly of his own country. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_23:0.0000:renewed his acquaintance with Var.nhagen, through whom
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_24:0.0000:he came to know Qiamisso, who thus expressed himself in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_25:0.0000:a letter to Varnhagen's sister, " I have made Uhland's ac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_26:0.0000:quaintance, and have read a considerable number of his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_27:0.0000:poems, among them the Schifflein. I can well say that next
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_28:0.0000:to Goethe no poet has so moved me. There are very admi-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0039_29:0.0250:rable poems which I may say everyone writes and no one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_1:0.0250:there are poems such as no one writes and everyone reads.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_2:0.0000:Of this latter class are Uhland's. Their form exists for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_3:0.0000:sake of the poetry, while in others the poetry exists for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_4:0.0000:sake of the form. Uhland is himself inconspicuous, and one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_5:0.0000:would not seek for this golden vein within him. Do you
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_6:0.0000:know Der Knab' der Berge, Der Lauf der Welt, Der kleine
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_7:0.0500:Roland? The Schifflein is. in my opinion, not his most
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_8:0.0250:attractive poem." *
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_10:0.0000:poems of the kind which all make and no one reads —
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_11:0.0250:writes such as no one makes and everyone reads. More I
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_12:0.0000:will not say. He himself is short and inconspicuous, with a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_13:0.0250:thick bark and qmte gnarled." One friend and companion
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_14:0.0500:in study was the eminent philologist Immanuel Bekker, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_15:0.0000:was schooled in the most rigid and scientific method of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_16:0.0000:study, and, although a classicist, had a wide interest in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_17:0.0000:monuments of mediaeval literature. They read together
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_18:0.0500:Spanish and Portuguese, and discussed modem poetry.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_20:0.0000:stay in Paris were : Der Rosenkranz, Der nächtliche Ritter,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_21:0.0500:Das Reh, Amors Pfeil, Schicksal, Das Ständchen, Graf
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_22:0.0250:Eberhards Weissdorn, Die Jagd von Winchester, Todesge-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0040_26:0.0250:absent longer from his country was refused, and he arrived
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_1:0.0500:his investigations among the manuscripts of Paris, and to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_3:0.0250:Kerner's Poetical Almanac for 1 812, the poems which he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_11:0.0500:The results of his studies in Paris he embodied in his essay
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_12:0.0000:upon the Old French Epic, which he sent in May, 1 81 2, to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_13:0.0250:Fouque for insertion in his periodical Die Musen, His ideal
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_14:0.0000:pursuit at this time was expressed in his own words in a letter
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_15:0.0000:to Weckherlin: **If I had the leisure and opportunity, it
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_16:0.0000:would be my favorite occupation to pursue German poetry,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_17:0.0000:on the one hand far into the North and the Orient, and on the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_18:0.0000:other, through the various lands which have been conquered
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_19:0.0250:and occupied by the Germanic nations; in the Middle Ages
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_20:0.0000:the connection is unmistakable." He had thus grasped that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_21:0.0000:conception of the inner relations of the popular literatures of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_22:0.0000:Europe which was to determine his studies and, in part, his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0041_23:0.0000:poetical productions. His aim in the study of early literature
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_1:0.0000:The year which followed his return from Paris and the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_2:0.0000:greater part of the following year (1812) were passed in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_3:0.0000:drawing up legal documents. Toward the close of the year
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_4:0.0000:the position of provisional Second Secretary in the Ministry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_5:0.0250:of Justice without salary was offered to him, with the assurance
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_6:0.0250:of compensation after six months or the position of a procura-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_7:0.0000:tor. On the 6th of December he received the appointment,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_8:0.0000:and ten days later he established himself in Stuttgart, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_9:0.0000:capital. The place of a subordinate in a bureau was ill
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_10:0.0000:adapted to a man of Uhland's independence and stem sense
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_11:0.0000:of justice. It was his duty to draw up the reports of the de-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_12:0.0000:cisions of the courts in criminal cases for submission to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_13:0.0000:king for his approval or rejection. It was not long before
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_14:0.0000:Uhland saw how justice was warped in its decrees in order to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_15:0.0000:suit the caprices of an arbitrary ruler, and how personal and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_16:0.0000:ofhcial influence modified the decisions. His superior, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_17:0.0000:Baron von der Luhe, was cold and a bureaucrat. Uhland' s
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_18:0.0000:entire time was consumed in this wearisome official labor.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_19:0.0000:He did not breathe freely in a bureaucratic atmosphere.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_20:0.0250:He was only able to devote an hour or two in the evening
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_21:0.0250:to literature in the Musseum. The minister did not always
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_22:0.0000:approve the form in which cases were prepared for submission
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_23:0.0000:to the king. Uhland requested in vain the fulfilment of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_24:0.0000:promise to bestow a salaried position upon him. He was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_25:0.0000:refused, and after a service of sixteen months, weary of being
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_26:0.0000:fed with imfulfilled promises, he resigned his position (in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_27:0.0000:May, 1 8 14), and returned to the independence of a private
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_28:0.0500:practice of law in the capital. His residence had not been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_29:0.0000:without some of the amenities of delightful social intercourse,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_30:0.0000:for many of his university friends occupied positions there;
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_31:0.0250:among these were Karl Roser, Jäger, Köstlin, Schott and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0042_32:0.0500:others. Through then) he became a member of a private
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_3:0.0000:of frequent mention during his residence in Stuttgart. Much
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_9:0.0500:had been arbitrarily set aside by the king. ,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_10:0.0000:Duke Frederick succeeded to the throne upon the death of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_11:0.0000:his father in 1797. Upon the suppression of the spiritual
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_12:0.0250:electorates in 1803 he received the title of Elector. By an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_13:0.0000:alliance with France against Austria, Napoleon had guaranteed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_14:0.0250:to the Elector Frederick not only full sovereignty, but support
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_15:0.0250:against his parliament; and two years later, by the treaty of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_16:0.0000:Brunn (December 12, 1805), the assurance of support was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_17:0.0250:repeated, and with it a recognition of the royal title. Thus
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_18:0.0000:assured of absolute power, Frederick assumed control of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_19:0.0250:treasury and the archives of the estates, and proclaimed the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_20:0.0000:subordination of the various corporations and municipal orga-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_21:0.0000:nizations. On Jan. i, 1806, he proclaimed himself king, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_22:0.0000:interpreted this new dignity as conferring unlimited power
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_23:0.0000:upon him. He joined the Confederation of the Rhine, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_24:0.0000:supported Napoelon loyally until after the crushing defeat of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_25:0.0000:Leipzig. The youth of the land was ruthlessly sacrificed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_26:0.0500:amid Russian snows, at the bidding of a foreign despot. To
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_27:0.0250:the unmeasured extravagance and profligacy of the preceding
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_28:0.0250:reign was added the enormous expense of the military es-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_29:0.0000:tablishment. The king exercised the power to increase, as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_30:0.0000:well as to mitigate, all judicial sentences. The power to con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0043_31:0.0250:trol directly or indirectly the appointments to all civil offices
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_2:0.0000:had opposed the passage of a resolution that a constitution
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_3:0.0250:should be granted and a representative assembly established
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_4:0.0250:in all states of the former empire. He maintained that such
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_5:0.0000:action was a violation of the rights of the sovereign to deter-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_6:0.0000:mine the form of government in his own country. Anticipat-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_8:0.0000:his pmpose to grant a suitable constitution to his kingdom.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_9:0.0000:The arbitrary government of the king in his earlier reign
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_10:0.0000:created a distrust of the sincerity in the present course. A
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_11:0.0000:constituent assembly met on March 15, 181 5, before which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_12:0.0000:the king laid the draft of the proposed constitution. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_13:0.0250:despotic edicts which had been issued since the abrogation of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_14:0.0000:the constitution were not set aside. The parliament which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_15:0.0250:was to meet triennially, and discuss taxes and new laws, was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_16:0.0250:powerless to alleviate the intolerable burdens which the people
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_17:0.0000:bore, or to lessen.the stringent laws of military service which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_18:0.0000:the king enacted after the aimouncement of his purpose to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_19:0.0250:grant a liberal constitution which was to be the corner-stone
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_20:0.0500:of his government. The popular excitement was intense.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_22:0.0500:popular discontent. The whole people rose to resist a con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_23:0.0000:stitutional invasion of their rights, and the deputies unani-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_24:0.0250:mously rejected the proposed draft, and issued an elaborate
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_25:0.0000:arraignment of the king's administration, recounting all the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_26:0.0000:acts of despotic power and injustice which had characterized
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_27:0.0500:hisrdgn.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_28:0.0500:Uhland appeared at this time as a political leader, — a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_29:0.0250:prominence which it is not easy to understand in the case of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_30:0.0000:a man so silent and yet so lifted, by his nature, above the petty
poemsuhland00friegoog_0044_31:0.0500:arts which win popularity. From that moment he became a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_2:0.0250:inspired confidence; the love of country pervaded his entire
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_3:0.0000:being; he was simple, incomq)tible and unpretentious. His
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_4:0.0000:education had made him a master of legal methods, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_5:0.0500:famiUar with constitutional principles. He never performed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_6:0.0250:an act with a view to personal popularity. He reverenced
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_7:0.0000:authority, but he reverenced more popular rights. He was,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_8:0.0250:besides, a fearless and inspiring singer of liberty. The as-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_9:0.0000:sembly was prorogued on July 28th. Although not a member
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_10:0.0000:of the assembly, Uhland drew up, in the name of the citizens
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_11:0.0000:of Stuttgart, an address to the king. It was like all Uhland' s
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_12:0.0000:public addresses or papers, direct, concise and frank.* No
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_13:0.0250:words were wasted and no facts had a different color because
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_15:0.0000:Upon the re-assembling of the estates, October 15, a more
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_16:0.0000:conciliatory spirit was manifested. The government was not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_17:0.0000:averse to conceding to ** Old Wurtemberg " a large portion of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_18:0.0000:its hereditary privileges, and was ready to bestow on the re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_19:0.0000:cently acquired territories, "New Wurtemberg," a constitu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_20:0.0000:tional parliament, in case a common governmental system
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_21:0.0250:could not be agreed upon. A disturbance now began which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_22:0.0000:agitated the nation in all its parts. Petitions and complaints
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_23:0.0000:poured in from all classes in the kingdom. The clergy, both
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_24:0.0000:Protestant and Catholic, presented remonstrances against the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_25:0.0000:misappropriation of revenues from their estates; the peasants
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_26:0.0000:complained of the destruction of their crops by the hunting of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_27:0.0250:the court; the imperial nobility and the cities demanded the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_28:0.0000:recognition of their privileges; all classes protested against
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_29:0.0000:arbitrary taxation and prescription. The estates appointed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0045_30:0.0000:committees to consider all these complaints. The assembly
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_1:0.0500:was practically in session for an entire year. It was during
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_2:0.0000:this period that most of Uliland's patriotic songs were writ-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_3:0.0000:ten. They were published singly and in sheets. The first
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_4:0.0500:struggle was terminated by the death of the king, October
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_5:0.0000:30, 1 81 6. The most joyful anticipations of the people were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_6:0.0000:directed toward his successor, William the First. He was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_7:0.0250:familiar with modern states, and was known to be liberally
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_8:0.0000:disposed. He had won fame as a soldier in the campaign
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_9:0.0250:of the Allies against Paris. His first utterances were liberal,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_10:0.0500:and inspired confidence. He summoned a new constitutional
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_12:0.0250:under the leadership of Karl Mayer, sought to secure his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_13:0.0250:election, but as he was not of the legal age, he could not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_14:0.0000:serve until that date, April 26, without a special dispensation
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_15:0.0000:from the king. After several months of earnest effort to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_16:0.0000:reconcile conflicting views, the king finally granted eight
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_17:0.0500:days for the acceptance or rejection of the constitution
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_18:0.0250:which he had laid before the assembly. This royal rescript
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_19:0.0500:was issued on May 26, 181 7, and on June 4 the constitution
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_20:0.0500:was rejected by a vote of sixty-seven to forty-two.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_21:0.0250:Uhland's Patriotic Poems follow step by step the progress
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_22:0.0000:of the various questions in debate. He appealed to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_23:0.0000:king to be magnanimous, to the estates to stand firm, insist
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_24:0.0000:upon the rights which their fathers had enjoyed, and to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_25:0.0000:people to maintain loyally their ancestral rights. Occasion-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_26:0.0000:ally his song assumes a solemn, almost prophetic tone, as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_27:0.0000:when he exalts the rights of the people above the will of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_28:0.0000:any prince in Nachrufe or when he interprets the sacred
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_29:0.0000:significance of the lives offered on the field of battle for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_30:0.0500:their country's freedom, as va Am 18. Oktober 181 6. These
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_31:0.0250:patriotic poems first gave to Uhland a national reputation as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0046_32:0.0500:a poet, as they made his name known throughout Germany.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_1:0.0250:Upon the dissolution of the constitutional assembly, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_2:0.0250:king put in effect many of the provisions which were in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_3:0.0000:proposed constitution. He governed, however, without a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_4:0.0000:representative body, whose ministerial conference was held at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_5:0.0000:Karlsbad in 1819, the object of which was to suppress the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_6:0.0000:liberties of the smaller states. The king, indignant at this
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_7:0.0000:encroachment by the greater powers, called again a constitu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_8:0.0500:tional assembly, which met at Ludwigsburg on July 13.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_9:0.0500:Uhland, who had now attained the legal age of membership,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_10:0.0000:was elected to this assembly from his native city. He com-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_11:0.0000:posed the address of the estates in reply to the speech from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_12:0.0000:the throne. He was the candidate of the " Old Würtem-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_13:0.0250:bergers " to represent them on the commission to report the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_14:0.0000:draft of a constitution, but his party was in a minority in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_15:0.0000:convention. The improvements which had been introduced
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_16:0.0000:in the government by the king, and the danger of imperial
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_17:0.0000:intervention in the affairs of the state, made all parties ready
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_18:0.0000:to put an end to absolute government. On the 23d of Sep-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_19:0.0000:tember a constitution was unanimously adopted, and Wür-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_20:0.0000:temberg became the fifth state in the Fatherland to rejoice
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_21:0.0000:in a constitution. The adoption of the constitution was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_22:0.0000:celebrated in the theatre by the performance of a drama by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_23:0.0000:Uhland : Herzog Ernst von Schwaben was given, for which

poemsuhland00friegoog_0047_27:0.0250:conscientious devotion to a profession in which he found no
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_6:0.0000:He sought a professorship at Bonn, at Basel and at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_7:0.0000:Heidelberg, and even the position in a gymnasium or as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_8:0.0000:keeper of the archives in Frankfort. He was exposed to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_9:0.0250:the danger that even the right to practice his profession
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_10:0.0250:might be taken from him. In a letter, probably to Vam-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_11:0.0000:hagen, he wrote, September 19, 1818: "It is possible that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_12:0.0000:the emergency may arise — and it is perhaps near — when
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_13:0.0000:I shall be obliged to leave Würtemberg. Notice has already
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_14:0.0000:been given to me that I can no longer practice here as an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_15:0.0000:advocate after the new reorganization. You know that I have
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_16:0.0000:never practiced my profession from inclination. In con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_17:0.0000:stant conflict with my nature, it consumes my inner being,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_18:0.0000:without providing me externally with a tolerable livelihood.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_19:0.0000:It was designed to be merely a device to give me an inde-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_20:0.0000:pendent support until other public occupation might inter-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_21:0.0250:vene. I have waited for this long in vain, and further
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_22:0.0250:waiting would ruin me. I am bound to my native land by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_23:0.0000:very firm bonds, and only necessity can separate me from it.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_24:0.0000:Should a means be presented by which I can remain with-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0048_25:0.0000:out sacrifice of my principles, I shall seize it with joy; in

poemsuhland00friegoog_0049_3:0.0000:for any unpleasant consequences which may result from it.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0049_7:0.0000:liberately in obedience to conscience than Uhland. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0049_8:0.0000:granting of a new constitution changed the entire situation,

poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_2:0.0250:pion of popular rights. The government was under the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_3:0.0000:baleful influence of Mettemich, and the internal policy was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_4:0.0000:liable to be inspired by the more powerful states. The con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_5:0.0000:ference at Karlsbad introduced a vigorous censorship of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_7:0.0500:mental commission. The new rights which had been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_8:0.0500:granted were constantly exposed to ministerial infringement,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_9:0.0000:as they had not been interpreted and confirmed by judicial
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_10:0.0000:decisions. Cabinet bureaucracy dominated the internal ad-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_11:0.0250:ministration. Goethe's words were here confirmed, as they
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_14:0.0500:Uhland sought to determine the legality of the various
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_15:0.0000:independent measures which the government enacted. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_16:0.0000:moved the appointment of a commission to test the con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_17:0.0000:stitutionality of the censorship which the Diet had ordered.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_18:0.0000:When Frederick List, a representative who had proposed a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_19:0.0000:reform in the administration of justice, and of the finances,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_20:0.0250:was accused before the civil tribunals, Uhland proposed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_21:0.0000:that the chamber decline to sanction his exclusion or sus-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_22:0.0000:pension as an infringement upon the rights of the law-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_23:0.0000:making power. He introduced measures to secure the in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_24:0.0000:dependence of the judiciary, to reform the antiquated usage
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_25:0.0000:of the guilds, and to limit the military budget.* As a par-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_26:0.0000:liamentary speaker, Uhland's words were slow, but full of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_27:0.0000:pith and energy; frequently a whole argument was concen-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_28:0.0000:trated in a single phrase, which seldom failed to carry con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0053_29:0.0000:viction. He attended conscientiously the sessions of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_5:0.0250:In 1827, the Senate of the University of Tübingen, by a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_6:0.0000:unanimous vote, nominated him for the professorship of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_7:0.0250:German literature, which had been established nine years
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_8:0.0500:before, but had never been filled. The government inter-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_9:0.0000:posed various objections. At last, after repeated memorials
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_10:0.0000:from the Senate, it sanctioned Uhland's appointment as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_11:0.0000:special or extraordinary professor, with salary and a seat in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_12:0.0250:the Senate. The appointment was made on December 29,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_13:0.0000:1829, and on the 3d of May, 1830, Uhland began his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_14:0.0500:lectures in the university. His studies and his tastes had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_15:0.0000:fitted him pre-eminently for such a position. In his letter
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_16:0.0000:to Kirchenrat Paulus, requesting that inquiries be made in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_17:0.0000:his behalf in Frankfort, he had referred modestly to his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_18:0.0250:researches in Paris, among the manuscripts of the Imperial

poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_20:0.0000:in which he embodied these researches, and to the poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_21:0.0000:and dramas which he had since published. As a mastery of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_22:0.0000:the mediaeval German court epics is impossible without
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_23:0.0000:knowing their source, or their parallel forms in P'rench and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_24:0.0000:Proven9al, Uhland's French studies contributed directly to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_25:0.0000:the preparation for his professorship.* His copies of old
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_26:0.0000:French manuscripts had formed the basis of Bekker's edition
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_27:0.0250:of Floire et Blanceflos, and of Keller's Guillaume d^ Angle'
poemsuhland00friegoog_0054_29:0.0500:has collected all known references to Uhland's studies in this field in

poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_9:0.0000:Uhland had early conceived the purpose of writing a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_10:0.0500:history of German literature in the Middle Ages. His first
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_11:0.0250:notable contribution to this subject was his Life of Walther
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_12:0.0000:von der Vogelweide, which he completed amid the first years
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_13:0.0000:of his parliamentary life (1821), a work which, for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_14:0.0000:freshness and beauty with which the personality of the poet
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_15:0.0000:is portrayed, has remained a standard monograph upon early
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_16:0.0000:German literature. Walther was the chief, if not the first,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_17:0.0000:political singer of his nation, with whom Uhland had much
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_18:0.0000:in common. This work won immediate recognition from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_19:0.0000:the great masters of literature. Lachmann dedicated his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_20:0.0000:edition of Walther to Uhland for German sentiment, poetry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_21:0.0250:and research, and later Wackernagel and Rieger have followed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_22:0.0000:his example. Uhland's friendship for the Baron von Lassberg,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_23:0.0000:the great collector and editor of mediaeval German manu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_24:0.0000:scripts, had begun just before this time.* Uhland's life as a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_25:0.0000:professor continued less than three years. He lectured in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_26:0.0000:the first semester on the History of German Poetry in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_27:0.0000:Middle Ages, four times weekly, to 53 students; in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_28:0.0000:winter semester of 1830-31, on the Nibelungenlied, four
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_29:0.0250:times per week, to 12 students; in the summer of 1 83 1, up-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0055_30:0.0000:on the History of German Poetry in the 15th and i6th
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_1:0.0000:Centuries, three times per week, to 22 students; and in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_2:0.0250:winter of 1831 and 1832, upon the Sagengeschichte of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_3:0.0000:Germanic and Romance nations, three times per week, to 41
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_4:0.0000:students.* Uhland held a Stylisiicumy an exercise in literary
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_5:0.0000:criticism, in which original essays, poems, etc., were pre-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_6:0.0000:sented by the students. No one of his exercises was so
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_7:0.0000:largely attended as this. It enabled him not only to discuss
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_8:0.0000:the value and province of various kinds of poetry, as well as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_9:0.0000:to express his judgment of the works of different authors, as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_10:0.0000:well as the qualities of style, the place of metaphor, etc.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_11:0.0000:After this fashion. Platen, Ossian, Heine, Goethe, folk-songs
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_12:0.0250:and didactic poetry, were criticised in a manner which,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_13:0.0250:coming from a poet of Uhland's reputation, was not only
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_14:0.0000:instructive but also served to show that his poems were not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_15:0.0000:written without a definite conception of the nature of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_16:0.0000:poetry.f Many gifted scholars participated in these exer-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_17:0.0000:cises, who afterward looked back upon them as the most
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_18:0.0000:helpful lessons of their university course. J Uhland's career
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_19:0.0000:as a professor was destined to be limited. The July Revolu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_20:0.0500:tion of 1830, which swept the Bourbons from the throne of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0056_21:0.0500:France, and awakened a spirit of liberty throughout Europe,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_2:0.0000:January, i^SSf ^^^ ^ ^^ questions of the repressed liber-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_3:0.0000:ties of past years came at once to the front. Uhland
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_4:0.0000:favored the admission to the chamber of his former enemy,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_5:0.0000:Wangenheim, who, after serving as minister, had been the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_6:0.0000:embassador of t^e kingdom at the Diet, but was then
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_7:0.0000:residing in Saxony. The government opposed his admission
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_8:0.0000:successfully. Uhland closed a spirited speech in his behalf,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_9:0.0250:claiming that Wangenheim possessed the right of spiritual
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_10:0.0250:citizenship, which was not dependent on the spot where he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_11:0.0000:was born, and that his services as Curator of the University,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_12:0.0000:and as Minister of Public Instruction, had given him a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_13:0.0000:residence in Würtemberg. He defended the admission of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_14:0.0000:four members, whose exclusion was demanded, because they
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_15:0.0000:had belonged to a political society during their university
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_16:0.0000:years. When the Privy Council called upon the chamber to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_17:0.0000:reject a motion to disapprove certain decrees of the Diet,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_18:0.0000:Uhland reported an address censuring the Council for inter-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_19:0.0500:ference with the prerogatives of the representatives of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_20:0.0000:people. The king thereupon dissolved the parliament.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_21:0.0500:Uhland was re-elected as a representative from the capital,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_22:0.0000:after an exciting canvass. When he applied for leave of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_23:0.0000:absence from the university, the government refused the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_24:0.0000:necessary permission, holding that his services were indis-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_25:0.0000:pensable. The government sought to defeat the election of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_26:0.0000:so bold a defender of popular rights in the chamber.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_27:0.0250:Uhland thereupon requested to be released from his univer-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_28:0.0000:sity duties, which the government granted "very willingly,"
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_29:0.0000:as the decree was worded. He thus, in obedience to what
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_30:0.0000:he believed to be a sacred duty, resigned a position which was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_31:0.0000:in the highest degree congenial, and which he had sought
poemsuhland00friegoog_0057_32:0.0250:for years. He now served six years more as a member of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_1:0.0500:parliament, during a period of great excitement, but where
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_2:0.0000:his party was in a hopeless minority. He supported a re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_3:0.0000:duction of the military budget in time of peace, holding that,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_4:0.0000:in case a war for the fatherland was necessary, the people
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_5:0.0000:would sustain it with patriotic sacrifices and enthusiasm,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_6:0.0250:and that a large military establishment might be used for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_7:0.0000:other than national purposes; he also supported the freedom
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_8:0.0500:of the press. His name was already known throughout
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_9:0.0250:Germany as a vigorous defender of popular rights. "When
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_10:0.0000:the parliament voted Uhland as the representative of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_11:0.0000:capital, he pronounced his judgment first of all the popular rep-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_12:0.0000:resentatives. The South-German states saw only in Prussia
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_13:0.0250:the representative of a great military system, connection with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_14:0.0000:which might threaten their rights. Uhland and his liberal
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_15:0.0250:friends opposed a tariff-union with Prussia. Upon the ex-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_16:0.0250:piration of his electoral period, he withdrew, as he supposed,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_17:0.0000:permanently from political life. He was destined, however,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_19:0.0250:field.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_20:0.0250:At a great meeting of citizens, professors and students,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_21:0.0000:held in Tübingen after the French Revolution of 1848, Uh-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_22:0.0000:land delivered a pregnant address, embodying a memorial
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_23:0.0000:to the committee of parliament, in favor of a constitution
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_24:0.0250:for a united Germany, popular armament, freedom of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_25:0.0000:press an4 of public meetings, publicity in judicial proceed-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_26:0.0250:ings, local and district autonomy, a revision of the constitu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_27:0.0000:tion to remove defects and to provide for a purely elective
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_28:0.0000:assembly. On the popular movement which swept over
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_29:0.0000:Germany, affecting kings and people alike, the Diet pro-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_30:0.0000:vided for the appointment of seventeen "men of con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_31:0.0000:fidence " to revise the constitution of the Confederation. A
poemsuhland00friegoog_0058_32:0.0000:constitutional ministry was now at the helm in Wtirtemberg
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_4:0.0500:the university honored its distinguished son with a proces-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_5:0.0500:sion and an address before his departure for Frankfort. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_15:0.0500:Should the new government be an empire or a republic?
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_18:0.0500:leading states, or be confined to one state? What should
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_23:0.0000:views which he held were in advance of his time, perhaps
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_24:0.0250:of any time. They were not reconcilable with the relations
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_25:0.0250:of the several states, and of popular and hereditary power.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_26:0.0000:In an impassioned address he favored the retention of Aus-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_27:0.0250:tria in the new state; he opposed a hereditary empire and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_29:0.0250:elective head of the empire, to be chosen periodically.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_30:0.0250:When the parliament came to vote for administrator of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_31:0.0250:empire, Uhland voted for the Baron von Gagern, thus plac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_32:0.0000:ing a citizen above sovereigns. He seems to have been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0059_33:0.0250:solitary amid these exciting times. His views did not cor-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_2:0.0000:the parliament and in his native land. He voted against
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_3:0.0250:offering the imperial crown to the king of Prussia, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_4:0.0000:against the imperial constitution as finally adopted. When
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_5:0.0000:the representatives of the leading states withdrew, he op-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_6:0.0000:posed an adjournment to Stuttgart, and composed the final
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_7:0.0250:address, in which the parliament explained to the German
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_8:0.0250:people the failure of its task. He participated in the ad-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_9:0.0000:journed or rump parliament in Stuttgart; and when the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_10:0.0000:government ordered its cavalry to prevent its sessions, he,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_11:0.0000:with his friend Albert Schott, with President Loewe in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_12:0.0250:centre, headed a procession which sought to march to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_13:0.0000:place of assembly, in token that they who had received the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_14:0.0000:mandate of the people yielded only to physical force. With
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_15:0.0000:this last dramatic act Uhland's political career ended, but
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_16:0.0000:not his interest in his country's constitutional life. He re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_17:0.0000:turned to his studies, wounded only at the failure of his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_18:0.0250:hopes and the treatment which had been inflicted in his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_19:0.0250:country upon the representatives of the German people.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_20:0.0000:In all his public life his practical sense, his judicial training,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_21:0.0500:his loyalty to conscience, as well as his hearty interest in all
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_22:0.0000:legislation that concerned the welfare of the people, made
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_23:0.0000:him a valuable legislator. He gave minute attention to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_24:0.0000:driest details of material questions. As a statesman he was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_25:0.0000:a theorist, an idealist, not always practicable, and not always
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_26:0.0000:discerning with sagacity the inevitable tendency of events.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_27:0.0250:Goethe's words show conclusively a high estimate of Uh-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_28:0.0000:land, and one which proved prophetic, though some other
poemsuhland00friegoog_0060_32:0.0250:business for the delicate nature of a poet. It is all over with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_3:0.0250:well-intentioned, capable and eloquent to be members of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_4:0.0000:parUament, but it has only one poet such as Uhland." ♦ The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_5:0.0000:years 1829 and 1834 were the most productive of his later
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_6:0.0500:poetic life. In the former year fall the ballads Die Ulme
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_7:0.0250:zu HirsaUf Der Graf von Greiers^ Bertran de Borttf Teils
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_8:0.0500:Todf and others; while in the latter year the ballad element
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_9:0.0000:was less prominent, and numerous poems of delicate senti*
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_10:0.0000:ment were written. Only eleven poems were written after
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_11:0.0250:1835, ^^^ these were in part apothegms of a few lines.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_12:0.0500:It is not in all cases easy to follow Uhland's studies as a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_13:0.0250:literary historian, which, while occupying previous years,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_14:0.0000:became the exclusive pursuit of his life after 1839, save
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_15:0.0250:during his parliamentary period of fifteen months in Frank-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_16:0.0500:fort. His early work upon the Old French Epic, published
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_17:0.0000:in 181 2, antedated French research by a score of years.t
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_18:0.0250:His work upon the myth of Thor {Der Mythus von Thor
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_19:0.0000:nach nordischen Quellen) was published in 1836. In this
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_20:0.0500:he sought to show the physical foundations of the Norse
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_21:0.0000:myths, a view supported with great learning and afterward
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_22:0.0250:in much vogue, but the application of which has been lim-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_23:0.0000:ited. The years of his university professorship were fruitful,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_24:0.0000:but their results were not published until after his death,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_25:0.0250:notably his lectures upon history of the legends of the Ger-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0061_26:0.0000:manic and Romance nations: Aus den Vorlesungen über

poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_3:0.0250:ively Swabian subjects, as the Counts Palatinate of Tübingen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_4:0.0000:and the Dead of Lustnau. These were followed by his lec-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_5:0.0000:tures on the history of German poetry in the fifteenth and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_6:0.0500:sixteenth centuries, including his studies of the poetry of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_14:0.0000:and Achim von Arnim, was published between 1806 and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_15:0.0250:1808. This fresh collection of popular songs attracted wide
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_16:0.0000:interest and revealed an unspected wealth of poetry among
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_17:0.0000:the German people. Uhland was profoundly interested in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_18:0.0000:these poems. Though the collection was uncritical and de-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_19:0.0000:fective from a scientific standpoint, yet its influence was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_20:0.0250:j;reat, not only upon poetry, but in promoting further in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_21:0.0000:vestigation in this class of poetry. He sought, whenever he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_22:0.0000:heard these unartificial songs in the mouths of the people, to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_23:0.0000:secure them. He also contemplated at one time publishing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_24:0.0250:a collection of French romances with references to the ballad
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_25:0.0000:literature of other nations. The earliest expression of an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_26:0.0250:intention to prepare such a collection occurs in a letter to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0062_27:0.0250:Lassberg.*

poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_2:0.0250:ward, whenever released from official duties, his journeys
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_3:0.0000:were directed to libraries where material for his work might
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_4:0.0000:be found. He visited all the libraries of Germany which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_5:0.0000:contained early collections of songs, printed books and manu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_6:0.0000:scripts, and even extended his journey to Copenhagen (1842)
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_7:0.0250:and the cities of Belgium. This work occupied his attention
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_8:0.0500:more exclusively, after the resignation of his professorship.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_9:0.0500:The merit of Uhland's collection consists in the scientific
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_10:0.0000:accuracy with which it was made. He sought with a keen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_11:0.0000:insight and unwearied industry to determine the original
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_12:0.0000:form of every poem. He intended to add to his collection
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_13:0.0000:an elaborate treatise on the Volkslied^ and a volume of Aotes
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_14:0.0000:to the various poems. This purpose was only in part
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_15:0.0250:carried out. Of the eight chapters of his essay originally
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_16:0.0250:contemplated, four were apparently completed, Sommer und
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_17:0.0000:Winter, Fabellieder, Welt- und Wunschlieder and Liebes-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_18:0.0000:lieder, His notes to the Volkslieder, while probably not so
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_19:0.0000:elaborate as he intended, include references upon the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_20:0.0000:bibliography, history and interpretation of most of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_21:0.0000:poems. To Uhland the Volkslieder were a revelation
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_23:0.0250:primitive, natural views. Uhland's essay upon "Summer
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_24:0.0250:and Winter ** shows how our ancestors interpreted these two
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_25:0.0250:seasons, into which the year was in their conception
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_26:0.0000:divided, and the spiritual significance which they attached
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_27:0.0000:to them. The fable-songs illustrate the time when men and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_28:0.0000:animals lived in a more intimate relation, and animals
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_29:0.0500:had, in human thought, their little world of cunning and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_30:0.0250:of tragedy. Poems of wishing and of rivalry, including
poemsuhland00friegoog_0063_31:0.0000:riddles, were an unfailing accompaniment of social life.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_2:0.0000:sions of the author are illustrated and confirmed by most in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_3:0.0250:teresting examples, from studies covering the whole field of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_4:0.0000:German poetic love. Uhland belongs to that group of poets
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_5:0.0000:to which the name ''Swabian School" has been applied,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_7:0.0250:Mayer, Gustav Pfizer and Eduard Mörike. Schiller, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_8:0.0250:Swabian by birth, had died just before the first publications
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_9:0.0250:of these poets (1805). Hölderlin, whose Hellenic spirit
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_10:0.0000:gave perfection to his verse, had ceased writing still earlier
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_11:0.0000:in the gloom which clouded his life. These poets were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_12:0.0000:pervaded by the spirit of later Romanticism, which did not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_13:0.0000:represent a distinct propaganda like the earlier Romanticists,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_14:0.0250:whose theories of poetry, criticism, philosophy, theology and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_15:0.0000:art found elaborate exposition. They were united in their
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_16:0.0000:protest against a dominant classicism as represented by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_17:0.0000:Voss, or the prescription of the editors of the Morgen-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_18:0.0250:blatt, like Weisser, Haug and Reinbeck. They loved the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_19:0.0000:fireedom, the vagueness and the national character of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_20:0.0250:Romantic poetry.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_22:0.0000:his youth, Goethe had produced the greatest impression
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_23:0.0500:upon him. Burger's popular ballads also affected him
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_24:0.0000:powerfully. If we compare his poems with those of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_25:0.0250:other members of the circle with which he was associated,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_26:0.0000:we find a perfection of poetic form, which no one of them
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_27:0.0000:attained, and which few German poets have surpassed.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_28:0.0000:Kemer possessed much poetic feeling, which was not con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_29:0.0250:trolled« and he lacked the power to accomplish his end by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_30:0.0000:the simplest means. Inspiration took the place of art in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0064_31:0.0250:his verse. Uhland's taste was surer, and was native to him.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_0:0.0250:Ivi BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION. .
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_2:0.0500:genuine poetic power. Later, when a professor, he showed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_3:0.0250:in his Stylisticum a fine criticU power in discussing the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_4:0.0250:nature of true poetry, and in illustrating his views from the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_5:0.0250:works of numerous contemporary poets. This refined taste,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_6:0.0250:the product of his maturer powers, is admirably illustrated in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_7:0.0250:his later ballads, such as Bertran de Born. A delicacy
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_8:0.0250:hardly surpassed is shown in some of the poems of senti-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_9:0.0500:ment of this period, in which his touch is equally sure. His
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_10:0.0250:themes are not numerous, but they touch a chord which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_11:0.0000:finds a response in human hearts. Such poems as Der gute
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_12:0.0500:Kamerad^ Der Wirtin Töchterlein and Der Schäfer have
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_14:0.0000:poetry. Uhland is a master of the art of producing an im-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_15:0.0500:pression by suggestion. In this particular he shares the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_16:0.0000:power of the painter, whose work wins at once to the mood
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_17:0.0250:of his painting, but leaves the observer to interpret the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_18:0.0500:subtle impression by which he is moved. Such poems as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_20:0.0250:and Entsagung possess this quality. Uhland found delight in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_21:0.0000:nature. Many of his earlier poems were a mere mirror of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_22:0.0000:external impressions. They show a sensitive youth, moved
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_23:0.0000:upon from without. But the poet rose above this tendency,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_24:0.0000:and later poems are exquisite pictures of some single mood
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_25:0.0500:of nature. Such are Ruhethal, Abendwolken, Morgens and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_28:0.0500:lieder; some have actually become such. They exhibit all
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_29:0.0250:the vividness, simplicity and delicate fancy of these natural
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_30:0.0250:products of poetical feeling. They were, in the case of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_31:0.0250:poet, a natural expression, not the result of studied effect.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0065_32:0.0250:He could represent picturesquely the peasant spirit and life.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_0:0.0500:BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION, Ivü
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_3:0.0000:While Uhland's poems of pure sentiment have won lor
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_4:0.0000:him an established position in the hearts of the people, it is
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_5:0.0000:as a ballad-singer that his rank is highest. Goethe, who was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_6:0.0250:not attracted by many of his youthful poems, praised his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_7:0.0000:ballads. They are the genuine product of the German
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_8:0.0000:spirit, and embody its ideals. They are seldom based upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_9:0.0000:classical themes, save in the Ver sacrum and in the allegory
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_10:0.0000:Der Bildsäule des Bacchus, The former is the only ballad
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_11:0.0000:which can be compared with those ballads of Schiller, which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_12:0.0000:are based upon an antique motive or incident, or illustrate
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_13:0.0000:the history of culture. Uhland's themes are few; they are
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_14:0.0000:most often love and loss, and loyalty and heroism as asso-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_15:0.0000:ciated with some historical event or person. In general, he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_16:0.0000:is concise and graphic. Occasionally, a weak and insignifi-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_17:0.0250:cant ending, as in Die Jagd von Winchester^ lessens the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_18:0.0000:effect, or a popular theme lacks a dramatic and lyrical
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_19:0.0000:quality, and the ballad becomes a mere narrative. In
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_20:0.0000:rare instances the narrative element may assume undue
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_21:0.0000:proportions, and additional incidents fail to add to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_22:0.0000:dramatic effect. This is often due to a multiplicity of refer-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_23:0.0000:ences or suggestions in the original chronicle from which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_24:0.0250:the ballad is drawn.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_26:0.0250:Ages. He turned to his country's heroic past, and sought
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_27:0.0250:to revive a spirit of heroism and patriotic feeling, by singing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_28:0.0000:again of ancient freedom and greatness. His instinct for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_29:0.0000:correctness of form, and his intellectual sanity, saved him
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_30:0.0000:from the excesses of a school of unlimited emotion. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_31:0.0000:represented the mediaeval church with sympathy. He could
poemsuhland00friegoog_0066_32:0.0000:feel the beauty of its service, and appreciate the pure ideals
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_0:0.0500:Ivüi BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_2:0.0500:often brutal, and life seemed valueless amid its gross sur-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_3:0.0000:roundings. It was not the mere history of a historic church
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_4:0.0000:which moved him so much, as the lives of saintliness and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_5:0.0250:renunciation, and the picturesque element of a faith which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_6:0.0250:could inspire a crusade or a search for the Holy Grail. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_7:0.0000:human element which was persistent, whether beneath the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_8:0.0000:veil of a nun or the garb of a penitent, interested him.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_9:0.0250:One source of the enduring popularity of Uhland's poetry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_10:0.0000:is its genuineness. It is pervaded by his own true and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_11:0.0250:manly nature. It is tender, noble and heroic, because he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0067_12:0.0500:himself was so. He never scorns or mocks at his ideals.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_3:0.0500:first collected edition of his poems in the autumn of 181 5. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_4:0.0000:had previously, in April, 1809, requested Cotta to publish a vol-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_5:0.0000:ume, but had received the courteous and familiar answer in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_6:0.0000:case of a young author, that on account of the number of his en-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_7:0.0000:gagements and the circumstances of the time he was unable to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_8:0.0250:accept an offer which would otherwise have been a pleasure to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_9:0.0000:him. A few months later Uhland wrote humorously to Kerner,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_10:0.0000:saying that he had read in Von der Hagen's Musaeum of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_11:0.0000:mastersinger Hans Volz of Nuremberg, who had a private print-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_12:0.0000:ing press, " presumably because, like myself, he could not find a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_13:0.0000:publisher," and added that he had offered his works in vain to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_14:0.0250:Mohr of Tübingen and Zimmer of Heidelberg. Cotta was only
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_15:0.0000:induced to undertake the work through the influence of the Baron
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_16:0.0000:von Wangenheim, Curator of the University of Tübingen, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_17:0.0000:was probably acquainted with the poet or his family. Later,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_18:0.0000:when Wangenheim became prime minister and the resolute enemy
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_19:0.0000:of a popular constitution, Unland, in numerous poems, and as a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_20:0.0000:member of parliament, was forced to oppose his former patron.*
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_21:0.0000:The first edition of Uhland' s work contained one hundred and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_24:0.0500:of the poems. It is in part a humorous defense of their publica-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_25:0.0000:tion. Uhland admits the pensive, even doleful (tlfigti^), charac-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_26:0.0000:ter of his earlier poems, but thinks they may be the source of joy
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_27:0.0000:and vigor, just as wine springs from the crushed grape. As the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_28:0.0000:Clown accompanied Death in the old festivals of chivalry, so
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_29:0.0250:genuine grief may find relief in jest. Possibly he who is intent
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_30:0.0000:to search, may discern in single poems the germs of greater, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_31:0.0000:discover glimpses of the poet's inmost nature in his verse. If
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_32:0.0000:some find the poems trivial, they but illustrate the times in which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_33:0.0000:they were produced, when painful oppression rested upon the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_34:0.0000:German nation during »its years of humiliation. Poetry demands
poemsuhland00friegoog_0308_37:0.0500:229
poemsuhland00friegoog_0309_35:0.0250:riches, the glory of nature, and joy in the happiness of others may
poemsuhland00friegoog_0309_36:0.0250:exist with personal loneliness and poverty in this world and with

poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_16:0.0500:In a letter to Kerner, dated Sept. 3, 1844, Uhland says : " Once
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_17:0.0000:when in our youthful years we descended from the chapel of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_18:0.0250:Wurmling, we heard some shepherd lads upon a hill beneath the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_19:0.0250:cross singing folk-songs.. We ascended in order to inquire of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_20:0.0000:them about their songs, but the boys would not utter a sound ;
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_21:0.0000:scarcely had we descended again when they sang them afresh in

poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_36:0.0000:not quicken it to desire (11, 4) and resolution. In autumn the

poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_38:0.0000:forces of nature rest, and in resignation the soul finds peace, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_39:0.0000:lives in the memory of the past. The silence which comes to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0311_40:0.0500:soul with nature's pause is akin to the surrender of one's hold
poemsuhland00friegoog_0312_21:0.0500:presented in these two characters — the shepherd longing for

poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_27:0.0000:are closely associated with scenes near his native town. From
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_28:0.0000:the heights of Tübingen the Neckar Valley is visible to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_29:0.0250:southeast, through which once extended one of the great military
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_30:0.0000:highways over which the German emperors marched to Italy to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_31:0.0000:be crowned. This valley led toward the hamlet of Wankheim, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_32:0.0000:favorite resort of the poet, where many of his poems originated.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_33:0.0250:Uhland returned from Paris, Feb. 14, 181 1, but the occasion of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_34:0.0000:this poem seems to have been a return from a brief journey to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_35:0.0500:Heilbronn and Stuttgart, a few days before the date of its com-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0320_36:0.0250:position. The pensive melancholy of this poem prevails in many
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_14:0.0250:the second edition of Uhland's Poems (1820). This poem is
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_15:0.0250:undoubtedly a personal confession and defense. It was written
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_16:0.0250:in the midst of the struggle for a liberal constitution, in which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_17:0.0000:Uhland was actively engaged, but at a time when all hopes of a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_18:0.0000:representative government had been temporarily disappointed by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_19:0.0500:the rejection by the Constituent Assembly of the liberal constitu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_20:0.0250:tion proposed by the king and a return to arbitrary government.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_21:0.0000:All reform was now at an end, and all reforming spirits were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_22:0.0250:powerless. Uhland would not accept office in a country without
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_23:0.0000:a constitution, and would have preferred to earn his bread as an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_24:0.0000:advocate in a foreign land rather then accept a position where the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_25:0.0250:sacrifice of his independence and his manhood were involved.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_26:0.0000:He rejected all inducements looking to a professorship in his own
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_27:0.0000:university, which would subject him to a loss of liberty, and require
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_28:0.0000:him to take the oath of homage to the king. All hopes of promotion
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_29:0.0000:in his native country were at end. His disappointment as ex-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_30:0.0000:pressed in the poem was a personal one, but it was even more, it
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_31:0.0000:involved the defeat of his dearest hopes for his nation's welfare.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0321_32:0.0000:A few months later he wrote sadly, to Varnhagen, that Germany

poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_23:0.0250:1805. His military spirit led him in 1807, in his nineteenth year,

poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_25:0.0000:Austria. Later, he was an officer of ordnance under General
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_26:0.0000:Berthier. At the bloody battle of Wagram he was on the staff of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_27:0.0250:the emperor Napoleon. With the army of this country he marched
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_28:0.0000:to Russia, where he distinguished himself at the battle of Smolensk,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_29:0.0000:when his bravery won for him the Order of Military Merit of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_30:0.0000:Wiu-temberg and the French cross of the Legion of Honor. At

poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_32:0.0000:by a cannon shot. He suffered great hardships on the way to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0322_33:0.0000:Wilna, where he died from the effect of his injury, and the terrible

poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_35:0.0500:Kerner, somnambulism, etc., and narrated to him by the latter,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_36:0.0250:was the story of Countess M[ede]m, who fell asleep in her child-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_37:0.0250:hood in a field of poppies, whereby she entered into a peculiar
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_38:0.0500:mental state which bewildered her as regards the persons and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_39:0.0250:things with which she was most nearly associated. Uhland used
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_40:0.0000:this suggestion to depict the ideal and the real of life, and of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_41:0.0000:the poet's dream. He said to Kerner in a letter, " Thou seest
poemsuhland00friegoog_0323_42:0.0250:that I have broken a poppy from your garden." See Notter, p.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0324_2:0.0000:the profound truth that if poetry is a dream in which the possi-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_17:0.0250:numbered many of the foremost scholars of Germany among its

poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_19:0.0250:1816, and he prepared an article upon the province of such a

poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_26:0.0250:is to be censured above all else, and German loyalty and virtue
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_27:0.0250:must accompany German words. The German language should
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_28:0.0500:never be the servant of hypocrisy and idle dalliance, but the voice
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_29:0.0250:of tender reverence and of genuine affection, and should be proudly
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_30:0.0500:consecrated to the struggle for justice and liberty. In the case
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_31:0.0500:of Uhland, the most common themes were kindled with the glow
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_36:0.0500:sacrifice which it cost Uhland to be compelled to exchange poetry
poemsuhland00friegoog_0327_37:0.0250:and the literary studies in which he found delight for the legsd

poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_33:0.0000:the members from the original dukedom and the new territory,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_34:0.0000:voted to reject the proposed constitution. The question of hered-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_35:0.0000:itary and of popular rights, and of royal privilege, agitated the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_36:0.0000:nation. The struggle which now began lasted for four years and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_37:0.0250:through three successive constitutional assemblies. It began
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_38:0.0250:under the reign of Frederick I, and was continued under that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_39:0.0000:of his son William T, when the present cctnstitution was formally
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_40:0.0000:ratified. The following poems arose during this contest, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_41:0.0250:illustrate the various political questions which were at issue.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0328_42:0.0250:They show Uhland's energetic and uncompromising political
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_3:0.0500:favor and of civil promotion. Freytag says that the Swabian
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_4:0.0000:poets were the first " artist souls " who acquired vigor from par-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_5:0.0250:ticipation in their country's politics, and among these, Uhland was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_6:0.0000:chief. No participation on the part of a German poet in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_7:0.0000:public life of his nation equals that of Uhland. He thus labored
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_8:0.0500:in the spirit of that German poet who first of all exercised a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_9:0.0500:commanding influence in politics, Walther von der Vogelweide,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_12:0.0500:Date, Feb. 24, 1816. This poem illustrates the attitude of one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_13:0.0500:political party, the " Old Wiirtembergers," of which the title of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_14:0.0250:this poem was the watchword. They maintained the existence of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_15:0.0250:certain immemorial and inalienable rights, which were not depend-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_16:0.0000:ent upon the pleasure of the crown. These rights, which had been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_17:0.0000:obtained by concessions from their rulers, were for the citizen : the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_18:0.0250:right of voluntary expatriation ; freedom from punishment, save
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_19:0.0000:after due trial before a regular tribunal and in accordance with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_20:0.0250:law; exemption from taxation and from feudal service, save as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_21:0.0250:provided by the constitution, also from enforced service at hunts
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_22:0.0250:or festivals or upon buildings ; the inviolability of property and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_23:0.0250:personal rights ; the ability to possess weapons, and freedom from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_24:0.0000:mihtary service, save in case of war and with the consent of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_25:0.0000:the estates, and then only for the period of the war; also the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_26:0.0000:protection of the church in its former privileges. The standing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_27:0.0250:army was to be recruited only by voluntary enUstments, especially
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_30:0.0000:later Elector and King (Dec. 26, 1S05), abolished the ancient
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_31:0.0000:constitution (Dec. 30, it>o5), and ruled arbitrarily ; he levied taxes,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_32:0.0000:incurred lavish expenditures and administered the national treasury
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_33:0.0000:as his personal property. The rich possessions of the Protestant
poemsuhland00friegoog_0329_34:0.0000:church were appropriated as state property. The questions which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_3:0.0250:of September, was with Uhland prolific in patriotic poems. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_4:0.0250:Baron von Wangenheim had been called from the curatorship of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_5:0.0250:the University of Tübingen to be the guiding spirit in drafting
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_6:0.0250:the new constitution of the kingdom, and the voice of the king's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_7:0.0250:absolute will, published then his pamphlet " Upon the division of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_8:0.0500:the popular representation into two sections** (t/i?^^r^/> Tren-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_10:0.0250:excitement and distrust were very great. Uhland opposed the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_11:0.0500:introduction of an Upper House, or House of Lords. Later he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_12:0.0250:published an impassioned address to the people entitled Keine

poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_19:0.0000:and the Neckar, from the Black Forest to the mountains of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_20:0.0000:Franconia and constituting the Swabian Jura, between two and

poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_25:0.0000:the Baralb, the Hardt, etc. The term 9laul)e ?llb is also applied
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_26:0.0000:to a limited portion of the range, viz., that which slopes on the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_27:0.0500:south to the Danube.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_30:0.0000:of Germany (March 7, 1138), he was involved in a contest with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_31:0.0000:Henry the Proud, Duke of Bavaria, the most powerful prince of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_32:0.0000:Germany, who had been his rival. Henry died soon after, but the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_33:0.0000:war was continued in behalf of his son, afterward Henry the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_34:0.0250:Lion, by the latter's uncle Welf VL In the beginning of Nov.,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_35:0.0250:1140, the king invested Weinsberg, which had been ^^arrisoned by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_36:0.0250:Welf. The king defeated a powerful army, sent to its relief, and,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_37:0.0250:after a month's siege, the city itself was obliged to capitulate
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_38:0.0250:(Dec. 21, 1 140). The king granted life to the women in the city,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_39:0.0250:and permission to retain whatever they could carry away on their
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_40:0.0000:shoulders. They bore out of the city their husbands, and when
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_41:0.0000:Duke Frederick sought to prevent this, the king permitted it with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_42:0.0000:the word, " A king's word cannot be perverted." The story of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_43:0.0000:deliverence dates from the century of the battle, and though
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_44:0.0000:called in question by eminent recent historians, has made the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0330_45:0.0000:fame of the women of Weinsberg illustrious through all ages.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_8:0.0500:heim (b. March 14, 1773; d. July 19, 1850). The Baron von
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_9:0.0250:Wangenheim, a native of Gotha, was one of the ablest of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_10:0.0500:many doctrinaire politicians who guided the fortunes of the states
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_11:0.0500:of South Germany in the difficult years of constitutional develop-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_12:0.0500:ment which followed the wars of Liberation. After serving the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_13:0.0500:government of Koburg-Saalfeld, where he became Vice-Presi-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_14:0.0250:dent in the ministry, he was dismissed from his post for unmask-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_15:0.0500:ing its corrupt financial system (1804?). After the fall of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_16:0.0500:German Empire he was received into the pubhc service of King
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_17:0.0500:Frederick of Wiirtemberg (1806). After the first constitution
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_18:0.0500:had been unanimously rejected by the convention, the king sum-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_19:0.0500:moned Wangenheim to draft a new one. The former draft had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_21:0.0500:arbitrary power under the guise of constitutional government.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_22:0.0500:The constitution which was outlined by Wangenheim and laid
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_23:0.0250:before the convention, Nov. 13, 181 5, though defective in details,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_24:0.0500:was a marvelous product of liberal statesmanship, but it en-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_25:0.0500:countered the bitter opposition of separate and even diverse in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_26:0.0500:terests in the kingdom. As the creation of modern political
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_27:0.0000:views, it did not ratify ancient and absolute methods or usages,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_28:0.0250:hence it was opposed by the free, popular element which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_29:0.0500:Uhland represented. The " Old Wiirtembergers " demanded
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_30:0.0000:their former constitution ; the " New Wiirtembergers " sustained
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_31:0.0000:this demand because it would guarantee to them similar rights ;
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_32:0.0250:the hereditary bureaucracy desired to recover their exclusive
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_33:0.0250:privileges: the nobility, formerly responsible only to the Empire,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_34:0.0250:and the Protestant prelates, whose vast revenues had been merged
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_35:0.0000:into those of the state, all opposed upon i>ersonal grounds the pro-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_36:0.0250:posed constitution. The party which appealed to national history
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_37:0.0250:naturally numbered the most adherents. Upon Wangenheim, as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_38:0.0250:the responsible author of the new policy, the indignation of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_39:0.0000:populace was poured out. As a foreigner it was easy to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_40:0.0250:characterize him as unfeeling for national institutions and as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_41:0.0000:having no "heart for the people." The present poem is a con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0331_42:0.0000:versation or dialogue upon ba§ alte gute ^Jtec^t, between an " Old

poemsuhland00friegoog_0332_12:0.0000:letters, praised his many gifts. Riickert differed from Uhland in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0332_13:0.0000:his view of the proposed constitution, and when Uhland published
poemsuhland00friegoog_0332_14:0.0250:the preceding poem Riickert issued a few days later (Nov. i6)
poemsuhland00friegoog_0332_15:0.0000:an equally spirited rejoinder, bearing the same title as Uhland's,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0332_16:0.0000:and later the full title, Gespräch zwischen einem Altwilrtem'
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_10:0.0250:consisting of certain royal officials and the representatives of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_11:0.0500:estates. The poem was an appeal to the representatives of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_15:0.0500:rendered impossible by the rigid insistence by the former upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_17:0.0250:the execution of the laws, and upon an independent treasury.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_18:0.0500:The main object of this commission would have been to main-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_19:0.0250:tain popular rights by obstructing the royal will. Such a system
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_20:0.0500:of government could not accord with the demands of a modern
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_22:0.0500:element, in effect partly hereditary, and of the knighthood, in ad-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_23:0.0500:dition to representatives of the cities, would not have been an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_24:0.0500:effective executive body. Though a similar organization had been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_32:0.0250:character, and not limited to questions which agitated his country
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_33:0.0500:alone. The people had conquered on that memorable day ; they
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_34:0.0500:had rescued the princes from humiliation, but freedom had not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_35:0.0500:resulted, because justice had not been established. The blood of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_36:0.0250:the people had been poured out, but the worldly-wise needed to be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0333_37:0.0250:informed that the motive of this great sacrifice was simple justice.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_22:0.0000:out the proposed changes in the constitution without reference to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_23:0.0000:the popular sentiment and without regard to national history.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_24:0.0000:The poem ends with a touching appeal to the king, to whose
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_25:0.0500:royal house their ancestors had been loyal, and in whose personal
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_29:0.0000:son of Duke Ulrich, was born May 12, 1515, and reigned from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_30:0.0500:Nov. 6, 1550, to Dec. 28, 1568. He is honored as the founder of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_31:0.0000:the national constitution. He ratified the Compact of Tübingen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_32:0.0250:of 15 14, between the crown and the estates, which, formed the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_33:0.0500:magna charta of the liberty of his country. By this treaty it was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_34:0.0000:provided that no war should be entered uf>on thereafter without
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_35:0.0500:the knowledge and consent of the estates ; that free emigration
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_36:0.0250:from the country should be permitted to all citizens ; that neither
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_37:0.0000:land nor people should be pledged without the advice, knowledge
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_38:0.0000:and consent of the estates ; that the estates should no longer
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_39:0.0000:be responsible for the ducal obligations, and that extraordinary
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_40:0.0250:assessments should no longer be levied and no citizen should be con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_41:0.0250:demned, save after just trial and in accordance with law. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_42:0.0250:appHcation of these principles in administration, and the regula-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0334_43:0.0500:tion of the civil affairs of the dukedom was the great merit of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_2:0.0500:lated in accordance with the new Protestant faith ; public " Ger-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_13:0.0500:March of this year, the king laid before the parliament the draft
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_14:0.0250:of a new constitution, believing, as he said, that " only by an es-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_15:0.0500:tablished legal order could he establish the permanent happiness
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_16:0.0250:of his people ; this aim he hoped to attain by a constitution whose
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_17:0.0500:leading principle should be justice, and whose leading character-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_18:0.0500:istic should be publicity." This was the third constitution which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_19:0.0250:had been laid before the chamber for ratification. This constitu-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_20:0.0000:tion was alike opposed by Uhland and his friends as embodying
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_21:0.0250:serious defects, and the assembly in rejecting it (June 2) declared
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_22:0.0250:that an imperfect constitution ought not to go into effect. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_23:0.0250:objections urged against the new constitution were, that it em-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_24:0.0250:bodied a bi-cameral system, including a house of lords, and failed
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_25:0.0000:to provide for a permanent committee of control in the interim of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0335_26:0.0000:the sessions of the parliament, with a treasury at its disposal.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0336_31:0.0000:in its earlier, Low German form, dates back to the middle of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0336_32:0.0000:eleventh century. The chivalric spirit and the misfortunes of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0336_33:0.0000:this young prince won the popular sympathy. The friendship of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0339_17:0.0500:joyed the esteem of Uhland. He wrote numerous books in rapid

poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_6:0.0250:Owing to the storms of the early spring and the snows of autumn,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_7:0.0500:the harvest failed. There was no food for man or beast. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_8:0.0250:poor sought to sustain life by eating cooked roots and grasses.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_9:0.0500:But limited relief was possible before the harvest of the following
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_10:0.0250:year. The court and government made heroic sacrifices in order
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_11:0.0000:to secure grain from foreign countries. Amid all the distress, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_12:0.0250:queen was most tender in her ministrations to the suffering.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_13:0.0250:Through her influence, charitable societies were formed, and all

poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_19:0.0000:Uhland, whose political attitude at the time made him an op-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_20:0.0000:ponent of the government, could not refrain from offering a tribute
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_21:0.0000:to the ruler whom all loved. In a letter to his parents dated
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_22:0.0000:Feb. 5, he wrote : " I enclose to you, dear parents, a poem which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_23:0.0000:I have written upon the queen's death. I believed that it was more
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_24:0.0000:suitable to publish it without my name. But I make no secret
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_25:0.0000:that I am its author, which might be easily guessed." Some
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_26:0.0000:months later, when Uhland presented an address to the king on
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_27:0.0000:behalf of the Parliament, the king expressed to him his indebte£iess
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_28:0.0500:for the poem. Uhland answered that it expressed his deepest
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_29:0.0000:emotions. The king thereupon said that while they might differ
poemsuhland00friegoog_0340_30:0.0250:in opinions, he hoped they would not dififer in feeling. Witwe ^

poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_7:0.0000:upon an island on the coast of Normandy. His host demanded
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_9:0.0000:that his ship was laden with precious goods from the Mediterranean
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_10:0.0250:and armor from the North, he was told that a story or a song was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_11:0.0000:required from the guest, who came from the land of his fathers.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_12:0.0000:Balder thereupon related how the son and daughter of two mighty
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_13:0.0000:northern counts who had suffered common peril in battle and upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_14:0.0000:the deep, were betrothed, the boy in youth when he was receiving
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_15:0.0000:his first training in arms, and the maiden while still in her cradle.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_16:0.0000:Through the heedlessness of the women in care of the girl, a boat
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_17:0.0250:in which she had been placed was borne away by the waves. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_18:0.0000:young hero sought in vain to ride with his steed into the ocean
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_19:0.0000:and rescue her. Ships which were sent in search traversed the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_20:0.0250:sea in vain, and terrible storms arose. At last they returned
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_21:0.0000:bringing the empty bark, and all hope of rescuing the little bride
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_22:0.0000:was abandoned. The youth became a sea-rover wedded to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_23:0.0000:sea in which his bride wearing her ring had perished. His boat
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_24:0.0000:was splendid, like a wedding ship. He won great sea-fights, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_25:0.0000:was called the ** Bridegroom of the Ocean." Richard the fisher,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_26:0.0000:who had listened to the story, had once known heroic tales of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_27:0.0000:Norman dukes and heroes, but now his memory was weak and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_28:0.0000:confused, and he begged his foster daughter Thorilde to sing the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_29:0.0500:" Song of the Maiden and the Ring." The weird song touched
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_30:0.0250:Balder' s heart ; he recognized the maiden with golden locks, by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0342_31:0.0250:the ring which she wore, as his lost bride, and his wedding boat

poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_12:0.0000:all Uhland's poems which he retained. He was reluctant to in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_13:0.0000:clude this vigorous youthful production in the collected edition
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_14:0.0500:of his works, and only yielded to the insistence of his friend
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_15:0.0000:Mayer. His severe judgment has, in several cases, omitted poems
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_16:0.0250:of much freshness and beauty. See Mayer, VoL I, p. 48. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_17:0.0500:original title of the poem was Der Helden Sterbgesang. Uhland
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_18:0.0000:became acquainted with the heroic forms of Northern history
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_19:0.0000:and mythology through the work of Saxo Grammaticus (1204),
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_20:0.0250:which he read in his boyhood with eager interest in the German

poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_25:0.0000:son laments that he is snatched away from his beloved in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_26:0.0000:vigor of youth and from heroic song. The father answers that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_27:0.0500:he shall be received into Walhalla, the glorious temple of gods
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_28:0.0000:and heroes, where he shall banquet with Odhin the All-father,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_29:0.0250:where his beloved, faithful in death, shall reach to him the goblet
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_30:0.0250:at the feast. It is true, the father says, that the picture of many
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_31:0.0250:heroic deeds will not be emblazoned on his shield ; but one deed,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_32:0.0000:death for one's fatherland, will outweigh them all. The heroes
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_33:0.0000:die in the midst of victory. A romantic feature is given to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_34:0.0000:poem in the death of the youth's golden-haired bride, who was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0344_35:0.0500:wont to watch for him from the tower.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_6:0.0500:The subject was tatken from Saxo Grammaticus, Lib. IV, 93-96,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_7:0.0000:like the preceding. The brave Danish king, Wermund, who had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_8:0.0000:become old and blind, was challenged by the king of the Saxons
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_9:0.0000:to surrender his realm, since he could no longer administer it, or,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_10:0.0000:should he decline, permit his son to contest with the son of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_11:0.0250:Saxon king for its possession. King Wermund offered to fight
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_12:0.0250:personally with the Saxon king, but the latter refused to contend
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_13:0.0250:with a blind adversary. The ambassadors then insisted upon the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_14:0.0000:contest between the sons. Wermund had a son, Uffo, born to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_15:0.0000:him late in life, a silent prince who surpassed all youths of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_16:0.0000:equal age in bodily strength, but had been regarded as lacking
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_17:0.0000:intelligence and spirit. The prince begged permission from his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_18:0.0000:father to answer the ambassadors, and offered to fight, not only
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_19:0.0000:with the son of the Saxon king, but with the most powerful cham-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_20:0.0000:pion whom he could bring with him. The aged king rejoiced at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_21:0.0000:these words, and could only convince himself that it was his son
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_22:0.0000:by touching his limbs and his face. An island in the Eider
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_23:0.0000:River had been chosen as the place of combat, in accordance
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_24:0.0000:with ancient Norse usage. Skrep, a famous blade, which nothing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_25:0.0000:could withstand, had been buried because the king could not in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_26:0.0000:trust it to his son, and would grant it to no other, was now given
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_27:0.0000:to the young prince. The people stood upon the shore ; but the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_28:0.0000:king, Wermund, placed himself at the end of the bridge so that,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_29:0.0000:in case his son fell, he could throw himself into the river, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_30:0.0000:awaited anxiously the result. Uffo distrusted his sword because
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_31:0.0000:it was rusted and weak, and received the blows of the Saxons on
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_32:0.0000:his shield at first. He delayed to strike until he had separated
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_33:0.0000:his two adversaries, and then, with one blow, severed the body of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_34:0.0000:the Saxon champion, and afterward slew the Saxon prince. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0345_35:0.0000:king recognized the sound of his ancient blade, and rejoiced.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0348_36:0.0250:Spiegel, Werke, XIV, 89, qt, etc. The first syllable is here

poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_14:0.0000:entering halls of merriment, was not unfamiliar in the popular
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_15:0.0250:ballads of other nations. The paintings and frescoes illustrating
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_16:0.0250:the Dance of Death, danse macabre, which originated in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_17:0.0250:14th century and were placed on the walls of cloisters and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_18:0.0250:churches, may not only have sprung from this conception but
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_19:0.0250:have intensified it. Uhland represents Death's weird and chilling
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_20:0.0000:approach : the sky grows dark, the earth trembles at his presence.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_21:0.0250:As he draws near, the flowers wither and fall The familiar
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_22:0.0250:modern Greek poem of Demos has a similar imagery. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_23:0.0250:romantic element always enters into Uhland's poems. It is not
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_24:0.0000:the mere depiction of the grim powers of fate, but love and life,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_25:0.0250:youth and age, courage and beauty, are introduced to make the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0349_26:0.0250:contrast complete. The king, who has rejoiced over the victory

poemsuhland00friegoog_0350_29:0.0000:Uhland recognized that this involved a repetition of incident,

poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_35:0.0250:the maiden was Marie Josefe Dalb, who fell exhausted when she
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_36:0.0000:heard the words of the landlord, and learned that her exertion
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_37:0.0000:was in vain. She lived eleven years in an unconscious state,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_38:0.0000:without the power to move, the only sign of life being a scarcely
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_39:0.0250:perceptible token of breathing. The purely pathetic is not neces-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_40:0.0000:sarily poetic ; and it may be questioned here whether the former
poemsuhland00friegoog_0352_41:0.0250:element does not dominate in this poem, to the expense of the

poemsuhland00friegoog_0354_20:0.0000:those in which the thought is only suggested, and left to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0354_21:0.0250:imagination of the reader. It is apparently unconscious, but at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0354_22:0.0500:the same time the highest art. The hearer is won into the mood

poemsuhland00friegoog_0355_29:0.0500:ment, with young knights eager for recognition, and the veteran
poemsuhland00friegoog_0355_30:0.0250:crusader, who has grown gray in conflict, returning weary to his

poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_14:0.0500:the vowel sounds, while less musical languages lay stress upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_15:0.0500:the consonants. Assonance consists in the correspondence of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_16:0.0500:vowels of the last accented syllable (^cbung) and of the vowels
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_17:0.0500:of the following unaccented syllable (Scnfung) in recurring lines.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_18:0.0500:The assonance must return at regular intervals in order to strike
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_19:0.0500:the ear and be carried on in the mind. Owing to the absence in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_20:0.0500:German of full vowels, a, o, u, in final syllables, and the dominance
poemsuhland00friegoog_0357_21:0.0500:of the weak vowels, e and /', assonance in less perfect. Assonance

poemsuhland00friegoog_0358_23:0.0000:many songs in her praise in the Proven§al language, for he was a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0358_24:0.0000:famous poet. He induced an astrologer to cast her horoscope,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0358_25:0.0250:who declared that a remarkable event would happen at her [sup-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_8:0.0250:Duke Richard, son of Henry II. of England, was his work.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_9:0.0000:Richard's brother Henry, governor of Anjou, who was beloved

poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_12:0.0000:Henry a sense of injury, and stung him to action against his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_13:0.0000:brother, the pretext of which was the fortification by Richard
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_14:0.0250:of the castle of Clairvau, which belonged to Anjou. King Henry

poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_35:0.0000:Bertran, who had been the chief instigator of the struggle, was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_36:0.0000:conducted to the tent of the king, who addressed him harshly :
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_37:0.0000:" Bertran, Bertran, you once boasted that you did not require the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_38:0.0000:half of your wits ; now, however, you seem to need them all."
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_39:0.0000:" Sire," Bertran answered, " it is true that I said this, and I told
poemsuhland00friegoog_0360_40:0.0250:the truth, but now I no longer possess them." " How so ? " asked

poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_7:0.0000:Viscount of Hautefort, a castle with nearly a thousand retainers.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_8:0.0000:He had a brother, and would have dispossessed him of his inheri-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_9:0.0000:tance, had it not been for the King of England. He was always
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_10:0.0000:at war with all his neighbors, with the Count of P6rigueux, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_11:0.0250:with the Viscount of Limoges, and with his brother Constantine,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_12:0.0000:and with Richard when he was Count of Poitou. He was a good
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_13:0.0000:cavalier, and a good warrior, and a good lover, and a good trouba-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_14:0.0000:dour ; and well informed and well spoken ; and knew well how to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_15:0.0000:bear good and evil fortune. Whenever he wished, he was master
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_16:0.0000:of King Henry of England and of his son ; but always desired
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_17:0.0250:that father and son should be at war with each other, and one
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_18:0.0000:brother with the other. And he always wished that the King of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_19:0.0000:France and the King of England should be at variance ,* and if
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_20:0.0000:there were either peace or truce, straightway he sought and en-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_22:0.0000:was dishonored by it. And he had great advantages and great
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_23:0.0000:misfortunes by thus exciting feuds between them. He wrote
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_24:0.0250:many satires, but only two songs. . . . And he set his whole
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_25:0.0000:heart on fomenting war; and embroiled the father and son of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_28:0.0250:* In this notice the old biographer indicates the dominant trait
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_29:0.0250:of Bertrand's character very distinctly ; it was an unbridled pas-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_30:0.0500:sion for war. He loved it not only as the occasion for exhibiting
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_31:0.0000:proofs of valor, for acquiring power and winning glory, but also,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_32:0.0000:and even more, on account of its hazards, on account of the exal-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_33:0.0000:tation of courage, and of life which it produced, nay, even for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_34:0.0000:sake of the tumult, the disorders, and the evils which are accus-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_35:0.0000:tomed to follow in its train. Bertrand de Born is the ideal of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_36:0.0000:the undisciplined and adventuresome warrior of the Middle Age,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0361_37:0.0000:rather than that of the chevalier in the proper sense of the term.*

poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_10:0.0250:It has been supposed that the source of this poem was found in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_11:0.0250:the Quirina/ia, a Latin poem of Metellus of Tegernsee, written
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_13:0.0500:grave of St. Quirinus in the church of the former Benedictine
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_14:0.0250:Abbey. This poem should be compared with Die verlorene
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_16:0.0250:ful representations of the mediaeval church. Uhland reverenced
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_17:0.0250:the service which this church had done for civilization and human-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_18:0.0250:ity, and saw the faith and worship of the Middle Ages in a golden
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_19:0.0250:light. The metrical form of the poem is like that of iBertran

poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_29:0.0000:commander of the Spanish Army of the North. He was born in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_30:0.0250:1 781, in Idozin, a village of Navarre. His active military career
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_31:0.0500:extended, with brief intermissions, from 1809 to 1836. He fought
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_32:0.0250:against French domination, against absolutism in government,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_34:0.0000:which Wellington fought in the West, Mina was indefatigable
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_35:0.0250:in opposing the French in the East. His genius and patriotism
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_36:0.0000:and absolute supremacy in his native province caused him to be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_37:0.0000:called the " King of Navarre." When Wellington entered France
poemsuhland00friegoog_0363_38:0.0250:from Spain in 1814, Mina commanded one division of his army.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_2:0.0250:England. When the Revolution of July, 1830, broke out, he was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_3:0.0000:again in Spain, fighting, but unsuccessfully, in behalf of the con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_4:0.0000:stitutional movement. In 1834 he was placed at the head of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_5:0.0000:Spanish forces which supported the Regent, Queen Christina,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_6:0.0000:against the Carlists, but sickness and infirmity prevented his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_7:0.0000:bearing an active part in this campaign. He was made Captain-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_8:0.0000:General of Catalonia in October, 1835, but died in Barcelona the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_9:0.0000:following year, Dec. 24, 1836. He is a type of several brilliant
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_10:0.0000:chiefs who worked simultaneously for the cause of liberal govern-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_11:0.0000:ment in Spain. He was of the greatest personal gallantry. His
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_12:0.0000:military movements were made with the greatest celerity, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_13:0.0250:usually with splendid success. He knew no sentiment of human-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_26:0.0250:this poem upon one habitually unlucky is a humorous satire on
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_27:0.0000:the poet himself. It was written a few days after his breach with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_28:0.0000:the Minister of Justice, who refused to accord to Uhland a sal-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_29:0.0000:aried position in his bureau, such as had been promised. He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_30:0.0000:wrote soon after to Mayer, " It is true that I was not born to be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_31:0.0250:an advocate. I lack especially a talent for acquisition, but it
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_32:0.0250:has become my vocation." f All his hopes for a professorship
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_33:0.0250:seemed blasted. Repeated applications for government positions
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_34:0.0000:where his legal studies might be advantageously employed, had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_35:0.0000:been rejected, and efforts to secure a publisher for a volume of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_36:0.0000:his poems had been fruitless. Under these circumstances he was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_37:0.0000:almost ready to regard himself as a failure. In reference to a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_38:0.0500:gloomy tragedy which Uhland entitled Johannes Parricida^ he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0364_39:0.0500:remarked, " It was with him as it is with me: he was unlucky in

poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_9:0.0000:folk-song, Der versunkene Brautring, in Herder's Volkslieder,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_10:0.0000:in which sad forebodings and final realization attach to the loss

poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_21:0.0000:first Duke of Wiirtemberg (1495), made a journey to the Holy Land
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_22:0.0000:in 1468. Tradition says that he brought back with him a thorn-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_23:0.0000:branch of the species from which the crown of thorns of Christ
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_24:0.0000:was made. He planted the branch in the grounds of the little
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_25:0.0000:castle of Einsiedel in the forest of Schönbuch. The twig grew
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_26:0.0000:until it became a mighty shrub, indicating by its growth the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_27:0.0000:extension or decline of the ducal house. The little castle of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_28:0.0000:Einsiedel was a favorite resort of Eberhard; and here, in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_29:0.0000:neighboring cloister of the Blue Monks, he found his final resting
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_30:0.0000:place. The castle is still preserved in part ; and in the centre of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_31:0.0000:the grounds a stately white thorn-tree is standing, which is said
poemsuhland00friegoog_0365_32:0.0000:to have sprung from the original tree which was brought from

poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_4:0.0000:gathering Uhland improvised a poem having a like motive, Die

poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_6:0.0000:forgotten her morning prayers in her ardor for the chase. As
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_7:0.0000:she suddenly recalls her omission and bends in prayer over her
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_8:0.0250:rifle, she is startled by a stir in the thicket, and the most splendid

poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_25:0.0250:of June 10, 1809, Uhland suggested that the ballad of The Young
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_26:0.0000:Tamlane, recently translated by Professor Conz, would afford
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_27:0.0250:excellent material for a drama. On Feb. 6, 18 10, he wrote to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_28:0.0000:Mayer that he had finished one act and a scene of Tamlan

poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_37:0.0000:Tam Lin feared that he might be the offering. He therefore
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_38:0.0250:persuaded his earthly love, Janet, to meet him " at the mirk and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_39:0.0000:midnight hour," when " the fairy folk do ride," and to draw him
poemsuhland00friegoog_0368_40:0.0000:from his milk-white steed. He would be turned into an esk and

poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_3:0.0250:His sister sent a minstrel to discover his abode. The minstrel
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_4:0.0250:sang of the sorrows of Gwendolin, Merlin's wife, and of his sister
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_5:0.0000:Gwendydd. The strains of the minstrel softened Merlin's grief,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_6:0.0000:who revealed himself, and consented to return to the court of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_7:0.0250:Rhydderch. Here the gayety of the crowd distracted him, and he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_8:0.0250:attempted to return to his forest life, but his friends detained
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_9:0.0500:him. Madness in Celtic lore imparted mysterious power and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_10:0.0000:control over the forces of nature. Merlin's prophetic character
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_11:0.0000:and knowledge of hidden things was shown by revealing to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_12:0.0000:king secrets respecting the conduct of the queen.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_13:0.0000:While residing at court, he saw the queen passing through the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_14:0.0000:hall. The king accosted her kindly and embraced her ; and seeing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_15:0.0000:a leaf lodged in her hair, removed it. Merlin, who had seen his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_16:0.0000:act, burst into loud laughter, but refused at first to explain the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_17:0.0000:cause of his mirth, unless the king would promise solemnly to set
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_18:0.0000:him at liberty. Upon receiving this assurance. Merlin stated that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_19:0.0000:the queen had just returned from a meeting with her lover in an
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_20:0.0000:arbor, and that a leaf had clung to her hair. The sight of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_21:0.0000:king removing so courteously the leaf which bore witness to the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_22:0.0250:queen's frailty seemed to Merlin irresistibly comical. The queen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_23:0.0000:sought to discredit Merlin's prophetic power, and thus regain
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_24:0.0250:the confidence of the king. This scene, transferred to the king's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_25:0.0500:daughter, forms an incident in Uhland's poem. Later Merlin re-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_26:0.0250:turned to the forest, where he became associated with Taliessin,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_27:0.0000:one of the most renowned bards in Welsh song. While bathing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_28:0.0000:in a fountain he was healed of his madness, but refused to return
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_29:0.0000:to rule over his people, as they desired, and spent his life in holy
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_30:0.0250:retirement in the forest.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_33:0.0250:Besides the historic King Arthur, there was a prophet-bard,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_34:0.0500:Myrdhinn, or Merlin, who, after the final struggle of the North-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_35:0.0250:ern and Southern Celts, went mad with grief after the fatal battle
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_36:0.0000:of Ardderyd. He predicted the resurrection of a national hero,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_37:0.0000:who should rise like the dawn from his retreat, when discord
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_38:0.0500:among the British tribes should cease, and a victorious federation
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_39:0.0500:be formed. The anticipated hero was identified as King Arthur,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_40:0.0000:and the glory attaching to the mythical restorer of Celtic power
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_41:0.0000:became the subject of the legends of Arthur and the Knights of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_42:0.0000:the Round Table. The elaboration of these legends, and of that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_43:0.0000:of Merlin the Enchanter, the reputed tutor of Arthur, occurs in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_44:0.0000:the Latin poem of Geoffrey of Monmouth, which was revised in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0370_45:0.0500:its present form about 1147. This bold and brilliant account of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_3:0.0500:appeared in French as the Roman du Brut, De Vita et Vatici-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_5:0.0500:Merlin is a favorite subject of modern literature. Tennyson's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_6:0.0500:Vivien, in the Idylls of the King, is a picture full of subtle poetic
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_7:0.0000:power. It is based upon the account of Merlin in Malory's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_8:0.0000:Morte d^ Arthur. Merlin is represented in Tennyson as becom-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_9:0.0000:ing fascinated with Lady Vivien, whose blandishments cause him
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_10:0.0000:to reveal the spell by which one can be forever encircled by a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_11:0.0000:charm from which he cannot escape. Vivien has been stung by
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_12:0.0000:the voices of derision of the court, and in anger she determines to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_13:0.0000:vindicate herself forever by associating her name with Merlin's,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_15:0.0000:glory of conquering the mighty Wizard.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_16:0.0250:Thus, when Merlin is locked by her spell beneath the stone, she
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_17:0.0000:gives a cry of exultation, for her glory is forever linked with his.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_18:0.0250:In Sir Thomas Malory's Morte d^ Arthur, published by Caxton
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_19:0.0000:in 1845, there is a lack of motive. Merlin falls in love with Ninue,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_20:0.0250:" the dfamosel of the lake," one of the ladies that King Pellemore
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_21:0.0000:brought to the court, who induces Merlin to go under a wondrous
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_22:0.0250:stone to tell her of the marvels there, " but she so wrought that
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_23:0.0000:he never came out." Lib. Ill, Ca/>. XLII and LX. In the ver-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_24:0.0000:sion of the Early English Text Society, the desire to possess
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_25:0.0000:Merlin forever, to hold him in eternal love, is the motive of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_26:0.0250:enchantment, which is more romantic, but possesses less psycho-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0371_27:0.0250:logical interest than in Tennyson's Vivien. See also Alfred

poemsuhland00friegoog_0374_30:0.0000:poem was composed on the occasion of a visit to Tübingen, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0374_31:0.0000:sent to his friend Schott to be read to the company which assem-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_3:0.0500:No. 27 ; Gedichte^ 1831. A ballad based upon a Swiss legend of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_4:0.0250:the Count of Greiers. The ancestral castle of the Counts of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_5:0.0500:Greiers (Greyerz or Gruy^res) is one of the best preserved in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_6:0.0500:Switzerland. Its towers and walls still remain. It is situated in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_7:0.0500:a beautiful valley of the present Canton of Freiburg. The pos-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_9:0.0250:humanity, formerly embraced a considerable portion of the Vecht-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_10:0.0000:land. Uhland's home was not distant from Switzerland, and he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_11:0.0250:f>assed many summers in excursions among its mountains. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_12:0.0250:egend upon which the poem is based is as follows: Upon a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_13:0.0500:Saturday evening in summer seven peasants, among them the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_14:0.0250:fair shepherdess Marguita, began the favorite ring or circular
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_15:0.0250:dance, coraula, upon the meadow before the castle. This dance
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_16:0.0250:is of great antiquity, and is still retained among the peasants of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_17:0.0250:many nations. The dancers in their progress summoned the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_18:0.0250:youths and maidens to join them, and so they proceeded from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_19:0.0250:village to village, the dance continuing for several days. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_20:0.0250:young Count Rudolf was drawn into the dance, and leaped and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_21:0.0250:sang with the others. Gradually their numbers swell^, until
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_22:0.0500:more than. seven hundred participated. The dance ended upon
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_25:0.0500:Alpine meadows, and invited all the shepherds and shepherdesses
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_26:0.0250:of the neighborhood to join in a festival of danj:e and song.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_27:0.0500:Suddenly a terrific temjyest swept down from the mountain
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_28:0.0250:chasms, overthrew the tent, and scattered the dancers, and caused
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_29:0.0250:them to seek refuge in the desolate caverns and isolated shep-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_30:0.0250:herd-huts. The young count was borne away by a sudden moun-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_31:0.0250:tain torrent, and only rescued with difficulty. He retained the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_32:0.0250:memory of the happy, careless days in which he was a shepherd,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_33:0.0250:and often from his desolate, stately castle longed for the joys of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_34:0.0500:those free days. To Marguita, the most beautiful of the shep-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_35:0.0500:herdesses, he gave the finest Alpine pasture. Fate willed a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0375_36:0.0500:different life for him, and the wave which bore him away was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_7:0.0500:village on the first Sunday in May, or that used for the celebra-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_8:0.0500:tion of the festival of May. üJlaibaum is usually equivalent to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_9:0.0250:33irfe, birch, or beech. In Bavaria it is often the pine or fir-tree.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_17:0.0000:The metre of the poem is a modern form of the Nibelungen
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_18:0.0500:verse. The popularity of this measure is largely due to Ubland's
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_19:0.0000:use of it in his ballads. The strophy consists of four lines, each
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_20:0.0500:divided by a caesura, or metrical pause, into two half-lines con-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_21:0.0500:taining three accented syllables (<^ebungen). The modernization
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_22:0.0250:of the Nibelungen verse consists in retaining strictly and uni-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_23:0.0000:formly the iambic rhythm, that is, the initial (unaccented) beat
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_24:0.0250:(^uftaft) ; the thesis (Senfung) must also be preserved and be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_25:0.0000:monosyllabic. The measure of this verse being fixed, it admits
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_26:0.0250:of no transferred accent, and requires the preservation of the caesura,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_27:0.0000:which must correspond with the sense. The thesis is seldom
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_28:0.0250:dissyllabic. Wilhelm Müller, Platen, Rückert, and Grün have
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_29:0.0250:followed Uhland in the use of this verse. Compare Des Sängers
poemsuhland00friegoog_0376_31:0.0500:pp. 409-411.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_6:0.0000:An ancestor of Uhland, John Michael Uhland, who fought under
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_7:0.0000:the Elector Max Emanuel of Bavaria, as quartermaster, accord-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_8:0.0250:ing to a family tradition, cut down a Turkish pasha. In mem-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_10:0.0000:cut in stone over the entrance to his house. Birlinger believes
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_11:0.0250:abo that Uhland was familiar with passages in Abraham a Sancta
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_12:0.0500:Clara, see his famous tract (1683), quoted by Schiller in Wal-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_21:0.0000:strikingly characteristic of the folk-songs, both in manner and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_22:0.0000:verse. In a single line the whole scene is depicted, without any
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_23:0.0000:description of actors, or introduction. The baseness of the act is
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_24:0.0000:shown by its being directed against the noble lord, and in the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_25:0.0000:place in which it was perpetrated. The servant's ambition leads
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_26:0.0000:him to forget gratitude and loyalty to his master, and he strikes
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_27:0.0250:him down in the dark woods, when his lord is unsuspicious and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0378_28:0.0000:unprotected. His momentary success and pride are checked.

poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_14:0.0000:to Italy, where, in a rocky cave near Siena, she bore a son,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_15:0.0500:Rolando, so called from his falling (rolling) down the cliff, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_16:0.0500:name which was afterward changed into Orlando. The father,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_17:0.0000:Milon, who supported the family, was borne away by a torrent.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_18:0.0000:The young Roland went daily to Siena to beg alms. He was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_19:0.0000:greatly beloved by the lads of his own age, and came to surpass
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_20:0.0500:them all in prowess. As he was scantily dressed, the boys
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_21:0.0500:bought cloths of different colors and had a long coat made for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_24:0.0000:entertained with great state by the citizens, and Roland received
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_25:0.0000:his portion of food and drink with the others. When once he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_26:0.0250:came too late, he pressed into the imperial apartments, where the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_27:0.0000:Emperor sat at meat, and carried away with rare audacity a silver
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_28:0.0000:platter. The emperor was so pleased at this boldness that he bade
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_29:0.0250:his attendants permit the lad to withdraw unmolested. On the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_30:0.0000:following day he went again, and as he was about to sieze a golden
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_31:0.0000:goblet, the emperor cried out in order to startle him. But the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_32:0.0000:boy held the goblet firmly, and grasped the emperor by his gray
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_33:0.0000:beard, and said, "An emperor's voice is not enough to terrify
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_34:0.0250:me," and bore away the goblet. The emperor ordered that he
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_35:0.0500:should be followed by four cupbearers, who discovered the Prin-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_37:0.0000:granted, not knowing that it was his sister. He then caused her
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_38:0.0000:to be brought, but, upon recognizing her, was so overcome with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_39:0.0000:fury that he struck her to the floor. The young Roland there-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_40:0.0000:upon, full of anger, fell upon the emperor, and would have done
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_41:0.0250:him serious harm had not the others intervened. A reconcilia-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_42:0.0000:tion now took place, and Roland became one of the most heroic
poemsuhland00friegoog_0379_43:0.0250:paladins of his uncle. His father, Milon, who had been kept at
poemsuhland00friegoog_0380_2:0.0500:life of Charlemagne, mentions Roland only as the Marquis of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0380_39:0.0500:bücher'). The original, Le livre des quatrefils Aymon, describes

poemsuhland00friegoog_0381_21:0.0250:of St. Andrew on Mt. Soracte near Rome, wrote an account of a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0381_22:0.0250:fictitious journey of Charles to Jerusalem with a million soldiers,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0381_23:0.0250:where he received from the Persian king, Aaron (Harun), the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0381_24:0.0250:charge of the Holy Sepulchre. Several Old French poems are

poemsuhland00friegoog_0385_14:0.0500:administrators of the royal domains, especially of the imperial

poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_20:0.0000:selves and their heirs, that no division of their estates should be
poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_21:0.0500:made, and that in default of male heirs in one line, the entire pos-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_24:0.0250:save by common consent. Count Eberhard secured the indepen-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_25:0.0000:dent administration of eight castles and cities, while Count Ulrich
poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_26:0.0500:retained only the ancestral castle of Würtemberg and the city of

poemsuhland00friegoog_0386_36:0.0500:Leonberg, and Neckar-Ems. It was surrounded on all sides by the

poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_24:0.0250:against Eberhard, and sought to take him prisoner. In the spring
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_25:0.0000:of 1367 Count Eberhard with his wife and son Ulrich, with the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_26:0.0000:latter's wife and child, were resting in the secluded valley of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_27:0.0250:Enz, near the springs of Wildbad, when the knights of the hostile
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_28:0.0000:league fell suddenly upon them without a previous proclamation of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_29:0.0000:war. A poor peasant warned the count of his danger, and offered
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_30:0.0000:to guide him over rocks and chasms across the Kaffelberg, bearing
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_31:0.0000:him at times upon his back, until he reached in safety the castle
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_32:0.0000:of Zavelstein. The count, in testimony of his gratitude, had a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_33:0.0500:medal cast to commemorate the event, upon one side of which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0387_37:0.0500:waters is given by Uhland's friend, Justinus Kemer, in his book,

poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_13:0.0250:Count of Eberstein and the nobles collected a great army in
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_14:0.0000:Heimsheim, and chose three leaders, Wolf von Stein and Rein-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_15:0.0000:hard and Friedrich von Enzberg, whom they called " kings," pre-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_16:0.0500:paratory to an attack upon Count Eberhard. But the vigilant
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_17:0.0500:count, being apprised of the plot of his enemies, drew together
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_18:0.0500:his troops from the royal city of Esslingen, and an army of peas-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_19:0.0000:ants, and by a swift march invested Heimsheim in the night so
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_20:0.0000:that no one could escape. The beleaguered enemy prepared for a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_21:0.0500:valiant defence, and hurled stones from the walls upon the besie-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_22:0.0000:ging army. Eberhard, however, caused wood to be brought from
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_23:0.0000:the forest, which was covered with pitch and petroleum, ready to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_24:0.0000:be set on fire, and placed it around the walls. When the besieged
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_25:0.0000:saw the fate prepared for them, they offered to surrender. They
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_26:0.0000:were permitted to pass out through a single gate, when they were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_27:0.0000:taken prisoners. As the nobles came forth in succession, and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_28:0.0250:among them the three chiefs who called themselves "kings," a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_29:0.0500:witty peasant cried out " Ha ! that is fine. See the three kings
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_30:0.0000:coming. If the fourth were here, we should have a full pack
poemsuhland00friegoog_0388_31:0.0250:of cards." In the old Latin, " Ha, quam bene factum est, ecce

poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_20:0.0000:hard attributed the failure of success in his siege of the fortress
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_21:0.0000:of Neu-Eberstein, by which he hoped to take vengeance for the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_22:0.0000:attack upon him in Wildbad, to the withdrawal of the troops of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_23:0.0000:the cities. The bitterness between the municipalities and the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_24:0.0000:knights was further intensified by the murder of Ulrich von Hel-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_25:0.0000:fenstein, the Captain of the League of Upper Swabia, which was
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_26:0.0000:attributed to the agency of Graf Eberhard. In the contest which
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_27:0.0000:followed, the League was defeated in a great battle north of Ulm,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_28:0.0000:April 7, 1372. The Emperor Karl IV sought at this time to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_29:0.0000:conquer the Mark of Brandenburg, and in furtherance of his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_30:0.0000:plans imposed heavy taxes upon the cities, and intrusted their
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_31:0.0250:collection to the stern and hated Eberhard. In 1376 the cities
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_32:0.0000:renewed their alliance, pledging themselves to mutual support
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_33:0.0000:against any who should infringe their rights and liberties, or
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_34:0.0000:oppress them, whether by assessment, alienation of their estates,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_35:0.0000:or in any other way, save the Holy Empire, and even against the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_36:0.0500:Emperor they agreed to act in common. They thus formed the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_37:0.0000:league of the " Stadler."
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_38:0.0500:Karl, in order to secure the election of his son Wenzel as
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_39:0.0000:Roman king and future emperor, was ready to secure the support
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_40:0.0250:of the German princes by large sacrifices and grants of money
poemsuhland00friegoog_0389_41:0.0000:and land. With this object in view, he pledged the free imperial

poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_4:0.0250:night of May 14, 1377, upon a plundering expedition against the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_5:0.0000:territory and the cities of Count Eberhard. Returning through
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_6:0.0000:the valley of Urach, after a successful foray, in which they had
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_7:0.0000:burned the village of Jettingen, and laden with plunder, they
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_8:0.0000:were attacked by Count Ulrich, who descended from the lofty
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_9:0.0000:fortress of Achalm, making a circuit of the mountain in order to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_10:0.0000:attack the column of the citizens in the rear. He was accom-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_11:0.0000:panied by a considerable body of noble knights with gold trap-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_12:0.0000:pings, and two hundred and thirty foot soldiers. On a meadow
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_13:0.0000:between the chapel of St. Leonard and the city of Reutlingen the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_14:0.0000:contest began. The nobles alighted from their horses and fought
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_15:0.0000:on foot. A part of the garrison sallied forth from the city through
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_16:0.0000:an unused gate, and'attacked the nobles in the rear. The loss of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_17:0.0000:the nobles was very great. The chronicler says that, after the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_18:0.0000:conclusion of peace^ eighty-six gentlemen and armor-bearers were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_19:0.0000:sought in vain. Count Ulrich was wounded, and regained with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_20:0.0250:difficulty the fortress of Achalm. Count Eberhard grieved greatly
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_21:0.0000:over this defeat, and was said to have cut in two the tablecloth
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_22:0.0000:between him and his son, a mediaeval custom to signify dishonor
poemsuhland00friegoog_0390_23:0.0250:and exclusion from fellowship, in vogue among the noble. " Anno

poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_32:0.0500:which is the subject of the preceding poem. In the interval the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_33:0.0500:League of Cities had been strengthened by union with those of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_35:0.0500:lay and spiritual lords had united with them. In August of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_36:0.0250:above year, the troops of Augsburg, Ulm, and other cities, invaded
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_38:0.0500:Döffingen, a small town near the imperial city of Weil, north-west
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_39:0.0500:of Tübingen. Count Eberhard hastened in company with the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_40:0.0500:Count Palatinate of the Rhine, the Marquis of Baden, the Bur-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_41:0.0250:grave of Nuremberg, the Bishop of Würzburg, with their troops.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_43:0.0500:soldiers. The League of Cities had eight hundred lancers. The
poemsuhland00friegoog_0391_44:0.0500:nobles fought on foot. When Count Ulrich saw the hosts of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_1:0.0500:Reutlingers, he burned to avenge his previous defeat, and to wipe
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_2:0.0500:out his disgrace in his father's sight. He fought in the front
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_3:0.0000:rank where the battle was fiercest, and fell mortally wounded.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_4:0.0000:He was borne by those near him to the trunk of a fallen tree
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_5:0.0000:for support, where he died. The Wiirtembergers lost heart for a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_6:0.0250:moment at the death of their prince ; but when the tidings were
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_7:0.0000:carried to his father, the old warrior cried * " Be not dismayed.
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_8:0.0000:He is like any other man. Stand bravely. Lo 1 the enemy flee."
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_9:0.0000:At the same time, sword in hand, he pressed with the greatest
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_10:0.0000:valor upon the enemy. As Eberhard's forces charged, the troops
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_11:0.0000:of the cities were thrown into disorder and fled, and the nobles
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_12:0.0000:won a glorious but by no means bloodless victory. The battle
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_13:0.0000:occurred on Sunday, the twenty-third of August, St. Bartholo-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_14:0.0000:mew's day. Eberhard, who had repressed his grief during the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_15:0.0000:battle, when night came could no longer restrain it, but grieved
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_16:0.0250:for his only son. On the following day he received the joyful
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_17:0.0000:message that Count Ulrich's wife, Antonia, had borne a son and
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_18:0.0250:heir to the throne. Thanking God the desolate (aged) prince

poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_20:0.0000:The historian relates that no small part of the victory was due
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_21:0.0000:to Count Eberhard's former enemy, Wolf von Wunnenstein, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_22:0.0000:noble of ancient lineage, called, from the splendor of his arms,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_23:0.0000:«the shining Wolf" (ber ölci|cni)' Söolf). This knight, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_24:0.0000:had begun to fear the growing power of the League of Cities,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_25:0.0000:offered his services to Count Eberhard, in spite of his ancient
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_26:0.0000:enmity. The latter, distrusting his sincerity, declined his assist-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_27:0.0000:ance, as he had forces sufficient to overcome his enemies. When,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_28:0.0000:however, the tide of battle was about turning in behalf of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_29:0.0000:citizens, Wolf, with a band of followers, appeared in the midst
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_30:0.0250:of the conflict, and turned impending defeat into victory. Eber-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_31:0.0000:hard recognized the service which had been done, and invited
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_32:0.0000:Wolf to accompany him to Stuttgart. Wolf accepted, and said
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_33:0.0000:that he would test Eberhard's generosity. But, after proceeding
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_34:0.0250:a few miles, he suddenly repented, and, saying that he had gone
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_35:0.0250:far enough, bade Eberhard farewell, with »©utc 9{ad^t, e§ fielet

poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_39:0.0000:and his companions robbed a peasant of his flocks. The peasant
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_40:0.0250:hastened to Stuttgart to report this robbery to the count, who
poemsuhland00friegoog_0392_41:0.0250:laughed, and said that the old Wolf had simply taken meat for

poemsuhland00friegoog_0395_13:0.0000:music and delicate sentiment. The sound of the human voice
poemsuhland00friegoog_0395_14:0.0000:or of the hunter's horn often constituted a judicial limit, estab-

poemsuhland00friegoog_0395_33:0.0000:Italians were wont to dedicate a * sacred spring ; ' for, when great
poemsuhland00friegoog_0395_34:0.0000:dangers occurred, they vowed to sacrifice all creatures which the

poemsuhland00friegoog_0397_14:0.0250:Napoleon. To interpret the scene as describing him would in-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0397_15:0.0000:volve manifold contradictions, which would weaken its effect. As

poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_14:0.0250:" The idea is : The story of the hero is transmuted into poetry

poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_31:0.0000:Percy, it precedes. It refers to the murder of James Stewart,
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_32:0.0000:Earl of Murray, by the Earl of Huntley. In December, 1591, the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_33:0.0000:Earl of Bothwell had made an attempt to seize the person of his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_34:0.0000:sovereign, James VI., in Holyrood Palace, but having failed, took
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_35:0.0000:refuge in the North. The Earl of Huntley was a violent enemy
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_36:0.0000:of the Earl of Murray, and gave out that the latter had been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_37:0.0000:seen in the palace on the night of the assault. King James gave
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_38:0.0000:a commission to the Earl of Huntley to pursue Bothwell in his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_39:0.0000:retreat with fire and sword. Under cover of this order, he pro-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_40:0.0000:ceeded to avenge his private quarrel with the Earl of Murray, a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_41:0.0000:young noble of the greatest promise and the darling of the
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_42:0.0000:people. Murray was induced to come from the North, and, while
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_43:0.0000:residing in a house in Donibristle, he was surrounded by Hunt-
poemsuhland00friegoog_0398_44:0.0250:ley's forces, and the house burned to the ground. Murray broke

poemsuhland00friegoog_0399_20:0.0250:del Carpio, is represented in the Cronica General^ as having been
poemsuhland00friegoog_0399_21:0.0250:slain in prison and then bound upright upon his steed, and thus

poemsuhland00friegoog_0400_5:0.0000:was always of importance to him to see personally the region

poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_29:0.0000:He is often regarded as the greatest of Slavonic poets. His early
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_30:0.0250:ballads and romances were published in 1822 ; later, while holding
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_31:0.0000:a professorship of literature in the gymnasium of Kowno, he \xr
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_32:0.0000:came an object of suspicion on account of his connection with
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_33:0.0250:certain patriotic associations, and was banished for five years to
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_34:0.0000:European Tartary. His life was spent in practical exile from his
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_35:0.0000:native land ; he lived in Russia, Italy, and France. He held for
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_36:0.0000:a short time a professorship of Latin in Lausanne, and later, of
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_37:0.0250:the Slavic languages in the College de France (i 840-1843). He
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_38:0.0500:was honored by Napoleon III., but died while seeking to raise a
poemsuhland00friegoog_0403_39:0.0000:Polish battalion to fight against Russia in the Crimean War.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_4:0.0250:and they were the lessons, too, which required most time and trouble
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_5:0.0000:to "bring up," so as to escape his censure. I learned from him that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_6:0.0000:poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seemingly, that of the wildest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_7:0.0000:odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science ; and more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_8:0.0000:difficult, because more subtle, more complex, and dependent upon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0011_9:0.0000:more, and more fugitive causes. "In the truly great poets " he would

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_0:0.0250:PREFACE.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_1:0.0500:At first sight the extreme simplicity of the greater number
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_2:0.0000:of these selections from Wordsworth may appear to make
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_3:0.0250:editing and annotating almost superfluous, but a closer view
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_4:0.0000:will reveal the truth that the poet's simplicity is not the -direct
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_5:0.0000:method of childhood, but rather of a profound (however suc-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_6:0.0000:cessful) manhood guided by both instinctive and acquired rules
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_7:0.0000:of art.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_8:0.0000:Classes in our schools may be expected to understand the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_9:0.0000:thoughts and feelings of the simpler poems here more readily
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_10:0.0250:than they would understand the average work of poets like
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_11:0.0500:Coleridge and Byron ; while the more difficult poems here can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_12:0.0500:hardly prove so obscure as the most difficult poems of other
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_13:0.0500:great poets.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_15:0.0250:stumbling-block to those who study them. It is in storm,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_16:0.0000:passion, and excess, that the untrained find most to interest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_17:0.0000:them whether in picture, play, or real life. So in poetry, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_18:0.0000:warlike lines of Scott, the straining and heaving cadences of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_19:0.0000:Byron, and the morbid, tear-starting beauty of parts of Long-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_20:0.0000:fellow and Tennyson, seize upon the young student with power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_21:0.0250:and stir him into feeling. But these poets are to Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_23:0.0000:as a Christinas dinner to a frugal meal. .
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_25:0.0000:some, healthful thoughts and feelings of this poet, thoughts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_26:0.0250:that never err from the line of truth and good sense, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0013_28:0.0500:nature to prefer these to the tumult and excitement of more

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_2:0.0000:and Puritan diet of Wordsworth without first making them as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_3:0.0250:simple, as wise, and as passionless? However one may reply to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_4:0.0000:these questions one will not deny that the reverence, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_5:0.0000:modesty, and love of all good and beauty found in this poet's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_6:0.0000:works are qualities that every right-minded pupil may be led
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_7:0.0000:to respect, and that a study of these verses cannot fail to do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_8:0.0500:good in a land where reverence for the Wordsworthian virtues
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0014_9:0.0500:is satf by the thoughtful to be far from conspicuous.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_0:0.0500:ESSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 11
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_2:0.0500:any violent shock to the public taste would be a temerity not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_3:0.0250:to be risked, it is still quite permissible to speak of Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_4:0.0250:worth's poetry, not only with ignorance, but with impertinence.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_6:0.0250:I cannot think, then, that Wordsworth has, up to this time,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_7:0.0250:at all obtained his deserts. " Glory/' said M. Renan the other
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_8:0.0000:day, "glory after all is the thing which has the best chance of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_9:0.0000:not being altogether vanity." Wordsworth was a homely man,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_10:0.0000:and himself would certainly never have thought of talking of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_11:0.0000:glory as that which, after all, has the best chance of not being
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_12:0.0000:altogether vanity. Yet we may well allow that few things are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_13:0.0000:less vain than reed glory. Let us conceive of the whole group
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_14:0.0000:of civilised nations as being, for intellectual and spiritual
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_15:0.0000:purposes, one great confederation, bound to a joint action and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_16:0.0000:working towards a common result; a confederation whose
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_17:0.0000:members have a due knowledge both of the past, out of which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_18:0.0000:they all proceed, and of one another. This was the ideal of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_19:0.0000:Goethe, and it is an ideal which will impose itself upon the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_20:0.0000:thoughts of our modern societies more and more. Then to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_21:0.0000:recognised by the verdict of such a confederation as a master.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_22:0.0000:or even as a seriously and eminently worthy workman, in one's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_23:0.0000:own line of intellectual or spiritual activity, is indeed glory ; a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_24:0.0000:glory which it would be difficult to rate too highly. For what
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_25:0.0000:could be more beneficent, more salutary 1 The world is for-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_26:0.0000:warded by having its attention fixed on the best things ; and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_27:0.0000:here is a tribunal, free from all suspicion of national and pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_28:0.0000:vincial partiality, putting a stamp on the best things, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_29:0.0000:recommending them for general honour and acceptance. A
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_30:0.0000:nation, again, is furthered by recognition of its real gifts and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_31:0.0000:successes ; it is encouraged to develop them further. And here
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_32:0.0000:is an honest verdict, telling us which of our supposed successes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_33:0.0000:are really, in the judgment of the great impart a! world, and not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0015_34:0.0250:in our own private judgment only, successes, and which are not.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_2:0.0000:so hard to make sure that one is right in feeling it ! We have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_3:0.0000:a great empire. But so had Nebuchadnezzar. We extol the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_4:0.0000:" unrivalled happiness " of our national civilisation. But then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_5:0.0000:comes a candid friend, and remarks that our upper class is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_6:0.0000:materialised, our middle class vulgarized, and our lower class
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_7:0.0000:brutalised. We are proud of our painting, our music. But we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_8:0.0000:find that in the judgment of other people our painting is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_9:0.0250:questionable, and our music non-existent. We are proud of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_10:0.0000:our men of science. And here it turns out that the world is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_11:0.0000:with us ; we find that in the judgment of other people, too,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_12:0.0250:Newton among the dead, and Mr. Darwin among the living,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_13:0.0000:hold as high a place as they hold in our national opinion.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_14:0.0000:Finally, we are proud of our poets and poetry. Now poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_15:0.0000:is nothing less than the most perfect speech of man, that in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_16:0.0250:which he conies nearest to being able to utter the truth. It
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_17:0.0250:is no small thing, therefore, to succeed eminently in poetry.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_18:0.0000:And so much is required for duly estimating success here, that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_19:0.0000:about poetry it is perhaps hardest to arrive at a sure general
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_20:0.0000:- verdict, and takes longest. Meanwhile, our own conviction of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_21:0.0000:the superiority of our national poets is not decisive, is almost
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_22:0.0000:certain to be mingled, as we see constantly in English eulogy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_23:0.0000:of Shakspeare, with much of provincial infatuation. And we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_24:0.0000:know what was the opinion current amongst our neighbours
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_25:0.0000:the French, people of taste, acuteness, and quick literary tact,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_26:0.0000:not a hundred years ago, about our great poets. The old
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_27:0.0000:Biographic Universelle notices the pretension of the English to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_28:0.0000:a place for their poets among the chief poets of the world, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_29:0.0250:says that this is a pretension which to no one but an English-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_30:0.0000:man can ever seem admissable. And the scornful, disparaging
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0016_31:0.0000:things said by foreigners about Shakspeare and Milton, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_2:0.0250:poets. Yes, some anti-Gallican cynic will say, the French
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_3:0.0000:rank him with Corneille and with Victor Hugo ! But let me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_4:0.0250:have the pleasure of quoting a sentence about Shakspeare,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_5:0.0000:which I met with by accident not long ago in the Correspond-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_6:0.0000:ant, a French review which not a dozen English people, I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_7:0.0000:suppose, look at. The writer is praising Shakspeare's prose.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_8:0.0000:With Shakspeare, he says, "prose comes in whenever the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_9:0.0000:subject, being more familiar, is unsuited to the majestic Eng-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_10:0.0000:lish iambic." And he goes on : " Shakspeare is the king of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_11:0.0250:poetic rhythm and style, as well as the king of the realm of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_12:0.0000:thought ; along with his dazzling prose, Shakspeare has suc-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_13:0.0000:ceeded in giving us the most varied, the most harmonious
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_14:0.0000:verse which has ever sounded upon the human ear since the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_15:0.0000:verse of the Greeks." M. Henry Cochin, the writer of this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_16:0.0250:sentence, deserves our gratitude for it ; it would not be easy to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_17:0.0000:praise Shakspeare, in a single sentence, more justly. And
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_18:0.0250:when a foreigner and a Frenchman writes thus of Shakspeare,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_19:0.0000:and when Goethe says of Milton, in whom there was so much
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_20:0.0000:to repel Goethe rather than to attract him, that " nothing has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_21:0.0000:ever been done so entirely in the sense of the Greeks as Sam-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_22:0.0000:son Agonistes" and that " Milton, is in very truth a poet whom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_23:0.0000:we must treat with all reverence," then we understand what,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_24:0.0000:constitutes a European recognition of poets and poetry as con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_25:0.0250:tradistinguished from a merely national recognition, and that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_26:0.0000:in favour both of Milton and of Shakspeare the judgment of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_27:0.0500:the high court of appeal has finally gone.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_30:0.0000:cated by the Amphictyonic Court of final appeal, definitive
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_31:0.0000:glory. And even for poets and poetry, long and difficult as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_32:0.0000:may be the process of arriving at the right award, the right
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_33:0.0250:award comes at last, the definitive glory rests where it is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0017_34:0.0000:deserved. Every establishment of such a real glory is good
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_1:0.0500:and wholesome for mankind at. large, good and wholesome for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_6:0.0000:and certainly his lovers and admirers cannot flatter themselves
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_7:0.0000:that this great and steady light of glory as yet shines over him.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_8:0.0000:He is not fully recognized at home ; he is not recognised at all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_9:0.0000:abroad. Yet I firmly believe that the poetical performance of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_10:0.0250:Wordsworth is, after that of Shakspeare and Milton, of which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_11:0.0000:all the world now recognises the worth, undoubtedly the mosfc
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_12:0.0000:considerable in our language from the Elizabethan age to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_13:0.0250:present time. Chaucer is anterior ; and on other grounds, too,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_14:0.0000:he cannot well be brought into the comparison. But taking
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_15:0.0000:the roll of our chief poetical names, besides Shakspeare and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_16:0.0000:jkilton, from the age of Elizabeth downwards, and going
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_17:0.0000:through it, Spenser, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Goldsmith, Cow-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_18:0.0000:per, Burns, Coleridge, Scott, Campbell, Moore, Byron, Shelley,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_19:0.0250:Keats (I mention those only who are dead), I think it certain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_20:0.0000:that Wordsworth's name deserves to stand, and will finally
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_21:0.0000:stand, above them all. Several of the poets named have gifts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_22:0.0250:and excellences which Wordsworth has not But taking
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_23:0.0000:the performance of each as a whole, I say that Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_24:0.0000:seems to me to have left a body of poetical work superior in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_25:0.0250:power, in interest, in the qualities which give enduring fresh-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_26:0.0250:ness, to that which any one of the others has left.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_27:0.0250:But this is not enough to say. I think it certain, further,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_28:0.0250:that if we take the chief poetical names of the Continent since
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_29:0.0000:the death of Moliere, and, omitting Goethe, confront the re-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_30:0.0250:maining names with that of Wordsworth, the result is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_31:0.0000:same. Let us take Klopstock, Leasing, Schiller, Uhland,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_32:0.0250:Biickert, and Heine for Germany ; Filicaia, Alfieri, Manzoni,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_33:0.0250:and Leopardi for Italy; Racine, Boileau, Voltaire, Andrd
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0018_34:0.0000:Chenier, BeVanger, Lamartine, Musset, M. Victor Hugo (he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_0:0.0500:ESSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 15
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_1:0.0250:has been so long celebrated that although he still lives I may
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_2:0.0000:be permitted to name him) for Franca Several of these, again,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_3:0.0000:have evidently gifts and excellences to which Wordsworth can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_4:0.0000:make no pretension. But in real poetical achievement it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_5:0.0250:seems to me indubitable that to Wordsworth, here again,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_6:0.0000:belongs the palm. It seems to me that Wordsworth has left
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_7:0.0000:behind him a body of poetical work which wears, and will
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_8:0.0000:wear, better on the whole than the performance of any one of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_9:0.0250:these personages, so far more brilliant and celebrated, most of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_10:0.0000:them than the homely poet of Rydal. Wordsworth's perform-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_11:0.0000:ance in poetry is on the whole, in power, in interest, in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_12:0.0250:qualities which give enduring freshness, superior to theirs.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_13:0.0250:This is a high claim to make for Wordsworth. But if it is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_14:0.0000:a just claim, if Wordsworth's place among the poets who have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_15:0.0500:appeared in the last two or three centuries is after Shakspeare,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_16:0.0000:Moliere, Milton, Goethe, indeed, but before all the rest, then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_17:0.0250:in time Wordsworth will have his due. We shall recognise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_18:0.0000:him in his place, as we recognise Shakspeare and Milton ; and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_19:0.0000:not only we ourselves shall recognise him, but he will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_20:0.0000:recognised by Europe also. Meanwhile, those who recognise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_21:0.0000:him already may do well, perhaps, to ask themselves whether
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_22:0.0000:there are not in the case of Wordsworth certain special
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_23:0.0000:obstacles which hinder or delay his due recognition by others,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_24:0.0500:and whether these obstacles are not in some measure remova-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_25:0.0250:able.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_27:0.0000:are by no means Wordsworth's best work. His best work is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_28:0.0000:in his shorter pieces, and many indeed are there of these which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_29:0.0000:are of first-rate excellence. But in his seven volumes the pieces
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_30:0.0250:of high merit are mingled with a mass of pieces very inferior
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_31:0.0000:to them ; so inferior to them that it seems wonderful how the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_32:0.0000:same poet should have produced both. Shakspeare frequently
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_33:0.0000:has lines and passages in a strain quite false, and which are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0019_34:0.0250:entirely unworthy of him. But one can imagine his smiling if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_1:0.0500:one could meet him in the Elysian Fields and tell him so;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_2:0.0000:smiling and replying that he knew it perfectly well himself,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_3:0.0000:and what did it matter ? But with Wordsworth the case is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_4:0.0250:different. Work altogether inferior, work quite uninspired,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_5:0.0250:flat and dull, is produced by him with evident unconsciousness
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_6:0.0000:of its defects, and he presents it to us with the same faith and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_7:0.0000:seriousness as his best work. Now a drama or an epic fill the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_8:0.0000:mind, and one does not look beyond them ; but in a collection
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_9:0.0000:of short pieces the impression made by one piece requires to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_10:0.0000:continued and sustained by the piece following. In reading
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_11:0.0000:Wordsworth the impression made by one of his fine pieces is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_12:0.0500:too often dulled and spoiled by a very inferior piece coming
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_13:0.0500:after it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_14:0.0250:Wordsworth composed verses during a space of some |>ixty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_15:0.0000:years ; and it is no exaggeration to say that within one single
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_16:0.0000:decade of those years, between 1798 and 1808, almost all his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_17:0.0000:really first-rate work was produced. A mass of inferior work
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_18:0.0000:remains, work done before and after this golden prime, imbed-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_19:0.0000:ding the first-rate work and clogging it. obstructing our approach
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_20:0.0000:to it, chilling, not unfrequently, the high-wrought mood with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_21:0.0250:which we leave it. To be recognized far and wide as a great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_22:0.0250:poet, to be possible and receivable as a classic, Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_23:0.0000:needs to be relieved of a great deal of the poetical baggage
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_24:0.0000:which now encumbers him. To administer this relief is indis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_25:0.0250:pensable, unless he is to continue to be a poet for the few only,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_26:0.0000:a poet valued far below his real worth by the world.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_28:0.0500:not according to any commonly received plan of arrangement,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_29:0.0000:but according to a scheme of mental physiology. He has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_30:0.0000:poems of the fancy, poems of the imagination, poems of senti-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_31:0.0000:ment and reflection, and so on. His categories are ingenious
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_32:0.0000:but far-fetched, and the result of his employment of them
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_33:0.0000:unsatisfactory. Poems are separated one from another which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0020_34:0.0250:possess a kinship of subject or of treatment far more vital and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_0:0.0500:ESSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 17
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_4:0.0000:We may rely upon it that we shall not improve upon the classi-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_5:0.0000:fication adopted by the Greeks for kinds of poetry ; that their
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_6:0.0250:categories of epic, dramatic, lyric, and so forth, have a natural
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_7:0.0000:propriety, and should be adhered to. It may sometimes seem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_8:0.0000:doubtful to which of two categories a poem belongs ; whether
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_9:0.0000:this or that poem is to be called for instance, narrative or lyric,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_10:0.0000:lyric or elegiac. Bub there is to be found in every good poem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_11:0.0000:a strain, a predominant note, which determines the poem as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_12:0.0000:belonging to one of these kinds rather than the other ; and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_13:0.0000:here is the best proof of the value of the classification, and of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_14:0.0000:the advantage of adhering to it. Wordsworth's poems will
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_15:0.0000:never produce their due effect until they are freed from their
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_16:0.0250:present artificial arrangement, and grouped more naturally.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_17:0.0000:Disengaged from the quantity of inferior work which now
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_18:0.0000:obscures them, the best poems of Wordsworth, I hear many
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_19:0.0000:people say, would indeed stand out in great beauty, but they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_20:0.0000:would prove to be very few in number, scarcely more than half-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_21:0.0250:a-dozen. I maintain, on the other hand, that what strikes me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_22:0.0250:with admiration, what establishes in my opinion Wordsworth's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_23:0.0000:superiority, is the great and ample body of powerful work
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_24:0.0000:which remains to him, even after all his inferior work has been
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_25:0.0500:cleared away. He gives us so much to rest upon, so much
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_26:0.0000:which communicates his spirit and engages ours !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_28:0.0000:single pieces, or of three or four pieces, by each poet, I do not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_29:0.0000:say that Wordsworth would stand decisively above Grey, or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_30:0.0000:Burns, or Coleridge, or Keats, or Manzoni, or Heine. It is in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_31:0.0250:his ampler body of powerful work that I find his superiority.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_32:0.0000:His good work itself, his work which counts, is not all of it, of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0021_33:0.0250:course, of equal value. Some kinds of poetry are in themselves
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_2:0.0000:latter sort, counts, too, sometimes, by its biographical interest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_3:0.0250:partly, not by its poetical interest pure and simple ; but then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_4:0.0250:this can only be "when the poet producing it has the power and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_5:0.0250:importance of Wordsworth, a power and importance which he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_6:0.0000:assuredly did not establish by such didactic poetry alone.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_7:0.0000:Altogether, it is, I say, by the great body of powerful and sig-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_8:0.0000:nificant work which remains to him, after every reduction and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_10:0.0250:proved.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_11:0.0250:To exhibit this body of Wordsworth's best work, to clear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_12:0.0250:away obstructions from around it, and to let it speak for itself,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_13:0.0000:is what every lover of Wordsworth should desire. Until this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_14:0.0000:has been done, Wordsworth, whom we, to whom he is dear, all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_15:0.0000:of us know and feel to be so great a poet, has not had a fair
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_16:0.0000:chance before the world. When once it has been done, he will
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_17:0.0000:make his way best not by our advocacy of him, but by his own
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_18:0.0000:worth and power. We may safely leave him to make his way
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_19:0.0000:thus, we who believe that a superior worth and power in poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_20:0.0000:finds in mankind a sense responsive to it and disposed at last to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_21:0.0250:recognize it. Yet at the outset, before he has been duly known
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_22:0.0000:and recognized, we may do Wordsworth a service, perhaps, in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_23:0.0250:indicating in what his superior power and worth will be found
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_24:0.0250:to consist, and in what it will not.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_25:0.0500:Long ago, in speaking of Homer, I said that the noble and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_26:0.0000:profound application of ideas to life is the most essential part
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_27:0.0250:of poetic greatness. I said that a great poet receives his dis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_28:0.0500:tinctive character of superiority from his application, under the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_29:0.0000:conditions immutably fixed by the laws of poetic beauty and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_30:0.0500:poetic truth, from his application, I say, to his subject, what-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0022_31:0.0000:ever it may be, of the ideas
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_0:0.0500:ESSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 19
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_4:0.0000:Voltaire, with his signal acuteness, most truly remarked that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_5:0.0500:" no nation has treated in poetry moral ideas with more energy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_6:0.0000:and depth than the English nation." And he adds : " There,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_7:0.0250:it seems to me, is the great merit of the English poets." Vol-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_8:0.0000:taire does not mean, by " treating in poetry moral ideas," the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_9:0.0000:composing moral and didactic poems : that brings us but a very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_10:0.0000:little way in poetry. He means just the same thing as was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_11:0.0000:meant when I spoke above " of the noble and profound appli-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_12:0.0000:cation of ideas to life ; " and he means the application of these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_13:0.0000:ideas under the conditions fixed for us by the laws of poetic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_14:0.0000:beauty and poetic truth. If it is said that to call these ideas
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_15:0.0250:moral ideas it is to introduce a strong and injurious limitation,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_16:0.0000:I answer that it is to do nothing of the kind, because moral
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_17:0.0000:ideas are really so main a part of human life. The question,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_18:0.0000:how to live, is itself a moral idea ; and it is the question which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_19:0.0000:most interests every man, and with which, in some way or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_20:0.0000:other, he is perpetually occupied. A large sense is of course
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_21:0.0000:to be given to the term moral. Whatever bears upon the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_22:0.0250:question, " how to live," comes under it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_25:0.0000:In those few lines, Milton utters, as every one at once per-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0023_26:0.0000:ceives, a moral idea. Yes, but so too, when Keats consoles the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_5:0.0500:Voltaire was right in thinking that the energetic and pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_6:0.0250:found treatment of moral ideas, in this large sense, is what dis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_7:0.0000:tinguishes the English poetry. He sincerely meant praise, not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_8:0.0000:dispraise or hint of limitation ; and they err who suppose that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_9:0.0000:poetic limitation is a necessary consequence of the fact, the fact
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_10:0.0000:being granted as Voltaire states it. If what distinguishes the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_11:0.0000:greatest poets is their powerful and profound application of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_12:0.0000:ideas to life, which surely no good critic will deny, then to pre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_13:0.0000:fix to the term ideas here the term moral makes hardly any
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_14:0.0250:difference, because human life itself is in so preponderating a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_15:0.0000:degree moral.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_16:0.0250:It is important, therefore, to hold fast to this : that poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_17:0.0000:is at bottom a criticism of life ; that the greatness of a poet lies
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_18:0.0000:in a powerful and beautiful application of ideas 'to life, to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_19:0.0250:question : How to live. Morals are often treated in a narrow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_20:0.0000:and false fashion, they are bound up with systems of thought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_21:0.0000:and belief which have had their day, they are fallen into the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_22:0.0000:hands of pedants and professional dealers, they grow tiresome
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_23:0.0000:to some of us. We find attraction, at times, even in a poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_24:0.0000:of revolt against them ; in a poetry which might take for its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_25:0.0000:motto Omar Kheyam's words : " Let us make up in the tavern
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_26:0.0000:for the time which we have wasted in the mosque." Or we find
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_27:0.0000:attractions in a poetry indifferent to them, in a poetry where the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_28:0.0000:contents may be what they will, but where the form is studied
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_29:0.0000:and exquisite. We delude ourselves in either case ; and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_30:0.0000:best cure for our delusion is to let our minds rest ujxm that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_31:0.0250:great and inexhaustible word life, until we learn to enter into
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0024_32:0.0000:its meaning. A poetry of revolt against moral ideas is a poetry

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_1:0.0500:Epictetus had a happy figure for thingvS like the play of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_2:0.0000:senses, or literary form and finish, or argumentative ingenuity,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_3:0.0000:in comparison with " the best and master thing " for us, as he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_4:0.0000:called it, the concern, how to live. Some people were afraid of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_5:0.0000:them, he said, or they disliked and undervalued them. Such
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_6:0.0000:people were wrong ; they were unthankful or cowardly. But
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_7:0.0000:the things might also be over-prized, and treated as final when
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_8:0.0000:they are not. They bear to life the relation which iuns bear to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_9:0.0000:home. " As if a man, journejdng home, and finding a nice inn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_10:0.0000:on the road, and liking it, were to stay for ever at the inn !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_11:0.0000:Man, thou hast forgotten thine object ; thy journey was not to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_12:0.0000:this but through this. ' But this inn is taking.' And how
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_13:0.0000:many other inns, too, are taking, and how many fields and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_14:0.0000:meadows ! but as places of passage merely. You have an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_15:0.0000:object, which is this : to get home, to do your duty to your
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_16:0.0000:family, friends, and fellow-countrymen, to attain inward free-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_17:0.0000:dom, serenity, happiness, contentment. Style takes your fancy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_18:0.0000:arguing takes your fancy, and you forget your home and want
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_19:0.0000:to make your abode with them and to stay with them, on the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_20:0.0000:plea that they are taking. Who denies that they are taking ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_21:0.0000:but as places of passage, as inns. And when I say this, you
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_22:0.0000:suppose me to be attacking the care for style, the care for ai'gu-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_23:0.0000:ment. I am not ; I attack the resting in them, the not looking
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_25:0.0500:Now, when we come across a poet like Th^ophile Gautier, we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_26:0.0000:have a poet who has taken up his abode at an inn, and never
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_27:0.0000:got farther. There may be inducements to this or that one of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_28:0.0000:us, at this or that moment, to find deligbt in him, to cleave to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_29:0.0000:him ; but after all, we do not change the truth about him, we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_30:0.0000:only stay ourselves in. his inn along with him. And when we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0025_31:0.0500:come across a poet like Wordsworth, who sings,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_4:0.0000:and who prosecutes his journey home. We say, for brevity's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_5:0.0000:sake, that he deals with life, because he deals with that in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_6:0.0000:which life really consists. This is what Voltaire means to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_7:0.0250:praise in the English poets, this dealing with what is really
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_8:0.0000:life. But always it is the mark of the greatest poets that they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_9:0.0250:deal with it ; and to say that the English poets are remarkable
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_10:0.0000:for dealing with it, is only another way of saying, what is true,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_13:0.0250:Wordsworth deals with it, and his greatness lies in his deal-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_14:0.0250:ing with it so powerfully. I have named a number of cele-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_15:0.0000:brated poets above all of whom he, in my opinion, deserves to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_16:0.0250:be placed. He is to be placed above poets like Voltaire, Dry-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_17:0.0250:den, Pope, Lessing, Schiller, because these famous personages,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_18:0.0000:with a thousand gifts and merits, never, or scarcely ever, attain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_23:0.0000:list, have this accent ; who can doubt it ? And at the same
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_24:0.0000:time they have treasures of humour, felicity, passion, for which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_25:0.0250:in Wordsworth we shall look in vain. Where, then, is Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_26:0.0250:worth's superiority ? It is here ; he deals with more of life
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0026_27:0.0500:than they do ; he deals with life, as a whole, more powerfully.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_1:0.0000:ideas which " fall spontaneously into a scientific system of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_2:0.0000:thought." But we must be on our guard against the Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_3:0.0000:worthians, if we want to secure for Wordsworth his due rank
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_4:0.0000:as a poet. The Wordsworthians are apt to praise him for the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_5:0.0000:wrong things, and to lay far too much stress upon what they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_6:0.0250:call his philosophy. His poetry is the reality, his philosophy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_8:0.0000:scientific system of thought," and the more that it puts them
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_9:0.0000:on, is the illusion. Perhaps we shall one day learn to make
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_10:0.0000:this proposition general, and to say : Poetry is the reality,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_11:0.0000:philosophy the illusion. But in Wordsworth's case, at any
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_12:0.0250:rate, we cannot do him justice until we dismiss his formal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_13:0.0500:poilosophy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_14:0.0500:The Excursion abounds with philosophy, and therefore the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_15:0.0500:Excursion is to the Words worthian what it never can be to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_16:0.0000:disinterested lover of poetry, a satisfactory work, "Duty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_17:0.0250:exists," says Wordsworth, in the Excursion ; and then he pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_24:0.0500:sweet union of philosophy and poetry. But the disinterested
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_25:0.0500:lover of poetry will feel that the lines carry us really not a step
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_26:0.0000:farther than the proposition which they would interpret ; that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_27:0.0250:they are a tissue of elevated but abstract verbiage, alien to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0027_28:0.0000:very nature of poetry.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_10:0.0000:philosophic doctrine; and the attached Words w or thian loves
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_11:0.0000:passages of such doctrine, and brings them forward in proof of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_12:0.0250:his poet's excellence. But however true, the doctrine may be,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_13:0.0250:it has, as here presented, none of the characters of poetic truth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_14:0.0250:the kind of truth which we require from a poet, and in which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_17:0.0250:stones of the supposed philosophic system of Wordsworth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_18:0.0250:the idea of tne high instincts and affections coming out in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_19:0.0000:childhood, testifying of a divine home recently left, and fading
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_20:0.0000:away as our life proceeds, this idea, of undeniable beauty as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_21:0.0000:a play of fancy, has itself not the character of poetic truth of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_22:0.0000:the best kind ; it has no real solidity. The instinct of delight
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_23:0.0000:in Nature and her beauty had no doubt extraordinary strength
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_24:0.0000:in Wordsworth himself as a child. But to say that universally
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_25:0.0000:this instinct is mighty in childhood, and tends to die away
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_26:0.0000:afterwards, is to say what is extremely doubtful. In many
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_27:0.0000:people, perphaps with the majority of educated persons, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_28:0.0000:love of nature is nearly imperceptible at ten years old, but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_29:0.0250:strong and operative at thirty. In general we may say of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_30:0.0000:these high instincts of early childhood, the base of the alleged
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_31:0.0000:systematic philosophy of Wordsworth, what Thucydides says of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_32:0.0000:the early achievements of the Greek race : " It is impossible
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_33:0.0000:to speak with certainty of what is so remote; but from all that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0028_34:0.0500:we can really investigate, I should say that they were no very

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_15:0.0000:these un- Voltairian lines must have been imposed on him as a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_16:0.0000:judgment ! One can hear them being quoted at a Social
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_17:0.0250:Science Congress ; one can call up the whole scene. A great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_18:0.0000:room in one of our dismal provincial towns ; dusty air and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_19:0.0000:jaded afternoon daylight ; benches fall of men with bald heads
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_20:0.0000:and women in spectacles ; an orator lifting up his face from a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_21:0.0000:manuscript written within and without to declaim these lines
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_22:0.0000:of Wordsworth ; and in the soul of any poor child of nature
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_23:0.0000:who may have wandered in thither, an unutterable sense of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_24:0.0000:lamentation, and mourning, and woe !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_25:0.0500:" But turn we," as Wordsworth says, " from these bold, bad
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_26:0.0000:men," the haunters of Social Science Congresses. And let us
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_27:0.0250:be on our guard, too, against the exhibitors and extollers of a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_28:0.0000:"scientific system of thought" in Wordsworth's poetry. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_29:0.0000:poetry will never be seen aright while they thus exhibit it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_30:0.0000:The cause of its greatness is simple, and may be told quite
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_31:0.0000:simply. Wordsworth's poetry is great because of the extra-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_32:0.0000:ordinary power with which Wordsworth feels the joy offered to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_33:0.0000:us in nature, the joy offered to us in the simple primary
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0029_34:0.0000:affections and duties ; and because of the extraordinary power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_12:0.0000:Nevertheless, we are not to suppose that everything is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_13:0.0000:precious which Wordsworth, standing even at this perennial
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_14:0.0000:and beautiful source, may give us. Wordsworthians are apt
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_15:0.0000:to talk as if it must be. They will speak with the same
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_16:0.0500:reverence of Tfie Sailor's Mother, for example, as of Lucy Gray.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_17:0.0500:They do their master harm by such lack of discrimination.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_18:0.0000:Lucy Gray is a beautiful success; The Sailor's Mother is a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_19:0.0250:failure. To give aright what he wishes to give, to interpret
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_20:0.0000:and render successfully, is not always within Wordsworth's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_21:0.0000:own command. It is within no poet's command ; here is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_22:0.0250:part of the Muse, the inspiration, the God, the "not ourselves."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_23:0.0000:In Word worth's case, the accident, for so it may almost be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_24:0.0000:called, of inspiration, is of peculiar importance. No poet,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_25:0.0000:perhaps, is so evidently filled with a new and sacred energy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_26:0.0000:when the inspiration is upon him; no poet, when it fails him,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_27:0.0000:is so left " weak as is a breaking wave." I remember hearing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_28:0.0000:him say that " Goethe's poetry was not inevitable enough/'
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_29:0.0000:The remark is striking and true ; no line in Goethe, as Goethe
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_30:0.0000:said himself, but its maker knew well how it came there.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_31:0.0000:Wordsworth is right, Goethe's poetry is not inevitable; not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_32:0.0250:inevitable enough. But Wordsworth's poetry, when he is at
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0030_33:0.0000:hia best, is inevitable, as inevitable as Nature herself. It
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_0:0.0500:ESSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 27
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_1:0.0500:might seem that Nature not only gave him the matter for his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_2:0.0250:poem, but wrote his poem for him. He has no style. He was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_3:0.0000:too conversant with Milton not to catch at times his master's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_4:0.0000:manner, and he has fine Miltonic lines; but he has no assured
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_5:0.0000:poetic style of his own, like Milton. When he seeks to have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_6:0.0000:a style he falls into ponderosity and pomposity. In the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_7:0.0000:Excursion we have his style, as an artistic product of his own
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_8:0.0000:creation; and although Jeffrey completely failed to recognise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_9:0.0000:Wordsworth's real greatness, he was yet not wrong in saying
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_10:0.0000:of the Excursion, as a work of poetic style : " This will never
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_11:0.0250:do." And yet magical as is that power, which Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_13:0.0250:which is an equivalent for it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_21:0.0500:of Milton. It is the incomparable charm of Milton's power of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_22:0.0000:poetic style which gives such worth to Paradise Regained, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_23:0.0000:makes a great poem of ri, work in which Milton's imagination
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_25:0.0500:and at command, no style of this kind ; but he had too poetic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_26:0.0000:a nature, and had read the great poets too well, not to catch,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_27:0.0000:as I have already remarked, something of it occasionallv. We
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0031_28:0.0250:find it not only in his Miltonic lines; we find it in such a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_2:0.0000:undeniable, is more properly that of eloquent prose than the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_3:0.0250:subtle heightening and change wrought by genuine poetic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_4:0.0000:style. It is style, again, and the elevation given by style,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_5:0.0000:which chiefly makes the effectiveness of Laodameia,. Still the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_6:0.0250:right sort of verse to choose from Wordsworth, if we are to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_23:0.0500:and if Wordsworth did great things with this nobly plain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_25:0.0500:always have been forward to acknowledge, that Burns used it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_28:0.0000:unmatchable. Nature herself seems, I say, to take the pen
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_29:0.0000:out of his hand, and to write for him with her own bare, sheer ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_30:0.0000:penetrating power. This arises from two causes ; from the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_31:0.0250:profound sincereness with which Wordsworth feels his subject,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0032_32:0.0500:and also from the profoundly sincere and natural character of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_0:0.0500:KSSAY ON WORDSWORTH. 2.J
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_1:0.0250:his subject itself. He can and will treat such a subject with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_2:0.0250:nothing but the most plain, first-hand, almost austere natural-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_3:0.0250:ness. His expression may often be called bald, as, for instance,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_4:0.0000:in the poem of Resolution and Independence ; but it is bald as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_8:0.0000:worth, of profound truth of subject with profound truth of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_9:0.0000:execution, he is unique. His best poems are those which most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_10:0.0000:perfectly exhibit this balance. I have a warm admiration for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_11:0.0000:Laodameia and for the great Ode; but if I am to tell the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_12:0.0500:very truth, I find Laodameia not wholly free from something
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_13:0.0000:artifical, and the great Ode not wholly free from something
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_14:0.0000:declamatory. If I had to pick out poems of a kind most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_15:0.0000:perfectly to show Wordsworth's unique power, I should rather
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_16:0.0000:choose poems such as Michael, The Fountain, The High' and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_17:0.0500:Heaper. And poems with the peculiar and unique beauty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_18:0.0000:which distinguishes these, Wordsworth produced in considerable
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_19:0.0000:number; besides very many other poems of which the worth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_20:0.0500:although not so rare as the worth of these, is still exceedingly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_23:0.0000:Wordsworth eminent by reason of the goodness of his best
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_24:0.0000:work, but he is eminent also by reason of the great body of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_25:0.0000:good work which he has left to us. With the ancients I will
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_26:0.0000:not compare; him. In many respects the ancients are far above
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_27:0.0000:us, and yet there is something that we demand which they can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_28:0.0000:never give. Leaving the ancients, let us come to the poets and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_29:0.0250:poetry of Christendom. Dante, Shakespeare, Moliere, Milton,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_30:0.0000:Goethe, are altogether larger and more splendid luminaries in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_31:0.0000:the poetical heaven than Wordsworth. But I know not where
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0033_32:0.0000:else, among the moderns, we are to find his superiors.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_2:0.0000:which in Wordsworth's poems is interesting. Except in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_3:0.0250:case of Margaret, a story composed separately from the rest of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_4:0.0250:the Excursion, and which belongs to a different part of England,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_5:0.0000:I have not ventured on detaching portions of poems, or on giving
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_6:0.0250:any piece otherwise than as Wordsworth himself gave it. But,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_7:0.0000:under the conditions imposed by this reserve, the volume con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_8:0.0000:tains, I think, everything, or nearly everything, which may best
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_9:0.0250:serve him with the majority of lovers of poetry, nothing which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_10:0.0250:may disserve him.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_11:0.0000:I have spoken lightly of Wordsworthians : and if we are to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_12:0.0250:get Wordsworth recognised by the public and by the world, we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_13:0.0000:must recommend him not in the spirit of a clique, but in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_14:0.0000:spirit of disinterested lovers of poetry. But I am a Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_15:0.0000:worthian myself. I can read with pleasure and edification
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_16:0.0000:Peter Bell, and the whole series of Ecclesiastical Sonnets, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_17:0.0000:the address to Mr. Wilkinson's spade, and even the Thanksgiving
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_18:0.0250:Ode ; everything of Wordsworth, I think, except Vaudracour
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_19:0.0000:and Julia. It is not for nothing that one has been brought up
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_20:0.0250:in the veneration of a man so truly worthy of homage ; that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_21:0.0250:one ha& seen him and heard him, lived in his neighbourhood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_22:0.0000:and been familiar with his country. No Wordsworthian has a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_23:0.0000:tenderer affection for this pure and sage master than I, or is less
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_24:0.0000:really offended by his defects. But Wordsworth is something
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_25:0.0000:more than the pure and sage master of a small band of devoted
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_26:0.0000:followers, and we ought not to rest satisfied until he is seen to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_27:0.0000:be what he is. He is one of the very chief glories of English
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_28:0.0000:Poetry ; and by nothing is England so glorious as by her poetry ^
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_29:0.0250:Let us lay aside every weight which hinders our getting him
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_30:0.0000:recognised as this, and let our one study be to bring to pass, as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_31:0.0000:widely as possible and as truly as possible, his own word con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_32:0.0000:cerning his poems : " They will co-operate with the benign
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_33:0.0250:tendencies in human nature and society, and will, in their
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0034_34:0.0000:degree, be efficacious in making men wiser, better, and happier."

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_4:0.0000:his works, some dominant and central idea has given unity to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_5:0.0000:them all and made them, as one may say, a single song of many
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_6:0.0000:notes. Milton's trumpet- voice proclaims the power and sub-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_7:0.0000:limity of the spirit world as conceived by the Puritan imagina-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_8:0.0250:tion ; Pope asserts the superiority of reason as man's governing

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_12:0.0000:scorning any single truth, has taught us above all things to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_13:0.0000:know the world rather than to judge it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_14:0.0500:In fiction, also, this singleness of purpose has marked the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_15:0.0000:efforts of our greatest novelists. Scott revived chivalry : he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_16:0.0000:exerted his wonderful gift of historic imagination to show us
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_17:0.0000:"the storied past v ; Dickens taught us the beauty and power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_18:0.0000:of a warm and loving heart, the sweetness of cheerfulness and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_19:0.0000:sentiment ; Thackeray satirized all who make pretences, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_20:0.0000:exhibited the folly and meanness of sham and deceit ; George
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_21:0.0000:Eliot was imbued with the importance of human life, and made
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_22:0.0000:us feel that it is as important in one class of society as in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_23:0.0250:another.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_24:0.0500:Many gifted writers have failed to be great because they have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_25:0.0000:failed to grasp any great central idea to give forth as a new and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_26:0.0000:important truth for humanity. Many writers, on the other
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_27:0.0000:hand, have grasped truths of the highest value, and grasped
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_28:0.0250:them with wonderful power and originality, and yet, because of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_29:0.0000:the want of artistic gifts, have failed to give us beautiful literary
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0153_30:0.0250:works. Carlyle with his lesson of hard work and sincere work
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_2:0.0250:expression ; Emerson's great truth that the broadest view of a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_6:0.0250:The originality and importance to humanity of an author's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_7:0.0250:great dominant idea, together with his gift of conveying that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_8:0.0250:idea in a powerful form, go a long way toward making his rank
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_9:0.0250:and influence. Gray's idea that the villagers sleeping peace-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_10:0.0000:fully in their narrow cells under the twilight shadows of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_11:0.0000:churchyard at Stoke were worth writing beautifully about, has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_12:0.0500:been considered so great an idea that Gray is a great poet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_19:0.0000:But, while a little work on such a truth has made such
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_20:0.0000:names as Gray and Burns, all the art of a Longfellow has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_21:0.0250:failed to make an equal fame where no such powerful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_22:0.0250:mission was felt, it is only when we find the great teacher and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_26:0.0250:equal to that of poets like Shelley and Swinburne ; when he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_27:0.0000:first claimed attention for his verses he was sneered at as no
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_28:0.0000:gifted artist, however scanty his thought, is ever sneered at;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_29:0.0000:and yet he is reckoned among our first poets by a great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_30:0.0000:majority of capable critics. Some rank him among the first
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_31:0.0000:three, some among the first five ; a few still sneer at his claims.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_32:0.0250:Of his rank we shall speak again, but it must be certain that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0154_33:0.0000:the great mission of this poet has appealed profoundly to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_0:0.0500:MEMOIR. 139
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_3:0.0000:If one were asked what subjects literature may deal with, one
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_4:0.0000:might conclude roughly that humanity and nature and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_5:0.0000:unseen loorld would cover the whole ground. Shakespeare has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_6:0.0000:gone a long way toward covering all this ground, but he has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_7:0.0000:certainly made human nature his own particular subject.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_8:0.0000:Milton has told us of the invisible powers, and his name is in a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_9:0.0000:sense identified with that division of the literary field. Now,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_10:0.0000:it would seem that until Wordsworth came the otter part of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_11:0.0000:field had never been appropriated, and he made it his own.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_12:0.0000:Milton tells us to look within us and above for light and guid-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_13:0.0000:ance ; our path is that of Christian, we must keep our eye
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_14:0.0000:upon the end of the narrow way ; Shakespeare tells us to look
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_15:0.0000:around us, to know our fellow-man, his actions and his motives \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_16:0.0000:to learn how to live rather than how to die ; our path is among
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_17:0.0000:men, our duty to our Creator is our duty to those among
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_18:0.0250:whom He has placed us. But Wordsworth tells us to look for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_19:0.0000:the image of our Maker in the grass, the rocks, the starlit
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_20:0.0000:water; the daisy, the skylark, the innocent hart, are our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_21:0.0000:examples because they draw their joy and peace from the source
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_22:0.0000:of it, and our wisdom is to see that the simple living of thsse
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_23:0.0000:is our guide to present and eternal happiness j our path is not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_24:0.0000:among men so much as among the hills, the valleys, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_25:0.0000:meadows, along the streams, under the open sky of heaven.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_26:0.0000:Milton was a man of books, Shakespeare was a man of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_27:0.0000:world, Wordsworth was neither. Milton was a man of strong
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_28:0.0250:ecclesiastical and scholastic opinions, Shakespeare has ex-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_30:0.0000:of Nature herself.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0155_34:0.0250:power and success that no other poet has ever been thought of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_2:0.0000:scholastic and ecclesiastical turn of mind hold concerning the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_3:0.0000:unseen world may be found in the Paradise Lost and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_4:0.0000:Paradise Regained. All that men think about each other (and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_5:0.0000:much more) may be found in Shakespeare's Plays. All our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_6:0.0000:tenderness for flowers, birds and natural objects generally is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_7:0.0000:voiced in Wordsworth, he tells us our ideal relation to nature,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_8:0.0000:we are to love nature and to learn from her. Nature teaches
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_9:0.0000:us peace, happiness and duty. The stars in their orbits are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_10:0.0250:young and strong through obeying the law of their nature ; if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_11:0.0000:we obey the law of our nature we shall be young and strong
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_12:0.0250:always. If the stars could break the law ruin would result.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_13:0.0000:Duty, then, is our guide, but though our guide not our task-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_14:0.0000:master ; we are to regard the law of duty as the law of perfect
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_15:0.0250:liberty ; liberty is the right to do right to obey duty ; the right
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_16:0.0000:to do wrong is mere license. Liberty brings peace and happiness,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_17:0.0000:even a bright wholesome joy, but not pleasure. Pleasure is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_18:0.0000:something to be feared, it is unknown to the flower, and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_19:0.0000:bird, and the star. Joy is the highest state of happiness that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_20:0.0250:brings no reaction, no misery or depression ; pleasure is to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_21:0.0000:shunned, it brings depression, remorse, decay.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_22:0.0000:It will be seen that the poet is not so much the poet who
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_23:0.0250:glorifies nature as the poet who interprets man's relation to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_24:0.0000:nature. No more striking lesson could be had than to contrast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_25:0.0250:Shelley's verses about the skylark with Wordsworth's. Shelley's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_26:0.0250:song is indeed " harmonious madness," tremendous, wild and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_27:0.0000:passionate ; Wordsworth's song is far more passionate than is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_28:0.0000:usual with him, indeed, it may be said to reach the highest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0156_29:0.0250:pitch of lyrical enthusiasm he permits himself, yet it ends thus :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_3:0.0250:We have purposely said nothing of Wordsworth's life up to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_4:0.0250:this point. It is not uncommon in memoirs to see such expres
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_5:0.0250:sions as these : "an uneventful career," " a quiet and uninter-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_6:0.0000:esting life." Frankly then our poet never was a poacher, he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_7:0.0000:never tramped through Europe supporting himself by playing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_8:0.0000:a flute, he did not lead a band of disorderly Suliotes in the war
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_9:0.0000:of Greek Independence, nor was he drowned from a yacht at
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_10:0.0000:the age of thirty. No such amusing, exciting, or tragic tales
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_11:0.0000:are told of him. Nor had he any remarkabl e eccentricities to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_12:0.0000:endear him to the reader ; he did not quarrel with his wife,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_13:0.0000:nor keep a pet bear, nor eat like a savage, nor drink tea ex
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_14:0.0000:cessively, nor ruin himself with opium ; he did not commit
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_15:0.0000:suicide, nor die of a broken heart, nor at an early age. On
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_16:0.0000:the other hand he was a quiet, kindly, well-balanced man, of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_17:0.0000:excellent habits and character; he lived in peace with all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_18:0.0000:men, was a good neighbour and citizen, and through eighty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_19:0.0000:long years kept plodding on cheerfully till his day was done.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_20:0.0000:Not an eventful life in the common sense of the term ; not an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_21:0.0250:interesting life if one compare it with the life of a fiction-hero
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_23:0.0500:inant truth of book and life was that all morbid excitement,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_24:0.0000:all passion, whether of pleasure or grief, is unmanly, undutiful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_25:0.0000:and evil ; he would have condemned no great tragic story if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_26:0.0000:true and natural, but the morbid desire for all undue excite-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_27:0.0000:ment was in his eyes the great evil of the world. He is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_28:0.0000:antithesis of Byron, he is the antithesis of Daudet and de
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_29:0.0000:Maupassant, he is the antithesis of cynicism and pessimism
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_30:0.0000:and of everything that destroys hope, and prevents effort, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_31:0.0000:paralyzes faith and love and health. No blast heart will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_32:0.0000:stimulated into an hour's attention by his pen ; no eye that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_33:0.0000:cannot, with Carlyle see the fifth act of a tragedy in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0157_34:0.0250:death of every peasant, and weep over the field-mouse and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_1:0.0250:uprooted daisy with Burns, will see what this poet has to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_2:0.0000:show. But let no rash critic conclude that what he has no
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_3:0.0000:eyes to see has no visible existence. There are thousands. of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_4:0.0250:" Wordsworth ians " and tens of thousands who feel that life is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_5:0.0000:better worth living, and plodding less irksome, and simplicity
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_6:0.0500:more charming, because Wordsworth lived uneventfully and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_7:0.0000:plodded cheerfully-, and despised luxury. Surely the best that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_8:0.0000:any poet can do is to make millions of people regard their
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_9:0.0000:daily commonplace existence as being beautiful and worthy of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_10:0.0000:them and even ideal : and surely the worst any writer can do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_12:0.0500:wretched, envious, discontented, hopeless.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_13:0.0250:Had Wordsworth been of the latter class he might more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_17:0.0500:might wisely envy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_19:0.0000:1770, Wordsworth was born. His father, an attorney, was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_20:0.0250:law-agent to the Earl of Lonsdale. Both parents were of good
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_21:0.0000:birth and education, both were wise, refined and capable. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_22:0.0250:mother died leaving her boy only eight years of age, very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_23:0.0000:young to be motherless, but not too young to have got a strong
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_24:0.0000:impress of her love and wisdom. He received his earliest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_25:0.0000:lessons at a dame-school in Penrith ; at nine he was sent to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_26:0.0000:Hawkeshead Grammar School in Lancashire ; at seventeen, to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_27:0.0000:St. John's College, Cambridge. He was graduated Bachelor of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_28:0.0000:Arts in 1791, about a century ago. The year before, he had
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_29:0.0000:travelled in Europe with a College friend, Jones, and after his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_30:0.0000:graduation he went to France, where he remained about a year-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_31:0.0000:and-a-half, studying the French language, which he mastered
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_32:0.0000:thoroughly, and the political situation of those stirring times.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0158_33:0.0500:At first he was an ardent Republican, but disgusted with the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_3:0.0500:Though poor, he had relatives who made him an allowance
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_4:0.0250:on which he could live. His friends wished him to study for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_5:0.0250:holy orders, but he felt a strong desire to live by writing, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_6:0.0000:soon published a small volume of verse. A friend, Raisley
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_7:0.0000:Calvert, for whom he felt a profound attachment, died after a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_8:0.0000:lingering illness, in which Wordsworth had shown much de-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_9:0.0000:votion to him. Galvert having great faith in the young poet's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_10:0.0000:genius left him 900, to enable him to follow literature without
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_11:0.0500:depending upon his relatives.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_13:0.0000:young poets formed a strong friendship. They agreed to write
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_14:0.0000:a book of poems together, Coleridge to write about the super-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_15:0.0000:natural, and Wordsworth to lend the charm of f poetry to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_16:0.0000:commonplace objects. This book appeared in '98 and contained
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_17:0.0000:"The Ancient Mariner," a ballad so powerful in presenting the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_18:0.0000:strong reality of the invisible world that it carries more con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_19:0.0000:viction of the existence of unseen and spiritual forces than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_20:0.0000:even Milton's sublime works. The book (Lyrical Ballads,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_21:0.0000:Vol. I.) was a flat failure however, and Wordsworth's part of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_22:0.0500:it was much reviled by the critics.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_23:0.0500:After its publication the poets and Wordsworth's sister went
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_24:0.0000:to Germany to study. This visit to the continent had a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_25:0.0250:striking influence upon Coleridge but Wor< Is worth returned
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_26:0.0000:without any strong marks of German culture. On his return
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_27:0.0250:to England in 1799, he settled down to live in seclusion as a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_28:0.0250:poet-philosopher. He always lived near the English lakes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_29:0.0000:though in three or four different spots. In 1813, he went to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_30:0.0500:Rydal Mount, the residence most famously associated with his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0161_31:0.0250:name.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_2:0.0000:two he was married to his own cousin, Mary Hutchinson, with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_3:0.0000:whom as a child he had gone to school and played at Penrith.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_4:0.0000:Their union was most happy. In his verses he often refers to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_5:0.0000:her kindness and wisdom ; there were five children, of whom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_6:0.0000:the father was very fond, some of his sweetest verses describe
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_7:0.0000:his daughters. In 1813 he got a Government appointment as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_8:0.0000:Distributor of Stamps for Cumberland and Westmoreland ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_9:0.0000:this brought him about .500 a year, and the work was done
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_10:0.0000:by a deputy. In 1827 Sir George Beaumont, friend and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_11:0.0250:patron of Wordsworth, died, leaving him 100 a year as a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_13:0.0500:Wordsworth worked steadily away with little encourage-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_14:0.0500:ment except from a circle of cultivated friends such as Cole-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_15:0.0000:ridge, Sou they, De Quincey, and Arnold of Rugby, until about
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_16:0.0250:1839, when he got more recognition. In 1840, he was pen-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_17:0.0500:sioned by Sir Robert Peel, ^the minister who never read
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_18:0.0000:poetry) receiving ,300 yearly. In 1843 he was offered the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_19:0.0000:honour of Poet Laureate upon the death of Southey ; he declined
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_20:0.0000:the post because of his great age, but, being assured that no
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_21:0.0000:duties would be required of him, that the Queen heartily
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_22:0.0000:approved of his appointment, and that she could select for the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_23:0.0000:place " no one whose claims for respect and honour on account
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_24:0.0000:of eminence as a poet" could be placed in competition with his,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_25:0.0500:he withdrew his objections and honoured the English laurel by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0162_26:0.0000:wearing it for his few remaining years.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0165_4:0.0000:organs, attitude, manners : moreover, they speah after their own characters,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0165_5:0.0000:not ours ; they speak to us, and we listen with surprise to what they say.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0165_6:0.0000:Indeed I doubt if the best poet has yet written any fiue-act play that can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0165_7:0.0000:compare in thoroughness of invention with the unwritten play in five
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0165_8:0.0250:acts, composed by the dullest snorer on the floor of thr> watch-house."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_0:0.0000:CHAPTER II.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_1:0.0500:THE DEFINITION OP POETRY.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_2:0.0250:When students begin to study Botany or Hydrostatics they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_3:0.0250:naturally inquire for the definition of Botany or Hydrostatics
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_4:0.0250:so that they may grasp the meaning and aims of the new
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_5:0.0000:subject and its province of investigation; but every student
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_6:0.0000:begins the study of poetry with a more or less definite under-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_7:0.0000:standing of what a poem is, hence the formal definition of poem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_8:0.0000:and poetry are usually passed over withoiit direct notice. If,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_9:0.0000:however, a more scientific mind should ask What is poetry ? or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_10:0.0000:What are the characteristic marks of' a poem ? it is probable that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_11:0.0000:the question would meet with so great a variety of .replies as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_15:0.0250:rigid definition of a poem j nature tells her favoured few when
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_16:0.0000:they find the true metal and they do not care to divulge the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_17:0.0000:secret nor to publish any tests by which less favoured readers
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_18:0.0250:may attempt the assay. But it is fairly certain that careful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_19:0.0000:and even scientific scrutiny, with assaying tests and formulae,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_20:0.0000:do not lessen but increase our knowledge of poetry and our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_21:0.0250:delight in it ; it is also well known that many of our greatest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_22:0.0000:poets, notably Wordsworth, have written learned essays upon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_23:0.0000:the scientific aspects of their art and upon these grounds we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_24:0.0250:may conclude that the hazy and indolent view which urges us
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_25:0.0000:not to attempt close observations for the sake of definition is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_26:0.0500:merely a labour-saving caprice of those who would be critics
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_27:0.0000:without canons of criticism, and oracles without the authoritv
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_28:0.0000:of unquestioned knowledge. If then we err in attempting a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0167_29:0.0000:scientific definition of poetry we err under the protection of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_1:0.0000:such writers as Aristotle, Horace, Pope, Wordsworth, Goethe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_2:0.0250:Schiller, Ruskin, Poe, Swinburne, Matthew Arnold and a legion
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_5:0.0000:to be defined in the genus or family to which it belongs. We
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_6:0.0000:have no difficulty in ascertaining that a poem is a work of art.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_7:0.0250:Poems are one species of this genus, while pictures, musical
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_8:0.0250:pieces, pieces of statuary and of architecture are other species
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_9:0.0000:of the same large group. We know that a fine art is a method
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_10:0.0000:of appealing to the soul through the senses, as painting through
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_11:0.0000:the eye, and music through the ear ; our inquiry then leads us
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_12:0.0000:to seek for the special mark or test which differentiates the art
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_13:0.0000:of poetry from the other fine-arts. We see at once that in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_14:0.0000:means used there is a decided difference between any two arts.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_15:0.0250:Music uses combinations of sounds to arouse our thoughts and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_16:0.0000:feelings ; painting uses colours, lights and shadows ; sculpture
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_17:0.0250:uses marble and differs from painting in using the white solid
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_20:0.0250:that we doubt whether we should call it an art ; it uses words
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_21:0.0500:for its material and at first they seem to appeal to none of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_22:0.0500:senses. Of course we see printed words and they appeal, as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_23:0.0500:bits of printing, to the eye, but unless the printing is very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_25:0.0250:appeal to the eye. Take for example the lines :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0168_33:0.0500:power as symbols of ideas, rouse in the mind's eye a picture of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_1:0.0000:the gilded vessel against the azure sea, of gay mariners and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_2:0.0000:reckless captain, the lines become as truly a work of art as if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_3:0.0000:the same picture were raised by colours skilfully spread on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_4:0.0000:canvas. After all it is not the eye which sees but the mind, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_5:0.0250:though the pictures of words undoubtedly requite more activity
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_6:0.0000:of the sensuous imagination than the pictures of paint, they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_7:0.0000:are as truly (and probably in highly imaginative minds as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_8:0.0000:vividly) visible, as the most powerful painting. How power-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_9:0.0000:fully is this claim of poetry to be ranked among the arts, set
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_10:0.0000:fin 111 by the actors when they represent the words of the poet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_11:0.0000:on the stage ; what single other art can then vie with the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_12:0.0000:art of wouds in powerful and comprehensive mastery of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_13:0.0000:human faculties; now every art is tributary, the hero is a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_14:0.0250:statue, a painting, the scene is. a triumph of architecture, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_15:0.0000:uTand rhythm of the metre, if it be a masterpiece by our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_16:0.0250:greatest poet, is more thrilling and moving than the tones of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_19:0.0000:to the soul of man which uses words as its medium of com-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_20:0.0000:munication ; but no sooner do we reach this conclusion than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_21:0.0000:we are confronted by the unquestionable fact that our natures
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_22:0.0000:may be deeply stirred by prose and that the definition makes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_23:0.0250:nothing of a well-known distinction which differentiates prose
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_24:0.0000:and poetry. Moreover we have used an expression " appealing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_25:0.0250:to the soul of man " which is so vague and uncertain as to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_26:0.0500:invalidate the definition from a scientific point of view.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_27:0.0250:Neglecting the second objection for the moment let us look
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_28:0.0000:at the first. It cannot be doubted that prose is capable of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_29:0.0250:stirring our emotions deeply ; think of the passage in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_30:0.0250:"apology of Socrates" as translated by Jowett, where the great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_31:0.0000:ancient is described as speaking of the trials and sorrows of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_32:0.0000:life; think of Burke's defence of his pension where he speaks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_33:0.0250:of his personal misfortunes ; or of the noble passage in which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0169_34:0.0250:he pays a chivalrous tribute to Marie Antoinette; read again
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_0:0.0500:152 WORDSWORTH
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_2:0.0250:passage on "failure" in The Mystery of Life, read the punish-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_3:0.0000:ment of Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, or the quarrel between
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_4:0.0250:Adam Bede and Domiithorne, the concluding lines of Southey's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_5:0.0250:Life of Nelsort or Irving's sketch of The Pride of the Village, :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_6:0.0000:above all perhaps, read the parts of Carlyle's writings which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_7:0.0500:treat of death and sorrow and then say whether or not prose
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_8:0.0250:is a means of appealing to the soul of man.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_9:0.0250:What then is that mark which enables us to distinguish
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_10:0.0500:poetry from prose 1 In the high and intellectual sense there is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_11:0.0250:none. But though prose at its very height may be said to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_12:0.0000:essentially one with poetry, there is a feeling, contmon to all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_13:0.0000:peoples, that when an author's thoughts and feelings reach so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_14:0.0000:lofty and elevating a pitch as to stir the feelings and thoughts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_15:0.0000:of all other men to whom they may be communicated, they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_16:0.0000:should be expressed in music; hence the most elevated pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_17:0.0000:ductions of the mind have generally been expressed musically
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_18:0.0000:and when even the highest thoughts and emotions are expressed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_19:0.0000:without this beautiful cadence men call the expression poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_20:0.0000:only with a grudging feeling and usually they express a certain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_21:0.0000:disapprobation by calling it merely prose. But, nevertheless
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_22:0.0000:they hold in high honour the writings of men who, lacking the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_23:0.0000:gift of song, have done their best io express their noble
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_24:0.0000:thoughts adequately without it, and many have wished to call
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_25:0.0000:the most powerful prose by the name which is usually reserved
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_26:0.0000:for musical language. Now the ear of the reading public is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_27:0.0000:not so cultivated as it might be, hence they have not called all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_28:0.0000:musical writing of the best thoughts, poetry. Unless there is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_29:0.0000:a music they can easily detect, a very regular cadence or falling
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_30:0.0250:of accents or stress, they do not call the writing musical; hence
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_31:0.0000:they mean by poetry, that means of appealing to the soul of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_32:0.0000:man which uses words arranged in. a regularly musical, or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0170_33:0.0000:metrical way, as its means of communication. Some think
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_3:0.0500:But what is meant by " appealing to the soul " 1 Even the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_4:0.0000:most learned have various views as to the meaning of the word
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_5:0.0000:''soul." Probably however the majority of thoughtful people
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_6:0.0000:use it in the sense of "the immortal part of man." The soul
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_7:0.0250:may include the stronger feelings of love and hate, joy and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_8:0.0000:sorrow, admiration and indignation, love of truth and hatred of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_9:0.0000:the false low and mean ; also the love of right for right's sake
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_10:0.0000:and the hatred of wrong because it is not right ; and the joy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_11:0.0000:and pleasure in symmetry and harmony and activity and life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_12:0.0000:and the grief and pain in the ugly malicious and stolid and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_13:0.0000:dead. When we say soul we may mean everything in us
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_14:0.0250:except the material the body ; but we usually mean the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_15:0.0000:reason, and the better, more refined and elevated emotions. A
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_16:0.0250:soulless person is one who is lacking in these qualities ; a dull,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_17:0.0250:low, unjust, narrow person with no sense of beauty.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_19:0.0500:soul" is so very uncertain a term, the term poetry must be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_21:0.0500:Some of the accepted definitions are so framed as merely to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_25:0.0250:One enthusiastic reader loves Swinburne and thinks that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_26:0.0000:poetry, in the true sense of the word, always appeals to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_27:0.0250:sensuous, love of the beautiful. Another reads Charles Wesley
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_28:0.0000:and is sure, equally, that real poetry is always Employed in con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_29:0.0000:veying ideas of worship, praise and supplication : each may
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_30:0.0000:deride the other reader. A third admires Pope and feels con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_31:0.0250:vinced that any poetry that is merely an appeal to the senses or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_32:0.0000:to the moral fraction of a man is one-sided, to him reason is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_33:0.0000:first and the only real poetry is ratiocinative. " There is no
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0171_34:0.0250:ratiocinative poetry " says Black the novelist, hence Pope is" 110
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_2:0.0000:rhythmical creation of beauty ; its sole arbiter is taste; witli
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_3:0.0250:the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral re-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_4:0.0000:lations; unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_5:0.0000:duty or truth," says Poe : hence verses in which duty and truth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_6:0.0000:are preeminent are not poetry, and Wesley, Havergal, and even
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_7:0.0250:Browning are no poets. These, in spite of great names are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_8:0.0000:but narrow views : the term poetry is but a word and those who
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_9:0.0250:ardently desire to apply it to the works of their favourite
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_10:0.0000:authors should have that simple privilege: at best the definition
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_11:0.0000:of it is but arbitrary. If one were to define a natural species,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_12:0.0000:as horse, none would dispute the application of the term to indi-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_13:0.0000:vidual examples hence the definition, if not easy, is possible ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_14:0.0000:but, in defining poetry the light of a set of verses to be called
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_15:0.0250:a poem is often disputed, hence the impossibility of a satis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_16:0.0250:factory definition of this artificial species.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_17:0.0000:Tfce objection that the expression " appeals to the soul " is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_18:0.0000:vague and indefinite is unanswerable ; its vagueness and in-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_19:0.0000:definiteness arise from infinite difference of opinion as to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_20:0.0000:the meaning of the word " soul " as concerned with poetry.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_21:0.0000:Some of the following definitions are popularly received because
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_22:0.0000:they ignore the word entirely, " Poetry is the concrete ex-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_23:0.0000:pression of emotion," ("concrete" here, means appealing to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_24:0.0250:the sensuous imagination) ; " Poetry is the idealization of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_25:0.0000:tjie commonplace " ; " Poetry is that one of the fine arts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_26:0.0000:which expresses its special powers and character by means of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_27:0.0250:language"; "Poetry is the art which has for its object the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_28:0.0250:creation of intellectual pleasures by means of imaginative and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_29:0.0000:passionate language, and language generally, though not neces-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_30:0.0000:sarily formed in regular numbers " ; or as Macaulay has it,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_31:0.0000:"By poetry we mean the art of employing words in such a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_32:0.0000:manner as to produce illusion upon the imagination the art
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_33:0.0000:of doing by words what the painter does by means of colours";
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0172_34:0.0250:another has it "The language of imagination, or of the emotions,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_3:0.0500:imagination and fancy, and appeals to those powers in others,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_5:0.0500:Emerson's view is original and broad-minded but emphatic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_6:0.0000:as one would expect from his character: "Poetry" says he "is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_7:0.0000:the perpetual endeavour to express the spirit of the thing, to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_8:0.0250:pass the brute body, and search the life and reason which caused
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_9:0.0000:it to exist." Again he says, " the poet discovers that what
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_10:0.0000:men value as substances have a higher value as symbols, that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_11:0.0000:nature is the immense shadow of man." So ingenious, so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_12:0.0000:important and so largely true are these pregnant sentences
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_13:0.0250:that it is profitable to pause and illustrate them. When,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_14:0.0500:Tennyson says in Ulysses :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_18:0.0250:would fail to catch the echo of a deeper meaning ; the des-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_19:0.0500:cription has a high value as a picture of real tangible objects,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0173_29:0.0500:poem. This piece of nature is no less than a symbol of life
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_2:0.0500:of this material world: poetry is that uncommon sense which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_3:0.0250:sees through the material envelope to the intelligent soul which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_4:0.0000:made and animates it ; but poetry does not reject the common
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_5:0.0250:sense view; the greatest poets Shakespeare, Homer, Burns, had
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_6:0.0500:the strongest common sense side by side with the strongest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_7:0.0250:ideality the mere absent-minded idealist is as pitiable as the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_8:0.0500:most stolid Philistine, though not so gross.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_10:0.0000:upon beauty as the sum and end and height of poetry 1 Has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_11:0.0250:poetry truly nothing to do with conscience and truth 1 Every
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_12:0.0000:man has a capacity for being pleased by beautiful things,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_13:0.0250:objects that please him he calls beautiful but whether the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_15:0.0500:utility or goodness it is difficult to say.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_16:0.0250:Few definitions of poetry have been more frequently quoted
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_17:0.0250:with approval than Poe's formula, ".the rhythmical creation of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_18:0.0000:beauty." Similar to this is the dictum of Theodore Watts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_19:0.0250:" absolute poetry is the concrete and artistic expression of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_20:0.0000:human mind in emotional and rhythmical language." These
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_21:0.0000:two critics are prominent exponents of a very large school ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_22:0.0000:Swinburne, Rossetti, Keats and all poets whose chief appeal is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_23:0.0000:to the sensuous imagination hold this belief firmly and some of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_24:0.0250:them have asserted it strenuously. It is important to see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_25:0.0250:clearly that there are two principal views of the Question and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_26:0.0000:it becomes necessary eventually to choose between them, though
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0174_27:0.0500:it never becomes necessary to declare the poets of either school
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_1:0.0250:These are their requirements, but of the " beauty " the " music "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_2:0.0000:and the " emotional power " taste is the sole arbiter ; unless
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_3:0.0000:incidentally poetry has no concern with duty or truth. All
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_4:0.0000:who declare that the aesthetic quality of poetry is its mark and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_5:0.0000:brand hold these views more or less clearly. Good examples of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_6:0.0000:work that satisfies these canons may be seen in -B-ossetti's " The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_7:0.0500:Blessed Damozel " Keats' " Eve of St. Agnes " and a great deal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_18:0.0500:Indeed it would be quite entirely incredible were it not echoed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_19:0.0250:to-day on every side so emphatically and so assiduously that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_20:0.0000:one is apt to be ridiculed for rebelling against it and venturing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_21:0.0000:to assert, however feebly, that vvh itever may be true of Italian
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_22:0.0000:art, or of French art, or of Japanese art, English art always was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_23:0.0000:at its best and seems likely to be at its best most markedly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_24:0.0000:and characteristically, and essentially, emphatically didactic and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_25:0.0000:pointedly moral in tone and spirit : and by this is meant not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_26:0.0000:that duty and truth have merely accidental relations to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_27:0.0000:beautiful and pleasing quality but that they are and constitute
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_28:0.0000:the pleasure of our greatest masterpieces according to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_29:0.0000:judgment of our greatest and wisest men in all ages ; that with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_30:0.0000:us truth and duty are so mingled, blended and unified with our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_31:0.0000:conceptions of the highest beauty, that it is hardly a perversion
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_32:0.0000:of terms to use any one of the three indiscriminately to denote
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_33:0.0000:the highest attitude of the greatest poetry. It is true that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0175_34:0.0000:Ouida has written cleverly to satirize the narrowness of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_1:0.0500:English art, that Poe reviled the notion that poetry could have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_2:0.0000:a well-defined didactic motive, that even Coleridge has warned
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_3:0.0000:us that ethical teaching should not narrow our love of beauty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_4:0.0000:wherever \ve find it: it is no secret that the French literary
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_5:0.0000:critics sneer at our lack of freedom, as they are pleased to call
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_6:0.0000:our wholesome . decency, and that the amorous and military
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_7:0.0250:Italian is puzzled by our hopeless dullness. But while these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_8:0.0000:taunts are frequent no English reader should doubt that our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_9:0.0000:poetry both has been and is didactic and moral, nor should he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_10:0.0000:say that it should be merely aesthetic, while considering that in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_11:0.0000:so doing he would necessarily repudiate Shakespeare, Milton,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_12:0.0000:Wordsworth, and Tennyson who have shown always by examples,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_13:0.0000:and often by precept, that they think poetry at its best must do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_14:0.0000:more than please and that the great poet must do more than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_15:0.0000:charm, and charming in doing more. Who then need be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_16:0.0250:ashamed, who at least of English speech and mind, to say boldly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_17:0.0000:to all comers that, whatever may be true of European poetry or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_18:0.0000:of poetry of the Swinburne and Oscar Wilde type, English
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_19:0.0000:poetry is and ought to be strongly intellectual, powerfully and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_21:0.0250:of these qualities.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_23:0.0000:English school-boy praising English poetry for being melodious
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_24:0.0000:and sensuously beautiful, yet ashamed to say that it is powerfully
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_25:0.0250:thoughtful and morally sublime, while that very boy by reason
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_26:0.0500:of the strong English brain and virtuous English blood within
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_27:0.0500:him wants to give the higher praise because he deeply knows
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_28:0.0500:and feels it and doesn't care about the music and merely
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_30:0.0500:character and capacity.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_33:0.0500:of the so called aesthetic school, a picture of heavenly beauty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0176_34:0.0500:appealing to eye, ear and imagination such a passage as would
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_1:0.0250:have intoxicated Keats, for example his own ode, " To the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_2:0.0250:Nightingale" which can hardly be surpassed surely in that way.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_3:0.0000:Let him notice carefully the effect on the class : they will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_4:0.0000:pleased a little possibly, perhaps apathetic, at best they wilP
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_5:0.0000:forget the impression in less than a week. Perhaps it may be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_6:0.0250:argued that the piece is too difficult, but easier pieces will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_7:0.0000:equally ineffective. Next read them a poem full of thought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_8:0.0000:strong, didactic and like a lash to the will ; let it be harsh in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_9:0.0250:sound, clumsy in imagery, and obscure in meaning, for example
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_10:0.0000:George Meredith's "England Before the Storm" Now note
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_11:0.0250:the effect ; nearly every pupil is deeply moved, the room is elec-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_12:0.0500:tric with intense feeling, every muscle of the undemonstrative
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_14:0.0000:power on earth ever roused that the very parents of these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_15:0.0000:boys have never suspected in them. Some may conclude that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_16:0.0000:they need more training in the emasculate, bloodless, brainless
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_17:0.0000:aestheticism of the Theodore Watts school; but, we conclude
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_18:0.0000:that boys who are so built that the dross of ugliness and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_19:0.0000:coarseness of fibre must be purged out and refined by poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_20:0.0000:with brains and morality in it would be wasting their time on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_21:0.0000:merely aesthetic verses, and it seems to us that in this larger
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_22:0.0000:possession they have all the sensuous love of beauty that go
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_23:0.0000:well with strength and power. We do not want French or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_24:0.0000:Japanese characters in this country, but English characters of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_25:0.0000:the best and firmest type. It would be a long stride indeed if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_26:0.0250:we could abolish at once and forever that wretched exotic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_27:0.0000:caprice that " didactic poetry is no poetry, and that aesthetic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_28:0.0000:poetry is the only poetry " and substitute for it the rule that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_29:0.0000:poetry in which truth and duty do not mingle in equal pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_30:0.0000:portions with pleasure and beauty is not the poetry that has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0177_31:0.0000:made England first in the literature of the whole world ancient
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0178_1:0.0500:accordance with his own taste ;.ud as the Latin has it " de
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0178_2:0.0250:gustibus rwn disputandum" Sitting before a few shelves of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0178_9:0.0500:charm called poetry ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_0:0.0500:THE DEFINITION OP POETRY. 161
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_2:0.0500:"fighting rag" alone repays us for all our trouble and we know
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_3:0.0500:that behind this Poet's forehead is a brain, kept alive by a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_5:0.0250:And so it is from Chaucer to Kipling, from Milton to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_6:0.0000:Havergal, from Shakespeare to Rossetti, we cannot spare one,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_7:0.0000:we must stretch the definition to include every verse that ever
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_8:0.0000:roused or pleased anyone : we muft conclude that poetry is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_9:0.0000:metrical expression of any thoughts or feelings that ever roused
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_10:0.0000:the soul of any reader whatever, even if the poet had but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_11:0.0000:himself for audience. No one has a right to limit this unless
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_12:0.0000:he adds to his definition " to me " and this is a case where it is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_13:0.0000:less dogmatic to use the first personal pronoun than to omit it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_14:0.0000:If we limit poetry (in order to keep a high standard) to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_15:0.0000:work of the greatest men, we may very well accept Shelley's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_16:0.0000:opinion that poetry is the best thoughts of the greatest men
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_17:0.0000:expressed in adequate language; but many would add "(to me)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_18:0.0000:adequate language for the best thoughts must be metrical or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0179_19:0.0250:highly musical."

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_1:0.0000:THE STUDY OP A POEM.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_3:0.0000:ously before us ; it strengthens the step and straightens the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_4:0.0000:way. To what end do we study poems in our schools? All
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_5:0.0000:lessons in English have for their object the mastery of our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_6:0.0000:mother tongue, and this mastery comprises two simple and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_7:0.0000:definite elements, the power of reading, and the power of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_8:0.0250:writing or composing English. Since grammar no longer deals
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_9:0.0000:with orthography, etymology and prosody, but only with syntax
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_10:0.0000:or sentence-building, it may be said to help us to write and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_11:0.0000:speak English ; any value the subject has beyond that of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_12:0.0000:enabling us to appreciate sound syntax, arises from the fact
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_13:0.0000:that grammar is not altogether an English study, but to some
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_14:0.0000:extent an increasingly large extent a branch of science. It
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_15:0.0000:is not impossible that technical grammar may eventually fall
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_16:0.0000:to the lot of the science-master ; if not, it will remain in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_17:0.0250:English division more on account of its subject matter, than on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_18:0.0500:account of its objects and methods.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_19:0.0250:In literature we read that we may learn to read, that is to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_20:0.0000:arrive at a full comprehension of masterpieces of our great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_21:0.0000:English authors. In rhetoric we read not that we may learn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_22:0.0000:to read, but that we may learn to write ; that is, we contem-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_23:0.0000:plate masterpieces that we may through reflection or unconscious
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_24:0.0000:imitation, catch some of the methods by which our great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_25:0.0000:authors produced their successful works, ,and apply these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_26:0.0000:methods to the feeble efforts at composition that our work or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_27:0.0000:ambition may require us to make. Composition is a practical
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_28:0.0000:application of the principles of good writing, as we have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_29:0.0250:learned them in grammar and rhetoric.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0183_30:0.0500:166
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_1:0.0000:WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_3:0.0000:little to do with writing ; rhetoric will naturally use prose
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_4:0.0000:examples for its phenomena, inasmuch as prose is what the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_5:0.0000:great majority would learn to" compose. Though the study of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_6:0.0000:poetry will tend to improve our thoughts and feelings, and to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_7:0.0000:elevate our diction, it is best that it should be studied without
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_8:0.0250:much direct reference to composition, because it has an impor-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_10:0.0250:the purpose of improving our composing powers.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_12:0.0250:for the purpose of learning to read the works of our great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_13:0.0000:authors with appreciation and refined discernment. In the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_14:0.0250:arguments that follow it will be taken for granted that improve
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_15:0.0000:rnent of the taste and understanding are the chief aim with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_16:0.0250:beginners, and not immediate pleasure. Even should the poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_17:0.0000:class prove duller than it should, the student would console
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_18:0.0000:himself with the fact that the drudgery of minute criticism
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_19:0.0250:brings its reward in after life, in the form of superior powers
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_20:0.0000:of grasping and appreciating new poems. Great care should
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_21:0.0500:be taken however, to see that no pupil should, in the discipline
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_22:0.0000:of minute reading, acquire a distaste for all poetry.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_24:0.0250:with such poems as children love without urging or much ex-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_25:0.0000:planation, and would proceed by imperceptible steps upward,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_26:0.0000:year by year, until the mind could enjoy such works as The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_27:0.0000:Grammarian's Funeral, In Memoriam, and Lear. How practic-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_28:0.0000:able such a course is, and how blind are we who neglect the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_29:0.0000:obvious blessings of it to study here and there from year to year
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_30:0.0000:without progress or systematic effort. Every boy of twelve with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_31:0.0000:an average imagination can read Scott's poems with delight ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_32:0.0000:but there are simpler i*hymes for younger or weaker children.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_33:0.0000:Suppose we begin with Nursery Rhymes and Andrew Lang's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_34:0.0250:Poetry Book for Children, proceed to Scott and Campbell, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0184_35:0.0000:parts of Byron, thence to Longfellow and Tennyson's simpler
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_1:0.0500:poems, and through these and others on the same level to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_2:0.0000:light comedies of Shakespeare, is it not manifest that the young
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_3:0.0000:student may make a continuous study of poetry that will keep
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_4:0.0000:pace with the age, and promote his spiritual growth to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_5:0.0000:great and endless benefit of his character and habits of thought 1 ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_6:0.0000:Not only is this course ideal : it is perfectly feasible, and even
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_7:0.0000:easy. An anthology of a few hundred pages for use in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_8:0.0000:public schools, and another, or two or three others, properly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_9:0.0000:graded for use in high schools, would accomplish the whole
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_10:0.0000:purpose. Who can fail to remember the ardent desire with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_11:0.0000:which every piece in the Reader was searched for new thoughts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_12:0.0000:and feelings in school days 1 Is not the wisest course to take
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_13:0.0000:advantage of this natural desire by putting in the Reader such
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_14:0.0000:a gradation of poems as will lead a pupil to the higher levels of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_15:0.0000:taste ? It would be a liberal education to many pupils to have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_16:0.0250:even Mackay's " Thousand and One Gems of English Poetry "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_17:0.0500:in their desks for use in " spare hours."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_19:0.0000:progress in the comprehension of the best poems, we meet an-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_20:0.0000:other question which requires a definite answer : Are we to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_21:0.0000:study each poem in order to make it our own that is, are we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_22:0.0000:to regard the mastery of that particular poem as our object, or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_23:0.0000:are we to study it in such a way that we may be able to read
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_24:0.0000:other poems more intelligently ? The importance of this ques-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_25:0.0000:tion will be seen immediately. Let us suppose that we read the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_26:0.0000:beautiful Ode to Immortality, in the present volume, simply
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_27:0.0000:that we may master it for our own complete possession : if we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_28:0.0000:do, it will be a noble piece of mental furniture for the remainder
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_29:0.0000:of life, and by its presence in the mind will do much to attract
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_30:0.0000:great thoughts, and to repel vulgar and commonplace views.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_31:0.0500:If the reading of it gave no reward but the possession of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_32:0.0000:piece itself, our time would still be well spent in studying it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0185_34:0.0500:poetry than the poems ; that is we may approach it as a step
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_0:0.0250:168 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_2:0.0000:do well to throw all inductive and socratic methods aside, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_3:0.0000:to get all the information we can about its meaning as rapidly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_4:0.0000:and easily as possible ; in the latter case we do well to do every
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_5:0.0000:thing we can for ourselves, as in a mental gymnasium where
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_6:0.0000:every feat we perform unaided makes us stronger to per
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_7:0.0000:form other and more difficult feats. The second method
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_8:0.0000:is slower, but while it gives more trouble, it gives greater
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_9:0.0000:rewards. When the former method is followed, care should
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_10:0.0000:be taken to accept no opinions without careful consider-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_11:0.0000:ation, and care should be taken that what is acquired so easily
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_12:0.0000:is not forgotten with equal ease. In the latter method the rule
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_13:0.0250:is, " Let no one tell you anything that you can learn by your
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_14:0.0000:own efforts." The danger here is that time may be wasted in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_15:0.0000:work that is really not a study of poetry at all for example,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_16:0.0000:in hunting up geographical and historical references which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_17:0.0000:ought to be given in a convenient form in the notes ; also there
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_18:0.0000:is the danger that your own efforts may never be sufficient to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_19:0.0000:put you in possession of the best qualities of the poem, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_20:0.0000:that you will forget that this rule does not forbid you to learn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_21:0.0000:all that you can learn by any means from any one whatever,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_22:0.0000:after you have done your best for yourself. Every good student
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_23:0.0000:of arithmetic desires to know whether he has reached "the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_24:0.0250:right answer," and in order to know that, he turns to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_25:0.0000:teacher or " the back of the book ; " just so every good student
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_26:0.0000:of a poem will desire to compare his own views with those of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_27:0.0000:his teacher or his editor ; but he should work out the problem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_28:0.0250:first, if he would improve his powers of reading with compre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_29:0.0500:hension.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_32:0.0250:replied astutely, '' An ordinary a in ateur^ doesn't know what to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0186_33:0.0500:look for in a picture." Could any words express better the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_2:0.0250:kicking precious gold ore aside with his tattered boots be-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_6:0.0000:the assistance of the author's name, is to be able to read poetry
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_7:0.0000:with true critical acumen. Of course critics differ, tastes differ,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_8:0.0000:but there are poems, as well as pictures and faces, of undisputed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_9:0.0250:beauty and worth, and the student is no longer an ordin-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_10:0.0000:ary amateur critic who can discern such works unaided. Per-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_11:0.0000:haps then the best way to read poetry is to read some poems
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_12:0.0500:chiefly for their own sakes these would be acknowledged
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_13:0.0000:masterpieces, concerning whose value and power all the world
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_14:0.0000:agree ; and then also to read some poems chiefly for exercise of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_15:0.0000:the critical powers, avoiding the opinions of others until we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_16:0.0000:have reached a not too dogmatic opinion of our own. In the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_17:0.0250:present voulme it would be well to master the Ode to Duty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_18:0.0000:and The Ode to Immortality in a reverent spirit of admira-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_21:0.0000:and wonder of the cultivated that it would not be amiss in a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_22:0.0000:young person to entertain an almost superstitious respect for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_23:0.0000:their genius, even before their merits are realized. Respect for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_24:0.0000:the authority of universal cultivated opinion is not a mark of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_25:0.0000:weakness in a student. With reference, however, to some of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_26:0.0000:poems in this collection that are not so famous, greater freedom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_27:0.0000:of judgment may be exercised, and their rank may be assigned
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_28:0.0000:with a due regard for their merits as discovered by diligent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_29:0.0250:search. " Censure me in your wisdom," said Brutus, " but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0187_30:0.0500:awake your senses that ye may the better judge."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_5:0.0250:No one can be said to understand a poem fully except its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_6:0.0500:author j we understand a poem in proportion as we approach
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_7:0.0250:the author's intentions, mood and thoughts in the creation of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_8:0.0000:it. The poet proceeded from the thoughts and feelings to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_9:0.0250:language, we must travel in the other direction. The more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_11:0.0500:nearly we see the meaning of his language.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_16:0.0000:are expressed to others. To the ordinary reader the language
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_17:0.0000:as such is of small importance ; even to the student the central
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_18:0.0000:thought or subject of the poem and the various thoughts and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_19:0.0000:feelings which impress him are by far the most important part
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_20:0.0000:though it is impossible for the educated reader to ignore the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_29:0.0500:sider the parts before considering the whole work very fully.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_30:0.0500:Still the first glance at a picture or group of statuary should
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_31:0.0250:reveal its general purpose, and so, even a play three hours long
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_35:0.0500:be analysed, or loosened up into stanzas or paragraphs (or acts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0188_36:0.0250:and scenes), and the central idea of each should be noted in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_1:0.0250:concise language. The synopsis thus made should be used to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_2:0.0000:prove that the whole piece has unity as well as variety :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_3:0.0000:unity means singleness of purpose in a work of art. Also
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_4:0.0000:the order in which the parts are introduced should be observed ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_5:0.0250:in narration the natural order is that of time : in argument we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_6:0.0500:proceed from enunciation to illustration, prooi^ and conclusion,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_7:0.0000:from cause to effect, from facts to inference and generalization ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_8:0.0000:in description we proceed from the outline to the details, pre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_9:0.0000:serving in the latter, a certain climatic order. When a poet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_10:0.0000:seems to violate the natural order of writing his reasons for so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_11:0.0000:doing should be investigated ; it is in the departure from the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_12:0.0250:regular and established way of writing that we perceive the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_15:0.0500:whose substance can be stated in a single^^]e^ir_sje^itence have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0189_23:0.0250:verses. Memorize
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_6:0.0250:It is well to understand the classification of poems for this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_7:0.0000:reason : an artist's success must be judged largely by hisjnten-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_8:0.0000:tions; if a poet designs a play for the stage, it is a failure if
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_9:0.0000:it does not please in the theatre ; but if he tells us that his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_10:0.0000:play is meant to be read but not acted, he is judged by a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_11:0.0000:different standard. It is not wise in a critic to say of a short
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_12:0.0250:story, " this is not a good novel," any more than it is to blame
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_13:0.0000:a schooner for not being a racing yacht. Hence, every student
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_14:0.0000:should know the kinds of poetry, and endeavour to learn the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_15:0.0000:rules of structure that apply to each kind, so that he may
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_16:0.0250:praise or censure with due regard to the author's intentions ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_17:0.0000:the wild and lawless frenzy of Gray's Bard is not inappropriate
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_18:0.0000:in an ode, but tho same license of language and passion would
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_19:0.0000:be shocking in an elegy. Matthew Arnold's defence of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_20:0.0000:illogical but natural and convenient Greek classification of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_21:0.0000:poems into epic, lyric and dramatic, will commend itself to all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_22:0.0500:who have compared it with more logical but less convenient
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_24:0.0000:Although it is not well to consider the fame of the author
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_25:0.0000:when we read poems in a scientific spirit, it is certainly wise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_26:0.0000:to learn all we can of his character, life^and motives,, before
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_27:0.0000:considering that we have come into full possession of his works.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_28:0.0000:This is the universally accepted view, and though it leads to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_29:0.0500:serious abuses it also has many arguments to support it.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_30:0.0500:The danger of reading the life of an author is that the stu-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_33:0.0500:the right either to agree with him or to differ from him. Certain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0190_34:0.0500:it is that weakrnmded readers are in danger of praising raptur-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_1:0.0000:ously poems they have never read, and speaking of poets as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_2:0.0000:their favourites whom they know only through the " books
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_3:0.0250:about books." And yet the spurious admiration is harmless
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_4:0.0000:it is the superstition of the worshipper who has faith because
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_5:0.0000:he cannot know, and being entirely with literature cannot be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_6:0.0000:against it also. These same readers, if they had not this faith,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_7:0.0000:would perhaps be Philistines of a deeper dye. Again is it not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_8:0.0000:on the whole more conducive to sweetness and light that a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_9:0.0000:large and wise authority such as the biographers possess should
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_10:0.0250:sway the ignorant than their own ugly and petty prejudices'?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_11:0.0000:It is the old question of authority against individual opinion.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_12:0.0000:Our own opinion is that, after a fair effort at understanding the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_13:0.0000:poet's work, the student should make a thorough study of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_14:0.0000:poet's life and times. Moreover, it seems likely that having
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_15:0.0000:experienced a reaction from the days when " Collier's Litera-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_16:0.0000:ture " took the place of the study of the masterpieces, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_17:0.0000:having on account of that reaction abandoned the study of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_18:0.0000:history of literature almost entirely, we have reached an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_19:0.0000:extreme scarcely less detrimental to the best interests of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_20:0.0000:study of literature than the former condition had proved :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_21:0.0000:" truth lies between " : a cultivated reader should have an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_22:0.0000:intelligent knowledge of the schools of authors and of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_23:0.0000:biographies of authors, as well as a thorough acquaintance with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_24:0.0000:their best productions. There is some use in lists of names
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_25:0.0250:of authors and books. Many a pupil is leaving our schools
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_26:0.0000:nowadays a positive ignoramus for lack of a few lessons ia
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_27:0.0000:the history of literature.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_31:0.0250:After this it is sometimes helpful to write a critique of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0191_32:0.0500:poem, as if for publication in a review, dealing with the most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_5:0.0250:poet to compare what he says on a subject with the words of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_6:0.0250:another writer on the same subject. Dozens of poems have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_7:0.0500:been written on the sky-lark ; and it is very often possible for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_12:0.0250:as suggestive. Neither is the order in which the divisions are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_13:0.0000:given meant to be followed nor is it intended that all these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_14:0.0000:divisions should be applied to the study of every poem. It is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_15:0.0000:hoped however, that it will, if kept before the student, prevent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_16:0.0000:him from leaving the poem before he has considered the most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_17:0.0250:important topics ; in reading a poem one may become so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_18:0.0000:absorbed in one phase of it as to leave it without noticing other
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_19:0.0250:important matters. When this scheme is applied to a drama,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_20:0.0000:it should be supplemented by other divisions, especially (a)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_21:0.0000:Characterization, and (6) The harmony or keepinj between the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0192_22:0.0000:character and his words.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_11:0.0000:are trifling in proportion to his contempt for imposing appear-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_12:0.0000:ances; the reflections are profound, according to the gravity
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_16:0.0500:Wordsworth lived in the open air, South ey in his library,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_17:0.0500:which Coleridge used to call his wife. Southey had particularly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_18:0.0250:elegant habits (Wordsworth called them finical) in the use of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_19:0.0000:books. Wordsworth, on the other hand, was so negligent and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0200_20:0.0000:so self-indulgent in the same case that, as Southey, laughing,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_18:0.0000:concentration, his majesty, his pathos have no parallel \ none
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_22:0.0500:Wordsworth's residence and mine are often miles asunder a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_23:0.0000:sufficient distance to preclude any frequent interchange of visits.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_24:0.0000:I have known him nearly twenty years, and for about half that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_25:0.0000:time intimately. The strength and the character of his mind you
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_26:0.0000:see in "The Excursion;" and his life does not belie his writings;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_27:0.0000:for in every relation of life and point of view he is a truly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_28:0.0000:exemplary and admirable man. In conversation he is powerful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_29:0.0000:beyond any of his contemporaries ; and as a poet I speak not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_30:0.0000:from the partiality of friendship, nor because we have been
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_31:0.0000:absurdly held up MS both writing upon one concerted system of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0201_32:0.0000:poetry, but. with the most deliberate exercise of impartial
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_6:0.0250:pretence in right or wrong of which we speak at all at the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_7:0.0000:feet of Mr. Wordsworth, recognizing him as we do a poet-hero
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_8:0.0000:of a movement essential to the better being of poetry, as poet-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_9:0.0250:prophet of utterances greater than those who first listened
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_10:0.0000:could comprehend, and of influences most vital and expensire,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_11:0.0000:we are yet honest to confess that certain things in the " Lyrical
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_12:0.0000:Ballads," which most provoke the ignorant, innocent hootings
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_13:0.0250:of the mob, do not seem to us all heroic. Love, like ambition,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_14:0.0000:may overvault itself, and Betty Foys of the Lake School (so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_15:0.0000:called) may be as subject to conventionalities as Pope's Lady
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_16:0.0000:Betties. And perhaps our great poet might, through the very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_17:0.0000:vehemence and nobleness of his hero and prophet work for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_18:0.0000:nature, confound, for some blind moment, and by an association
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0202_19:0.0000:easily traced and excused, nature with rusticity, the simple

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_13:0.0500:RUSKIN'S OPINION OF WORDSWORTH'S POWERS.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_15:0.0000:Wordsworth is simply a Westmoreland peasant, with con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_16:0.0000:siderably less shrewdness than most border Englishmen or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_17:0.0000:Scotsmen inherit ; and sense of humor : but gifted (in this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_18:0.0250:singularly) with vivid sense of natural beauty, and a pretty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_19:0.0000:turn for reflections, not always acute, but, as far as they reach,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_20:0.0000:medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_21:0.0000:him. Water to parched lips may be better than Samian wine,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_22:0.0000:but do not let us therefore confuse the qualities of wine and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_23:0.0000:water. I much doubt there being many inglorious Miltons in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_24:0.0000:our country churchyards ; but I am very sure there are many
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_25:0.0250:Words worths resting there, who were inferior to the renowned
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_26:0.0250:one only in caring less to hear themselves talk ....
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_27:0.0500:I am by no means sure that his influence on the stronger
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_28:0.0250:minds of his time was anywise hastened or extended by the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_29:0.0250:spirit of tunefulness under whose guidance he discovered that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_30:0.0000:Heaven rhymed to seven, and Foy to boy. Tuneful neverthe-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_31:0.0000:less at heart, and of the heavenly choir, I gladly and frankly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0204_32:0.0000:acknowledge him ; and our English literature enriched with a

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_5:0.0000:ful to sinless creatures and scatheless, such of the flock as do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_6:0.0000:not stray. Hopeful at least, ii" not faithful ; content with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_7:0.0000:intimations of immortality such as may be in skipping of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_8:0.0000:lambs, and laughter of children incurious to see in the hands
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_9:0.0000:the print of the nails. A gra,cious and constant mind ; as the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_10:0.0000:herbage of its native hills, fragrant and pure; yet, to. the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_11:0.0000:sweep and the shadow, the stress and distress, of the greater
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_12:0.0000:souls of men, as the tufted thyme to the laurel wilderness of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_13:0.0250:Tempe, as the gleaming euphrasy to the dark branches of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_18:0.0500:become household words as of Wordsworth. If Pope has made
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_19:0.0250:current more epigrams of worldly wisdom, to Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_20:0.0500:belongs the nobler praise of having denned for us, and given
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_21:0.0000:us for a daily possession, those faint and vague suggestions of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_22:0.0250:other-worldliness, of whose gentle ministry with our baser
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_23:0.0000:nature the hurry and bustle of life scarcely ever allowed us to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_24:0.0000:be conscious. He has won for himself a secure immortality by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_25:0.0500:a depth of intuition which makes only the best minds at their
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_26:0.0500:best hours worthy, or, indeed, capable, of his companionship,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_27:0.0500:and by a homely sincerity of human sympathy which reaches
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_28:0.0000:the humblest heart. Our language owes him gratitude for the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_29:0.0000:habitual purity and abstinence of his style, and we who speak
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_30:0.0000:it for having emboldened us to take delight in simple things,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0205_31:0.0250:and to trust ourselves to our own instincts. And he hath his

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_9:0.0500:Perhaps I cannot better sum up the whole matter than by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_10:0.0000:adopting, if I may, the words of a correspondent. He observes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_11:0.0000:(1) That while Wordsworth spiritualizes the outward world
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_12:0.0000:more than any other poet has done, his feeling for it is essen-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_13:0.0000:tially manly. Nature he always insists, gives gladness to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_14:0.0000:glad, comfort and support to the sorrowful. (2) There is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_15:0.0000:wondrous depth of his feeling for the domestic affections, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_16:0.0000:more especially for the constancy of them. (3) He must be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_17:0.0000:considered a leader in that greatest movement of modern
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_18:0.0000:times care for our humbler brethren; his part being not to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_19:0.0250:help them in their sufferings, but to make ns reverence them
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_20:0.0000:for what they are, and what they have in common with us or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_21:0.0000:in greater measure than ourselves. These are the tendencies
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_22:0.0000:breathed from every line he wrote. He took the commonest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_23:0.0000:sights of earth and the homeliest household affections, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_24:0.0250:made yon feel that these which men commonly take to be the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_27:0.0250:where leads to its outer court, lifting our thoughts into a region
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_28:0.0000:"neighbouring to heaven, and that no foreign hand." If he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_29:0.0000:was not universal in the sense in which Shakespeare was and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_30:0.0000:Goethe aimed to be, it was because he was smitten with too
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0206_32:0.0250:His eye was too intense, too prophetic to admit of his looking
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_0:0.0500:CRITICAL ESTIMATES. 189
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_1:0.0250:at life dramatically. In fact, no poet of modern times has had
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_2:0.0000:in him so much of the prophet. In the world of nature, to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_3:0.0000:a revealer of things hidden, the sanctifier of things common,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_4:0.0000:the interpreter of new and unsuspected relations, the opener of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_5:0.0000:another sense in men ; in the moral world, to be the teacher of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_6:0.0000:truths hitherto neglected or unobserved, the awakener of men's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_7:0.0000:hearts to the solemnities that encompass them, deepening our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_8:0.0250:reverence for the essential soul, apart from accident and circum-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_9:0.0000:stance, making us feel more truly, more tenderly, more pro-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_10:0.0000:foundly, lifting the thoughts upward through the shows of timo
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_11:0.0000:to which is permanent and eternal, and bringing down on the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_12:0.0000:transitory things of eye and ear some shadow of time to that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_29:0.0250:*This poem is always taken as referring to Wordsworth. Wordsworth in youth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_30:0.0250:was a revolutionist, in age a strong conservative. Browning, writing of this poem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0207_31:0.0000:admits that he thought of Wordsworth's change of views, but says the work was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_29:0.0000:unable to hold the noble metal which they ought to contain.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_30:0.0250:But the metal is really noble, and besides several very beautiful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_31:0.0000:sonnets, there is now and then a work among others his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_32:0.0000:largest, " The Excursion " in which we forget the poverty of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_33:0.0250:the getting up to admire the purity and elevation of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0208_34:0.0250:thought. In truth, the author hardly puts himself to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_0:0.0500:CRITICAL ESTIMATES. 191
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_1:0.0250:trouble of imagining ; he walks along, and converses with a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_2:0.0000:pious Scotch peddler -this is the whole of the story. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_3:0.0000:poets of this school always walk, look at nature, and think of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_4:0.0000:human destiny it is their permanent attitude. He converses,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_5:0.0000:then, with the peddler a meditative character who has been
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_6:0.0000:educated by a long experience of men and things, who speaks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_7:0.0000:very well (too well !) of the soul and of God, and relates to him
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_8:0.0000:the history of a good woman who died of grief in her cottage ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_9:0.0250:then he meets a solitary, a sort of sceptical Hamlet morose,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_10:0.0000:made gloomy by the death of his family and the disappoint-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_11:0.0000:ments suffered during his long journeyings ; then a clergyman,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_12:0.0000:who took them to a village church-yard and described to them
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_13:0.0000:the life of several interesting people who are buried there.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_14:0.0000:Observe that just in proportion as reflections and moral dis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_15:0.0000:cussions arise, and as scenery and moral descriptions spread
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_16:0.0000:before us in hundreds, so also dissertations entwine their long
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_17:0.0000:thorny hedge-rows, and metaphysical thistles multiply in every
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_18:0.0000:corner. In short, the poem is as grave and dull as a sermon.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_19:0.0000:And yet in spite of this ecclesiastical air, and the tirades against
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_20:0.0000:Voltaire and his age, we feel ourselves impressed as by a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_21:0.0250:discourse of Theodore Jouffroy. After all. Wordsworth is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_22:0.0000:convinced. He has spent his life meditating on these kinds of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_23:0.0000:ideas they are the poetry of his religion, race, climate ; he is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_24:0.0000:imbued with them ; his pictures, stories, interpretations of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_25:0.0000:visible nature and human life tend only to put the mind in a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_26:0.0000:grave disposition which is proper to the inner man. I enter
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_27:0.0000:here as in the valley of Port Royal : a solitary nook, stagnant
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_28:0.0000:waters, gloomy woods, ruins, grave-stones, and above all the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_29:0.0000:idea of responsible man and the obscure beyond, to which we
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_30:0.0000:involuntarily move. I forget the careless French fashions, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_31:0.0000:customs of not disturbing the even tenor of life. There is an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_32:0.0000:imposing seriousness, an austere beauty in this sincere reflection ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_33:0.0250:we begin to feel respect, we stop, and are moved. This book is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0209_34:0.0250:likf> a Protestant temple august, though bare and monotonous.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_2:0.0500:grave harmony, as a motet accompanies meditation or prayer.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_9:0.0000:Burke induced me to ask Carlyle who was the best talker he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_10:0.0000:had met among notable people in London. He said that when
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_11:0.0000:he met Wordsworth first he had been assured that he talked
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_12:0.0000:better than any man in England. It was his habit to talk
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_13:0.0000:whatever was in his mind at the time, with total indifference
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_14:0.0000:to the impression it produced on his hearers ; on this occasion
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_15:0.0000:he kept discoursing on how far you could get carried out of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_16:0.0250:London on this side and on that for sixpence. One was disap-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_17:0.0000:pointed perhaps, but, after all, this was the only healthy way of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_18:0.0000:talking to say what is actually in your mind, and let sane crea-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_19:0.0000:tures who listen make what they can of it. Whether they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_20:0.0000:understood it or not, Wordsworth maintained a stern composure,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_21:0.0000:and went his way, content- that the world went quite another
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_22:0.0250:road. When he knew him better, he found that no man gave
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_23:0.0250:you so faithful and vivid a picture of any person or thing which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_28:0.0000:out of what Wordsworth had to say to you than from anybody
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_29:0.0500:else, Leigh Hunt would emit more pretty, pleasant ingenious
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_30:0.0250:flashes in an hour than Wordsworth in a day. But in the end
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0210_31:0.0500:you would find, if woll considered, that you had been drinking
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_0:0.0500:CRITICAL ESTIMATES. 193
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_1:0.0500:perfumed water in one case, and in the other you got the sense
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_2:0.0000:of a deep, earnest man, who had thought silently and painfully
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_4:0.0000:with the man. When he spoke of poetry he harangued about
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_5:0.0000:meters, cadences, rhythms, and so forth, and one could not be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_6:0.0000:at the pains of listening to him. But on all other subjects he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_7:0.0500:had more sense in him of a sound and instructive sort than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_12:0.0250:had wrought a revolution in English poetry. He taught it to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_13:0.0500:speak in unsophisticated language, and of the humbler and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_14:0.0000:more familiar interests of life.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_15:0.0250:Carlyle said no, not so ; all he had got to say in that way
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_16:0.0000:was like a few driblets from the great ocean of German specula-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_17:0.0000:tion on kindred subjects by Goethe and others. Coleridge, who
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_18:0.0000:had been in Germany, brought it over with him, and they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_19:0.0250:translated Teutonic thought into a poor, disjointed, whitey-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_20:0.0000:brown, sort of English, and that was nearly all. But Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_21:0.0000:worth, after all, was a man of most practical mind of any of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_22:0.0000:the persons connected with literature whom he had encountered
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_23:0.0250:though his pastoral pipings were far from being of the impor-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_24:0.0000:tance his admirers imagined. He was essentially a cold, hard,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_25:0.0000:silent, practical man, who, if he had not fallen into poetry,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_26:0.0000:would have done effectual work of some sort in the world.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_27:0.0250:This was the impression one got of him as he looked out of his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0211_28:0.0250:stern blue eyes, superior to men and circumstances.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_4:0.0000:His legs were pointedly condemned by all the female connois-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_5:0.0000:seurs in legs that ever I heard lecture upon that topic ; not that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_6:0.0250:they were bad in any way which would force itself upon your
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_7:0.0000:notice there was no absolute deformity about them, and un-

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_9:0.0000:standard of human requisition ; for I calculate, upon good data,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_10:0.0000:that with these identical legs Wordsworth must have traversed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_11:0.0000:a distance of one hundred and seventy-five to one hundred and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_12:0.0000:eighty thousand English miles a mode of exertion which to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_13:0.0000:him, stood in the stead of wine, spirits, and all other stimulants
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_14:0.0000:whatsoever to the animal spirits; to which he has been in-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_15:0.0000:debted for a life of unclouded happiness, and we for much of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_16:0.0000:what is most excellent in his writings. But useful as they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_17:0.0000:have proved themselves the Wordsworthian legs were certainly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_18:0.0000:not ornamental ; and it was really a pity, as I agreed with a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_19:0.0250:lady in thinking, that he had not another pair for evening-dress
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_20:0.0250:parties, when no boots lend their friendly aid to mask our
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_21:0.0000:imperfections from the eyes of female rigorists the elegantes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_22:0.0000:formarum spectatrices. A sculptor would certainly have dis-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_23:0.0500:approved of their contour. But the worst part of Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_24:0.0000:worth's person was the bust ; there was a narrowness and a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_25:0.0250:droop about the shoulders which became striking, and had an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_26:0.0000:effect of meanness when brought into close juxtaposition with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_27:0.0000:a figure of a most statuesque order .... But the total effect of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_28:0.0000:Wordsworth's person was always worst in a state of motion ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_29:0.0000:for according to the remark I have heard from many country
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_30:0.0000:people, " he walked like a cade " a cade being some sort of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_31:0.0000:insect which advances by an oblique motion. Meantime his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_32:0.0000:face that was one which would have made amends for greater
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_33:0.0250:defects of figure ; it was certainly the noblest for intellectual
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0212_34:0.0500:effects that, in actual life, I have seen, or at least have con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_0:0.0500:CRITICAL ESTIMATES. 195
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_1:0.0500:sciously been led to notice. Many such, or even finer, I have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_2:0.0250:seen among the portraits of Titian, and, in a later period, among
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_3:0.0250:those of Vandvck, from the great era of Charles I., as also
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_4:0.0250:from the court of Elizabeth and of Charles II. ; but none which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_5:0.0000:has so much impressed me in my own time. It was a face of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_6:0.0000:the long order, often falsely classed as oval. The forehead was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_7:0.0000:not remarkably lofty, but it is perhaps remarkable for its.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_8:0.0000:breadth and expansive development. Neither are the eyes of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_9:0.0000:Wordsworth " large," as is erroneously stated somewhere in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_10:0.0000:" Peter's Letters ; " on the contrary they are (I think) rather
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_11:0.0250:small ; but that does not interfere with their effect, which at
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_12:0.0000:times is fine and suitable to his intellectual character .... I have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_13:0.0000:seen Wordsworth's eyes oftentimes affected powerfully in this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_14:0.0250:respect ; his eyes are not, under any circumstances, bright,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_15:0.0000:lustrous, or piercing ; but, after a long day's toil in walking, I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_16:0.0000:have seen them assume an appearance the most solemn and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_17:0.0250:spiritual that it is possible for the human eye to wear. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_18:0.0000:light which resides in them is at no time a superficial light, but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_19:0.0000:under favorable accidents it is a light which seems to come from
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_20:0.0250:depths below all depths ; in fact, it is more truly entitled to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_21:0.0250:held " The light that never was on land or sea" a light radia-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_22:0.0250:ting from some far spiritual world than any the most idealizing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_23:0.0000:light that ever yet a painter's hand created. The nose, a little
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_24:0.0000:arched and large, which, by the way (according to a natural phre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_25:0.0250:nology existing centuries ago among some of the lowest among
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_26:0.0000:the human species), has always been accounted an unequivocal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_27:0.0500:expression of animal appetites organically strong. And that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_28:0.0000:was in fact the basis of Wordsworth's intellectual power ; his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_29:0.0000:intellectual passions were fervent and strong, because they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_30:0.0000:rested upon a basis of animal sensibility superior to that of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_31:0.0000:most men, diffused through all the animal passions (or appe-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_32:0.0250:tites) ; and something of that will be found to hold of all poets
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0213_33:0.0000:who have been great by original force and power, not (as Vir-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_8:0.0000:1 appear to myself to find in these poems is the inconstancy of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_9:0.0000:the style. Under this name I refer to the sudden and unpre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_10:0.0000:pared transitions from lines or sentences of peculiar felicity (at
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_11:0.0000:all events striking and original) to a style, not only unimpas
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_12:0.0000:sioned but undistinguished. He sinks too often and too
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_13:0.0250:abruptly to that style which I should place in the second divi-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_14:0.0000:sion of language, dividing it into the three species : first, that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_15:0.0000:which is peculiar to poetry ; second, that which is only proper
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_16:0.0000:in prose; asd third, the neutral or common to both. There
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_17:0.0250:have been works, such as Cowley's Essay on Cromwell, in which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_18:0.0000:prose and verse are intermixed (not as in* the Consolation of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_19:0.0000:Boetius, or the Argenis of Barclay, by the, insertion of poems
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_20:0.0000:supposed to have been spoken or composed on occasions pre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_21:0.0000:viously related in prose, but) the poet passing from one to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_22:0.0000:other as the nature of the thoughts or his own feelings dictated.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_23:0.0000:Yet this mode of composition does not satisfy a cultivated taste.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_24:0.0000:There is something unpleasant in the being thus obliged to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_25:0.0000:alternate states of feeling so dissimilar, and this too in a species
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_26:0.0250:of writing, the pleasure from which is in part derived from the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_27:0.0000:preparation and previous expectation of the reader. A portion
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_28:0.0000:of that awkwardness is felt which hangs upon the introduction
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_29:0.0250:of songs in our modern comic operas; and to prevent which the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_30:0.0250:judicious Metastasio (as to whose exquisite taste there can be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_31:0.0250:no hesitation, whatever doubts may be entertained as to his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0214_32:0.0250:poetic genius) uniformly placed the aria at the end of the

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_1:0.0000:scene, at the same t imo that he almost always raises and impas-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_2:0.0000:sions the style of the recitative immediately preceding. ....
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_3:0.0000:The second defect I could generalize with tolerable accuracy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_4:0.0000:if the reader will pardon an uncouth and new-coined word.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_5:0.0000:There is, I should say, not seldom a matter-of-factness in certain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_6:0.0000:poems. This may be divided into, first, a laborious minuteness
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_7:0.0000:and fidelity in the representation of objects, and their positions,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_8:0.0000:as they appeared to the poet himself; secondly, the insertion of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_9:0.0000:accidental circumstances, in order to the full explanation of his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_10:0.0250:living characters, their dispositions and actions : which circum-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_11:0.0000:stances might be necessary to establish the probability of a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_12:0.0000:statement in real life, where nothing is taken foi granted by the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_13:0.0250:hearer, but appear superfluous in poetry, where the reader is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_16:0.0250:tain poems, from which one or other of two evils result. Either
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_17:0.0000:the thoughts and diction are different from that of the poet,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_18:0.0000:and then there arises an incongruity of style ; or they are the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_19:0.0000:same and indistinguishable, and then it presents a species of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_20:0.0250:ventriloquism where two are represented as talking, while in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_21:0.0250:truth one man only speaks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_22:0.0000:The fourth class of defects is closely connected with the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_23:0.0000:former; but yet are such as arise likewise from an intensity of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_24:0.0000:feeling disproportionate to such knowledge and value of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_25:0.0000:objects described, as can be fairly anticipated of men in general,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_26:0.0000:even of the most cultivated classes ; and with which therefore
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_27:0.0000:few only, and those few particularly circumstanced, can be sup-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_28:0.0000:posed to sympathize : in this class I comprise occasional prolix-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_29:0.0000:ity, repetition, and an eddying instead of progression of thought.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0215_30:0.0250:As instances, see page 27, 28, of the Poems, vol. i.,* and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0216_1:0.0250:This is an approximation to what might be called mental bom-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0216_2:0.0250:bast, as distinguished from verbal ; for as in the latter there is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0216_3:0.0000:a disproportion of the expressions to the thoughts, so in this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0216_4:0.0250:there is a disproportion of thought to the circumstance and

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_7:0.0000:" To return to ' We are Seven,' the piece that called forth this note, I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_8:0.0000:composed it while walking in the grove at Alfoxden. My friends
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_9:0.0000:will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_10:0.0000:fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_11:0.0000:When it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_12:0.0000:and my sister, and said, ' A prefatory stanza must be added, and j
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_13:0.0000:should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_14:0.0250:were finished.' I mentioned in substance what 1 wished to be expressed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0263_15:0.0500:and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza thus :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_0:0.0500:246 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_1:0.0000:Scotch and in the northern English dialects for ages. Bishop Percy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_2:0.0000:Burns and Scott, gave the ballad a wonderful vogue in the reign of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_3:0.0000:George III. , and many more recent writers have given us excellent work
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_4:0.0000:fashioned more or less directly upon the old border songs. The answer
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_5:0.0000:to the question why Coleridge and other modern writers use the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_6:0.0000:archaisms of the northern ballad-writers in their own ballads, is that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_7:0.0000:the ballad had flour'shed so famously in the northern tongue that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_8:0.0250:modern writers judged it wise to preserve the forms in which it had
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_9:0.0250:seen great days.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_14:0.0000:The ballad was usually a song of love or war. Its versification is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_15:0.0000:often, indeed usually, that of Lucy Gray a quatrain of two tetrameters
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_16:0.0000:and two trimeters arranged alternately, Usually only the second and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_17:0.0000:fourth lines rhyme. The weakness ef the versification of Lucy Gray
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_18:0.0000:arises largely from the fact that in more than a dozen instances the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_19:0.0500:accent falls upon a weak word, such as a, the, to, there, in, from, by; one
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_20:0.0500:line reads
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_23:0.0000:of, the effect is absurd. In the last stanza those who feel the beauty of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_24:0.0000:the poem will be careful to read it so as to avoid making it sound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_25:0.0000:ridiculous : (indeed this is true of nearly every stanza : ) to in the first
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_26:0.0500:line of it, is in the second, and you in the third will not bear the stress

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_30:0.0000:ridge's Ancient Mariner is the greatest ballad in English. Heine's Bal-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_31:0.0000:lads are perhaps the sweetest and tenderest in the world : there is a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_32:0.0500:beautiful translation in the Canterbury Series, but the German is very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0264_33:0.0500:easy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_10:0.0500:Bards and Scotch Reviewers, Byron indulges in a coarse and rather
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_11:0.0250:witty sketch of the poet, with a pointed allusion to the Idiot Boy, ending
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_17:0.0000:Wordsworth despised rank, (at least in his earlier days) and his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_18:0.0000:defence is well expressed by Coleridge when he says, " I honour a wise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_19:0.0000:and virtuous man without reference to the presence or absence of artifi-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_20:0.0000:cial advantages.' In Michael and in poems of similar motive, Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_21:0.0000:worth owes much to Burns, whom he greatly loved and heartily admired :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_22:0.0000:he had the power, preeminent in Burns of touching the hearts of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_23:0.0000:refined classes with a powerful sense of their common humanity, he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_24:0.0000:" astounded bosoms habitually enveloped in the thrice-piled folds of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_25:0.0000:social reserve, by compelling them to tremble nay, to tremble visibly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_26:0.0000:beneath the fearless touch of natural pathos." " Is there not the fifth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_27:0.0000:act of a tragedy in every death-bed, though it were a peasant's, and a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_28:0.0000:bed of heath ? " exclaims Carlyle. Wordsworth had the eye of sym-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_29:0.0000:pathy which makes the Story of Michael as great and significant as the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_30:0.0000:story of Macbeth, and while we may trust that Shakespeare had the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_31:0.0000:larger sounder judgment in attaching more importance to the prominent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_32:0.0250:and powerful, yet we must revere the grand democratic spirit of Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0265_33:0.0000:worth, Burns, Coleridge, and Carlyle.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0266_5:0.0500:for his positive merits, should remember his negative merits : the mean-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0266_31:0.0000:question of Wordsworth's claims : Wordsworth himself was a man of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0266_32:0.0250:great intellectual power, and as regards academic culture and literary
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0266_33:0.0000:associations "in the foremost files ; " yet he renounced the unquestioned
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0266_34:0.0250:fame of works like the Ode to Ditty and Laodatnia, to glory in works
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_2:0.0000:well are objects that can easily be missed ; the tradition by this time
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_3:0.0000:may be extinct in the neighbourhood : the man who related it to us was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_4:0.0000:very old." Scott's " Lady of the Lake " appeared ten years later, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_5:0.0000:the first canto of it gives a description of the chase quite different from
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_6:0.0250:Wordsworth's. But Cowper in Tlie Task, (Book III.) had spoken
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_11:0.0000:of sensibility, notably Bishop Butler, had spoken of the kindness men
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_12:0.0000:owe the lower animals. Butler and Agassiz both speak of a possible im-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_13:0.0000:mortality for animals. While many poets wara us not to be unkind to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0268_14:0.0000:helpless creatures, Coleridge takes a more positive strain in the story of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_10:0.0500:imagination ; is Wordsworth false to nature in this ? Compare the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_11:0.0250:characters of Adam and Corin, (Shakespeare's As You Like It, Act II,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_21:0.0000:might be more popular. There is something natural and pleasing about
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_22:0.0250:the order in which the details of the first stanza are told. The descrip-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_23:0.0000:tion in stanzas three and four is so picturesque, simple and withal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_24:0.0000:artistic, that one wishes the poet had given himself over to sensuous
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_25:0.0000:verse, and left moralizing to others. However, the lofty sentiment of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_26:0.0000:the last stanza of the poem seems to justify Wordsworth's method. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_27:0.0000:general regard for the dog as a faithful companion of man, calls for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_28:0.0000:poetical expression, and most people who are not "too clever by half,"
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_29:0.0500:will like this simple poem on account of the sincere admiration it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_30:0.0250:expresses for the hero.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_31:0.0250:Coleridge says of Fidelity : " The poem is for the greater part written
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_32:0.0500:in language as unraised and naked as any perhaps in the two volumes."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_33:0.0250:He calls attention to the superior style of stanza four, and of the last
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_34:0.0000:half of the last stanza. Comparing these parts with the rest of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_35:0.0000:work, he exclaims : " Can any candid and intelligent mind hesitate in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0269_36:0.0000:determining whie*i of these best represents the tendency and native
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_0:0.0500:252 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_8:0.0000:Of this poem Mr. R. H. Hutton says it treats of Wordsworth's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_9:0.0000:favourite theme ' the strength which the human heart has, or ought to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_10:0.0000:have, to contain itself in adverse circumstances." Again he says, " The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_11:0.0000:Leech-Gatherer has much less of buoyancy than the earlier poems, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_12:0.0000:sometimes here and there the stateliness of the later style." Coleridge
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_13:0.0000:finds in this work all the characteristic defects and merits of its author.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_14:0.0000:Wordsworth in a characteristic note says : " I describe myself as having
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_15:0.0000:been exalted to the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_16:0.0000:beauty of Nature ; and then as depressed, even in the midst of those
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_17:0.0000:beautiful objects, to the lowest dejection and despair. A young poet in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_18:0.0000:the midst of the happiness of Nature is described as overwhelmed by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_19:0.0000:the thoughts of the miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_20:0.0000:of all men, namely, poets. I think of this till I am so deeply impressed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_21:0.0000:with it that I consider the manner in which I am rescued from my dejec-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_22:0.0000:tion and despair almost as an interposition of Providence. A person
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_23:0.0000:reading the poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_24:0.0000:trolled, expecting something spiritual or supernatural. What is brought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_25:0.0000:forward? A lonely place, ' a pond, by which an .old man was, far from
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_26:0.0000:all house or home : ' not stood, nor sat, but was the figure presented in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_27:0.0000:the most naked simplicity possible. The feeling of spirituality or
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_28:0.0000:supernaturalness is again referred to as being strong in my mind in this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_29:0.0000:passage. How came he here? thought I, or what can he be doing? I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_30:0.0000:then describe him, whether ill or well is not for me to judge with perfect
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_31:0.0000:confidence ; but this I can confidently affirm, that though 1 believe God
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_32:0.0000:has given me a strong imagination, I cannot conceive a figure more im-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_33:0.0000:pressive than that of an old man like this, the survivor of a wife and ten
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_34:0.0000:children, travelling alone among the mountains and all lonely places,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_35:0.0000:carrying with him his own fortitude, and the necessities which an unjust
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_36:0.0250:state of society has laid upon him. You speak of his speech as tedious.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0270_37:0.0250:Everything is tedious when one does not read with the feelings of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0271_33:0.0500:following verses, which Wordsworth prefixed as a keynote to this song
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0271_34:0.0500:to the Daisy :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0272_0:0.0500:254 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0272_17:0.0250:worth's relation to nature he was less the poet who describes than the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0272_18:0.0500:interpreter : the daisy is not merely a sweet little flower, but it is a local
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0272_19:0.0500:habitation and a name, a symbol for those airy nothings that lived in his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0272_20:0.0250:own spirit.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0274_25:0.0500:and scientific a relation to the girl to strike our sympathies deeply,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0274_31:0.0250:notion of riding ; one meaning is a place where boats may ride at anchor.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0275_27:0.0250:poem was written, and when Keats was eleven The Solitary Reaper was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0275_28:0.0250:published. The similarity in tone, spirit and details between Keats'
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0275_29:0.0000:Ode to a Nightingale and this work is so obvious as to render their dates
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_0:0.0500:258 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_2:0.0250:This touching tribute to the memory of Burns is written in metre
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_3:0.0250:most strikingly reminding us of that poet : it is the metre of The Moun-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_4:0.0000:tain Daisy itself, as well as of many of his other songs. There is some-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_5:0.0000:thing paradoxical in Wordsworth's love of Burns, when we consider the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_6:0.0000:vulgar estimate of the character of the latter which prevailed in the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_7:0.0000:early part of this century. It is much to the credit of Wordsworth's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_8:0.0000:insight that he was one of the first to recognize the greatness of soul of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_9:0.0000:the plowman-poet. The noble essay on Burns by Carlyle, (written be-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_10:0.0000:fore the prose of the great moralist had become irregular and eccen-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_11:0.0000:tric) is at once a charming piece of English and wonderful piece of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_12:0.0250:critical sympathy : the following passage gives some idea of the view
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_13:0.0000:held in common by Carlyle and our author :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_14:0.0000:" We had something to say on the public moral character of Burns ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_15:0.0000:but this also we must forbear. We are far from regarding him as guilty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_16:0.0000:before the world, as guiltier than the average ; nay from doubting that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_17:0.0000:he is less guilty than one of ten thousand. Tried at a tribunal far more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_18:0.0000:rigid than that where the Plebiscita of common civic reputations are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_19:0.0000:pronounced, he has seemed to us even there less worthy of blame than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_20:0.0000:of pity and wonder. But the world is habitually unjust in its judg-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_21:0.0000:ments of such men ; unjust on many grounds, of which this one may be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_22:0.0000:stated as the substance : it decides, like a court of law, by dead statutes ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_23:0.0000:and not positively but negatively, less on what is done right, than on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_24:0.0000:what is or is not done wrong. Not the few inches of deflection from
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_25:0.0000:the mathematical orbit, which are so easily measured: but the ratio of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_26:0.0000:these to the whole diameter, constitutes the real aberration. This orbit
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_27:0.0000:may be a planet's, its diameter the breadth of the solar system ; or it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_28:0.0000:may be a city hippodrome ; nay the circle of a ginhorse, its diameter
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_29:0.0000:a score of feet or paces. But the inches of deflection only are measured :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_30:0.0000:and it is assumed that the diameter of the ginhorse, and that of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_31:0.0000:planet, will yield the same ratio when compared with them ! Here lies
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_32:0.0250:the root of many a blind, cruel condemnation of Burnses, Swifts, Rous-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_33:0.0000:seaus, which one never listens to with approval. Granted, the ship
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_34:0.0000:comes into harbor with shrouds and tackle damaged ; the pilot is blame-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_35:0.0000:worthy ; he has not been all-wise and all-powerful : but to know how
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_36:0.0500:blameworthy, tell us first whether his voyage has been round the Globe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_37:0.0000:or only to Kamsgate and the Isle of Dogs.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_38:0.0500:" With our readers in general, with men of right feeling anywhere,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0276_39:0.0250:we are not required to plead for Burns. In pitying admiration he lies
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_1:0.0250:marble ; neither will his Works, even as they are, pass away from the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_2:0.0000:memory of men. While the Shakespeares and Miltons roll on like
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_3:0.0000:mighty rivers through the country of Thought, bearing fleets of traffick-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_4:0.0000:ers and assiduous pearl-fishers on their waves ; this little Valclusa Foun-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_5:0.0250:tain will also arrest our eye : for this also is of Nature's own and most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_6:0.0000:cunning workmanship, bursts from the depths of the earth, with a full
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_7:0.0000:gushing current, into the light of day ; and often will the traveller turn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0277_8:0.0500:aside to drink of its clear waters, and muse among its rocks and pines ! "

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_8:0.0500:and the broad clear atmosphere of the last stanzas is reminiscent of Burns
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_17:0.0000:recollections of early childhood which to him were intimations of another
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_18:0.0000:world, is set forth fully and grandly in his great Ode ; this little poem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_19:0.0250:bears some such relation to the Ode on Intimations of Immortality, as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_20:0.0000:Break, Break, Break, bears to the In Memoriam. The main outlines of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_21:0.0250:the Ode are here in miniature, and the elevation of the last stanza shows
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_22:0.0250:that mingling of the child-philosopher and the student-philosopher which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_23:0.0250:makes the ending of the Ode so obscurely impressive. In Arnold's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0278_24:0.0250:Selections the following stanzas are added under the heading, The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_17:0.0250:The famous ballad by Hamilton entitled The Braes of Yarroiv, may
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_18:0.0000:be found in Percy's Reliqms, Second Series, Book III, Number 24. It
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_19:0.0000:was itself an imitation of "an old Scottish ballad on a similar subject,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_20:0.0000:with the same burden to each stanza." The three poems on Yarrow by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_21:0.0000:Wordsworth, were written respectively in the years 1803, 1814, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_22:0.0000:1831 : they are the direct offspring of Hamilton's ballad, as will be seen
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_23:0.0000:by the allusions to it in the first of them. In the Mother country they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_24:0.0000:are regarded with great favour, and indeed there is a repose, a strong
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_25:0.0000:unquestionable sense of beauty, a sober right-minded joy in Yarrow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0279_26:0.0000:Visited, that makes one think of pictures of English landscapes.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0284_33:0.0500:Button says: "Mr. Arnold places all the really first-rate work of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0284_34:0.0000:Wordsworth in the decade between 1798 and 1S08. I think he is right
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0284_35:0.0000:here. But I should put Wordsworth's highest perfection of style much
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0284_36:0.0250:nearer the later date than the earlier." In a contrast of the earliest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0284_37:0.0250:with the latest Yarrow, Hutton shows us with much skill the changes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_1:0.0500:that had come over Wordsworth's style in twenty-eight years. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_3:0.0250:sweet, rich, free and mellow, and gives no such impression of powerful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_4:0.0500:repression as the first. The criticism may be extended to apply to a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_5:0.0500:great deal of the poet's earlier and later work.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_6:0.0250:In the Yarrow Unvisited, the poet and his sister decide not to visit
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_7:0.0000:the famous stream for fear their lovely picture of it got from what they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_8:0.0000:had read and imagined should be injured by the scene itself. The poet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_9:0.0000:first visited Yarrow in the company of the Ettrick shepherd, Hogg,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_10:0.0000:author of that sweetest of ballads, Kifmeny : the second poem records
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_11:0.0000:the impressions of this occasion. The third poem is "a memorial of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_12:0.0000:the very last visit Scott (in company with Wordsworth) ever paid, not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_13:0.0250:to Yarrow only, but to any scene in that land which he had so loved and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_14:0.0250:glorified."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_17:0.0250:which suggests that Wordsworth's life gave vital unity to all his work.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_24:0.0500:worth corrects him, and adds that the swan with no companion but its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_25:0.0500:own reflection is a symbol of the utter loneliness of the scene : but Scott
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_26:0.0500:was misled by taking float for an assertive word in the plural, whereas
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_27:0.0500:it depends on let.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0285_32:0.0500:interest in the legends of the place ; that they were not so familiar to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_8:0.0500:make one think of "the light that never was ;" and the last three lines
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_12:0.0000:happy elevation of the bird with his own lowly lot, and aspires to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_13:0.0000:heavenly joys and triumphs ; but reflection comes to his aid, and instead
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_14:0.0000:of feeling disappointed when his dream is seen to be an illusion, he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_15:0.0250:determines to take the fact of the bird's joy, not as a call to present
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_16:0.0250:happiness, but as a promise of future raptures.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_25:0.0250:Wordsworth's lines reveal a great joy in contemplating the bird of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_26:0.0000:morning ; his sober imagination thinks out the bird's, thoughts, feels its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_27:0.0000:emotions with tender insight and poetic freshness, endows the gentle
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_28:0.0000:creature with a soul and makes ft the emblem of lofty spiritual aspira-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_29:0.0000:tion : the romantic nightingale suffers by comparison with this bird of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_30:0.0000:light and truth : the moralist cannot conclude this perfect lyric without
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_31:0.0000:a homely reference to the instincts of wisdom. The moral is worthy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_32:0.0000:and apposite, but a trifle prosy, in as much as readers who enjoy the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_33:0.0000:first sixteen lines would scarcely need the last two. Yet this is Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_34:0.0000:worth's method faithfirfly adhered to ; no bit of nature is so valuable as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_35:0.0250:an obj cfc of plea.su re to the senses and the imagination that it has not a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0286_36:0.0500:higher value as a spiritual symbol, or even a moral symbol.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_1:0.0000:Shelley's Skylark is less the voice of a man than the glorious outburst
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_2:0.0000:of the bird itself translated into English verse, and scarcely either
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_3:0.0000:gaining or losing by the change : it is harmonious madness and upon it
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_4:0.0000:logic, to say nothing of morality, has about as much claim as upon the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_5:0.0000:lark's own song : we care no more for the intellectual qualities of it than
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_6:0.0000:for the meaning of an Italian song : wherever sound and sense clash,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_7:0.0000:sense stands gracefully aside, and beautiful sound prevails. A well
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_8:0.0250:known critic, the Professor of Logic in the University of Aberdeen, finds
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_9:0.0000:the poem wild and lacking in precision of thought ; This would seem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_10:0.0000:to be its great charm, would it not, when one considers the harmony of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_11:0.0000:style and subject matter. Critics have been found with so little feeling
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_12:0.0000:for poetic effects as to find fault with The Cloud on account of its cease-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_13:0.0000:less changing of comparisons ; but no doubt they would think badly of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_14:0.0000:nature herself for the fickleness of her clouds. What has a poet to do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_15:0.0250:with profound lessons when writing an inspired ode to a skylark ? Those
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_16:0.0000:who answer nothing, he should give himself up to an intoxicating
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_17:0.0000:beauty, are disciples of Shelley : but whoever replies, beauty finds its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_18:0.0250:perfect work only as the hand-maiden of right living, are Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_21:0.0250:diminishing spiral curve, as if climbing to heaven by a circular stair case :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_22:0.0000:on the top of this imaginary conical tower the bird pauses to flood the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_23:0.0000:morning earth with song : frequently the bird is invisible, (having passed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_24:0.0500:the point where it subtends the necessary angle for visibility) while its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_25:0.0500:strong melodious voice is easily audible.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_27:0.0000:mundane concerns in its ecstasy of worship, but in fact he is no mere
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_28:0.0000:ascetic, for on the ground far below is a little nest, (often in the imprint
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_29:0.0250:of a horse's hoof or a similar depression) containing his little feathered
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_30:0.0000:offspring, usually four or five in number. It is his love for these as much
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_31:0.0000:as his gratitude for sunlight and glorious skies that prompts his music,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0287_32:0.0250:though one might fancy him to disregard the leafy earth and all therein.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_1:0.0250:ODE TO DUTY. Page 95.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_4:0.0250:Horace's Ode to Fortune (0 Diva Gratum, I, 35), and Gray's Ode to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_5:0.0000:Adversity are the poems upon which the poet tells us he modelled the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_6:0.0000:Ode to Duty. While the three odes have a general resemblance, both in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_7:0.0000:the calm dignity and thoughtful ardour of their matter, and in a corre-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_8:0.0000:sponding regularity and seriousness of form, the differences are quite
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_9:0.0000:marked. The great sane nobility of the polished pagan shows no touch
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_10:0.0000:of levity where levity would be forced, and the seriousness of Horace
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_11:0.0000:has the pathos of a cheerful writer, a pathos free from suspicion of mere
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_12:0.0250:dramatic effect.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_16:0.0250:" white-robed Faith, so seldom found," and the ode ends in a prayer for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_27:0.0000:ing and most elevated stanza, there is not lacking in this piece a modern
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_28:0.0250:spirit of love and forgiveness rarely met with in the ancient writings.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0288_29:0.0500:In versification the resemblance between the two English poems will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_1:0.0500:To praise the Ode to Duty is as needless as to praise Shakespeare's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_2:0.0000:plays. Yet there is a danger that one may overlook some of its great
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_3:0.0000:qualities through enthusiasm over the others. The acuteness and com-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_4:0.0000:prehensiveness of intellect, which draws a clear line between freedom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_5:0.0000:and mere license, and finds perfect liberty in a proud submission, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_6:0.0000:goodness of heart and will which accepts the implied restrictions with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_7:0.0000:enthusiastic cheerfulness, the vigour of imagination which sees the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_8:0.0000:universal law at work among those young- eyed cherubs the stars of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_9:0.0000:heaven, the poetry that personifies the abstraction and clothes it with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_10:0.0000:magnetic beauty, and withal the humility, the sweetness and light, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_11:0.0000:virility of this poem give it a rank that seems to us unassailable from
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_12:0.0000:even the most remote and dissimilar points of view, so that one can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_13:0.0250:imagine Shakespeare, Horace or Plato reading it with as great pleasure
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_14:0.0500:as Lowell or Matthew Arnold.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_15:0.0500:2. "Stern Daughter of the Voice of God." Compare from the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_16:0.0000:Ode to Adversity "daughter of Jove" and "stern, rugged nurse."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_17:0.0000:The appropriateness of the expression "of the voice of God" will be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_18:0.0000:seen when one reflects that the Christian view of the Deity would for-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_19:0.0000:bid the expression precisely analogous to Gray's. Voice means expressed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_20:0.0000:will, Daughter is required for personification. Observe the economy of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_21:0.0500:the order which gives us the concrete image in the first line and the ab-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_22:0.0250:stract interpretation in the second.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_28:0.0250:produce untold disaster ; the comparison is not meant to be strictly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0289_29:0.0000:scientific, of course. A law is merely a generalized statement of facts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_2:0.0250:"To the attentive and competent reader the whole sufficiently ex
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_3:0.0000:plains itself," says Wordsworth in speaking of this famous Ode. There
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_4:0.0000:is a general inclination among commentators to accept this saying and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_5:0.0000:to consider all readers attentive and competent. Coleridge (quoted by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_6:0.0000:Mr. Rolfe) says "The ode was intended for such readers only as had
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_7:0.0000:been accustomed to watch the flux and reflux of their inmost nature, to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_8:0.0000:venture at times into the twilight realms of consciousness, and to feel a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_9:0.0000:deep interest in the modes of inmost being, to which they know that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_10:0.0000:the attributes of time and space are inapplicable and alien, but which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_11:0.0000:yet cannot be conveyed, save in symbols of time and space." So that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_12:0.0250:if any youthful reader should find that the piece does not "sufficiently
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_13:0.0000:explain itself" he may justly conclude that his incompetency arises
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_14:0.0000:from an insufficient watching of the flux and reflux of his inmost nature,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_15:0.0000:and an ignorance of metaphysics in general , or, to speak more clearly,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_16:0.0000:instead of being discouraged in proportion as he is befogged, he may
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_17:0.0000:rest assured that the years that bring the philosophic mind will bring
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_18:0.0000:as well his competency to grasp the meaning of this philosophical ode.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_19:0.0000:The estimate of Matthew Arnold will be found on page 24 of this book
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_20:0.0000:and deserves careful reading. It is 011 the whole an adverse verdict :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_21:0.0000:that is to say it tends to lower the general opinion of great men as to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_22:0.0000:the rank of the poem. It has great weight as coming from a man of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_23:0.0000:great ability who was a devoted admirer of Wordsworth ; still even
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_24:0.0000:Matthew Arnold errs sometimes and we should rather enquire as to the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_25:0.0000:truth of his views than accept them because they are his, especially
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_26:0.0000:since Emerson, whom Arnold revered, takes a view quite opposed to his.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_27:0.0500:First of all one should observe that Arnold objects not to the poetry,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_28:0.0500:but to the philosophy of life, which he finds in the ode. Wordsworth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_30:0.0000:"To that dream-like vividness and splendour which invest objects of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_31:0.0000:sight in childhood, every one, I believe, if he would look back, could bear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_32:0.0000:testimony, and I need not dwell upon it here ; but having in the poem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_33:0.0000:regarded it as presumptive evidence of a prior state of existence, I think
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_34:0.0000:it right to protest against a conclusion, which has given pain to some
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_35:0.0000:good and pious persons, that I meant to inculcate such a belief. It is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_36:0.0000:far too shadowy a notion to he recommended to faith, as more than an
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_37:0.0000:element in our instincts of immortality. But let us bear in mind that,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_38:0.0000:though the idea is not advanced in revelation, there is nothing there
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_39:0.0250:to contradict it, and the fall of man presents an analogy in its favour,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0290_40:0.0250:Accordingly, a pre-existent state has entered into the popular creeds of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_1:0.0500:many nations, and, among all persons acquainted with classic literature,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_2:0.0000:is known as an ingredient in Platonic philosophy. Archimedes said
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_3:0.0000:that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_4:0.0000:machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_5:0.0250:of his own mind ? Having to wield some of its elements when I was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_6:0.0000:impelled to write this poem on the 'Immortality of the Soul,' / took
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_7:0.0000:hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_8:0.0000:humanity for authorizing me to make for my purpose the best use of it I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_11:0.0250:Of course the fact that the poet acknowledges the notion of pre-existence
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_12:0.0250:to be a mere speculation does not answer Arnold's criticism, but to re-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_13:0.0000:member the fact is to be in a better position for treating the author
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_14:0.0000:fairly. Arnold is a terrible critic, he brings the form of a poem into
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_15:0.0000:comparison with the chaste perfection of Greek art and the substance of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_16:0.0000:it into comparison with what he conceives to be absolute and eternal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_17:0.0000:truth. He judges this piece to be beautiful but to be lacking in that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_18:0.0000:absolute and established truthfulness which would make it a poem of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_19:0.0000:the highest order. It is not expedient here to argue this judgment, but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_20:0.0000:in order to account for the strange differences of opinion among the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_21:0.0000:ablest judges as to the value of its didactic import, it is only necessary
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_22:0.0000:to say that Matthew Arnold's views of truth were, in the respects that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_23:0.0000:make this ode important, so far from those of many other critics, that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_24:0.0000:agreement was out of the question : and it may be confidently asserted
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_25:0.0000:that if no work can stand as great poetry which is founded on beliefs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_26:0.0500:concerning other states of life not held by Matthew Arnold, some very
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_28:0.0250:The line of thought in the poem is somewhat as follows : ( 1 ) The poet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_29:0.0000:laments his loss of "that dream-like vividness and splendour " with
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_30:0.0000:which children see things about them : (2) Of course he sees that a rain-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_31:0.0000:bow or a rose, the moon, water by starlight, sunshine, are beautiful, but
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_32:0.0000:their magic loveliness he cannot realize any more : (3) Under the in-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_33:0.0000:fluence of a perfectly lovely day he shakes off the grief caused by the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_34:0.0000:joss of his childhood gift of perceiving beauty intensely : (4) He almost
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_35:0.0000:convinces himself that he has as deep a sense of the beauty of things as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_36:0.0000:lie ever had, but he has to confess again that the visionary gleam is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_37:0.0000:gone : (5) The fifth stanza (written two years later than the preceding
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_38:0.0000:four) begins to account for the loss of the " dream-like vividness and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_39:0.0500:splendour '' of childhood eyes ; it states that in passing from birth to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0291_40:0.0250:manhood, heaven largely dies out of the soul and the world takes its
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_1:0.0250:place : (6) The world is at enmity with our heavenly nature and seduces
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_2:0.0000:us to lower pleasures and interests : (7) The poet shows how wordly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_3:0.0000:affairs engross the being of the growing child, but declares that he only
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_4:0.0000:acts his parts in the soul of his soul he is allied to divinity still : (8
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_5:0.0000:He apostrophizes the child and asks him why he seeks to know the world
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_6:0.0000:when it would be true wisdom to rest content with the beautiful soul he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_7:0.0000:brought from heaven : (9) He expresses deep joy that even the most
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_8:0.0000:seducing wordly interests can never quite destroy the divine nature in a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_9:0.0000:man, and that every man has at times intimations of his heavenly origin :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_10:0.0000:(10) He again surrenders himself to &ie influence of a perfectly lovely
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_11:0.0000:day, (stanza 3) and says that though he cannot feel the pure joy in beauty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_12:0.0000:that he could before the world had claimed so much of him, yet he feels
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_13:0.0000:that the centre of his soul is in sympathy with that pure joy, and what
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_14:0.0000:he has lost of it is to some extent compensated by a deep human sym-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_15:0.0000:pathy, (which he could never have had without being to some degree
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_16:0.0000:worldly) and by a faith that when the world at last loses it power, he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_17:0.0000:will return to perfect bliss : ( 1 1 ) In conclusion, the poet weighs his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_18:0.0000:gains and losses since childhood ; he has lost the glory and the freshness
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_19:0.0000:of his childhood perceptions ; he has retained a great love of beauty
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_20:0.0000:and a profound sympathy with heaven-born childhood and nature ; he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_21:0.0000:has gained through worldly experience, love, human sympathy, thought-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_22:0.0000:fulness, sad perhaps, but a divine sort of melancholy, such as Milton
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_23:0.0250:loved : he does not strike a balance, but concludes in a tone of cultured
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_24:0.0500:repose.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_25:0.0000:The comprehension of this line of thought depends chiefly upon the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_26:0.0000:clearness with which one conceives the "celestial light" in which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_27:0.0000:children behold the common objects around them : and how this magic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_28:0.0000:way of seeing disappears as years advance. It is probably one of those
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_29:0.0000:graces of nature that most fear to mention for fear of missing a sym-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0292_30:0.0500:pathetic ear : yet in Wordsworth it was so positively developed that he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_20:0.0250:graded us there is something of divine vitality ; I rejoice that nature
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_33:0.0000:this satisfactorily ; he speaks of the opening stanza of We Are Seven,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_34:0.0000:and adds: " But it was not so much from feelings of animal vivacity
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_35:0.0000:that my difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_36:0.0000:spirit within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch and Elijah,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_37:0.0500:and almost to persuade myself that, whatever might become of others,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_38:0.0500:I should be translated, in something of the same way, to heaven. With
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_2:0.0000:as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_3:0.0000:something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_4:0.0000:Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to re-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_5:0.0000:call myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality. At that time I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_6:0.0000:was afraid of such processes. In later periods of life I have deplored,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0295_7:0.0000:as we have all reason to do, a subjugation of an opposite character, and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_0:0.0500:278 WORDSWORTH.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_18:0.0250:"With Wordsworth, Nature is no mere machine. There is, he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_30:0.0000:to Professor Shairp's interpretation of his meaning, Nature, though mani-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_31:0.0000:festing itself in various forms, is pervaded by a unity of life and power,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_32:0.0000:binding it together into one living whole, and possessing an influence
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_33:0.0000:which streams through and stimulates man's life a spirit itselt in-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_34:0.0500:visible, though it speaks through visible forms. Its calmness stills and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0296_35:0.0250:refreshes man ; its sublimity raises his spirit to noble and energetic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_1:0.0000:thoughts, and its tenderness, striving in the largest and loftiest things
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_2:0.0000:condescends to the lowest, and is in the humblest worm and weed as in
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_3:0.0000:the great movements of the elements and of the stars. Its stability and
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_4:0.0000:order, too, satisfy his intellect and calm his soul. Our mind, receiving
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_5:0.0000:these impressions, adds to them its own thoughts and feelings, and this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_12:0.0250:"After five long years the poet once more looks upon the syl-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_13:0.0000:van Wye. Nor, during that absence among far other scenes, has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_14:0.0000:the memory of a spot so beautiful and quiet ever left him. Nay, more,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_15:0.0000:it may be that to the unconscious influence of those beauteous forms he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_16:0.0000:owes the highest of his poetic moods that mood in which the soul
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_17:0.0250:transcends the world of sense, and views the world of being and the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_18:0.0000:mysterious harmony of the universe. He believes that this is so ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_19:0.0250:at least he knows how often the memory of this quiet beauty has
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_20:0.0000:cheered the dreariness of life and soothed its fever.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_22:0.0500:and his present sensations mingle with his past, not without a painful
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_23:0.0250:feeling that the past has in a measure faded and belongs to his former
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_24:0.0500:self, yet feeling that the joy of the present moment will recur through
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_27:0.0250:same all-sufficing passion for the mere external forms and colours of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_28:0.0000:nature, is no longer filled with the same gladness of mere animal life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_29:0.0000:yet Nature has not forsaken, but only fulfilled her kindly purpose to-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_30:0.0000:wards her worshipper. Taught by her, he has reached a more serene
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_31:0.0250:and higher region ; higher because more human in its interest, more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_32:0.0500:thoughtful in its nature, more moral in its object.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_33:0.0000:" And even if he had not reached this higher mood, none the less by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_34:0.0000:sympathy with his sister could he feel the full joys of his former self.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_35:0.0250:That she should now be as he was then is his wish and prayer ; for
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_36:0.0250:doubtless she too will be led by Nature, who never leaves her task in-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_37:0.0000:complete, to the higher and more tranquil mood which is the ripe fruit
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_38:0.0250:of former flowers. And so, whatever sorrows might befall her in after
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_39:0.0000:times, both he and she could with joy remember that Nature by such
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0297_40:0.0000:scenes and by his aid had wrought in her an unfailing source of com-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_12:0.0500:82-90. This sounds like the language of a lover concerning the glories
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_13:0.0000:of love or of Sir Galahad concerning religious transports. To Words-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_14:0.0000:worth this passion for Nature was what love and religion are to many
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_15:0.0000:the passion that seizes and vehemently controls all the faculties. This
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_16:0.0000:is the best note we have on the " celestial light " of his great Ode.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_31:0.0500:Wordsworth that much true poetry is to be found in the language of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_35:0.0000:schoolmaster of some village school; and probably from what we can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0298_36:0.0000:learn he resembles mure or less closely some master known by the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_22:0.0000:John. This poem may be profitably compared with Shelley's following
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_23:0.0000:it (in the Golden Treasury}. Each is the most complete expression of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_24:0.0000:the innermost spirit of his art given by these great poets : of that idea
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_25:0.0000:which, as in the case of the true painter (to quote the words of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_26:0.0000:.Reynold's), subsists only in the mind : the sight never beheld it, nor
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_27:0.0000:has the hand expressed it : it is an idea residing in the breast of the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_9:0.0000:impossible, he all but enables us to grasp the indefinable halo that
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_10:0.0000:genius alone discerns about the objects it contemplates that golden
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_11:0.0000:illusion that flits away from common sense to perfect wisdom. That
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_20:0.0250:magic light," all these point to the same mystery. Other expressions
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_21:0.0000:of it occur in Wordsworth, notably in the Ode on Immortality : and of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_22:0.0250:course it is what Sir Joshua tries to say in the note above ; but no one
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_28:0.0000:been a glorious idealist, but no mere dreamer, had awaked from an illu-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_29:0.0000:sion and had told his dream ; the reasonableness, the nobility, the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_30:0.0250:romance, the God-like enthusiasm for the best the world aspires to, are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_31:0.0000:told with a poetic grace and a persuasive logic that go far to convert the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_32:0.0000:reader, against his knowledge,, into a Revolutionist of the year '89. The
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_33:0.0000:astounding skill of this as a defence of what he regards perhaps as a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_34:0.0000:youthful error, is greatly enhanced by his own attitude in the poem, not
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_35:0.0000:the least hint of retraction or apology is evinced, but rather he would
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_36:0.0250:say, ' ' Had I resisted the glamour of it, would I not have been less a

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_12:0.0500:tarch's Lycargus, Campanella's Gity of the Sun, Hall's Mundus Altes et
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_13:0.0500:Idem. Montaigne deals with the same subject in his famous Essays.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_19:0.0250:the lawyer, the doctor of divinity, the soldier, the doctor of medicine,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_20:0.0000:the student of natural philosophy, and the student of moral philosophy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_21:0.0000:as approaching the poet's grave ; each in turn is dismissed as unworthy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_22:0.0000:of the right even to pay his respects to the hallowed poetic dust : fin-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_23:0.0250:ally a poet approaches the resting-place of his brother bard, and is
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_24:0.0500:warmly welcomed and bid to come, go, and remain at will.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_25:0.0500:In his enthusiasm to express the central idea that the poet is the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_26:0.0250:noblest of mankind the author has neglected to lend grace to the form
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_27:0.0000:of his work, hence its stiffness and monotony, not to say narrowness, of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_28:0.0000:tone : in these respects it does not bear comparison with Burns' Sard's
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_29:0.0000:Epitaph, upon which it is modelled : it is difficult to defend an inferior
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_30:0.0500:imitation.

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_12:0.0500:Wordsworth published between three and four hundred sonnets,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_13:0.0250:Shakespeare one hundred and fifty -four, Milton only twenty-three., of
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_14:0.0000:which six are Italian. The chief subjects of Wordsworth's sonnets are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_15:0.0000:Liberty, Church History, and thoughts suggested by Nature ; many,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_16:0.0000:however, have other subjects. His mastery over this form of verse is so
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_17:0.0000:complete that it may be compared to an instrument which he command-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_18:0.0000:ed so entirely as to make it express his mind perfectly. It is well
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_19:0.0000:known that as a versifier he was very unequal : it would be absurd to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_20:0.0000:say that the poet who wrote Yarrow Revisited and the Ode on Immortal-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_21:0.0000:ity was not a versifier, yet from wrong theories or other causes his
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_22:0.0000:poetry is often crude in form and unmusical : it may have been on ac-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_23:0.0000:count of his limitations as an inventor of forms that he used the sonnet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_24:0.0000:so often. Still, it was natural that a writer of profound reflective
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_25:0.0000:power should seize upon this simple conventional form as a ready mould
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_26:0.0000:for his thoughts.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_28:0.0000:especially a love-song. It became limited, however, to poems of four-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_31:0.0500:The name is now applied to two principal forms, which may for con-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_32:0.0000:venience be called the Shakespearean and the recent. These classes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_33:0.0000:have two characteristics in common both require that the sub-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_34:0.0000:ject-matter shall consist of one complete thought or sentiment,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_35:0.0250:and both require that the form should be fourteen iambic
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_36:0.0000:pentameters. The Shakespearean sonnet differed from recent son-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_37:0.0250:nets in rhyme-arrangement, Shakespeare's sonnets having the ar-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_1:0.0250:rangement ababcdcdefe f y g, while recent sonnets follow the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_2:0.0000:arrangement abbaabbacdcdcd (allowing, however, some lati-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_3:0.0000:tude in the arrangement of the c d rhymes). There is another
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_4:0.0000:important difference also, not so easy to define. The Shakesperean son-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_5:0.0000:net usually consists of some poetical symbol and the application of it to
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_6:0.0000:the main thought : the symbol occupies the twelve lines of alternate
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_7:0.0000:rhyme, and the application the rhyming couplet at the end, so that one
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_8:0.0000:may usually get the main thought by merely reading this concluding
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_9:0.0000:couplet. The recent sonnets are different in this respect, the division
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_10:0.0000:between the symbol and the application (when these occur) usually being
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_11:0.0000:at the end of the octave. Frequently, however, the octave explains the
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_12:0.0000:whole thought, while the sestet is used for some quiet reflection upon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_13:0.0000:that thought. The recent sonnets are modelled upon the Italian sonnet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_14:0.0000:used by Milton. The examples chosen to illustrate these truths are
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_15:0.0250:chosen as striking examples of their classes, and as likely to illustrate
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_26:0.0500:ON HIS BLINDNESS.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_1:0.0250:It will be observed that even Milton does not show so marked a turn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_2:0.0000:at the ninth line as the later poets. It has been said that Milton's son-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_3:0.0000:nets shoot rapidly off like a rocket, and then fall, breaking in a shower
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_4:0.0000:of brightness ; some of them, however, have been more aptly described
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_5:0.0000:as a trumpet call to duty. The recent sonnets have been well compared
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_6:0.0250:to a waving rising (in the octave) and gently subsiding &s the thought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0307_7:0.0250:spends itself in beauty. One of the most perfect of the latter class is

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_3:0.0250:tude of men and women in many lands. Since the publica-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_4:0.0500:tion of her first little book of lyrics twenty years ago, her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_7:0.0250:In Sara Teasdale we find a purely American poet. She

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_10:0.0000:and one ancestor, Major Simon Willard, was founder of Con-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_11:0.0250:cord, Massachusetts. About the middle of the nineteenth
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_12:0.0000:century both her maternal and paternal grandfathers followed
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_13:0.0000:the tide of migration to the Middle West. One became the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_14:0.0500:owner of steamboats on the Mississippi and the other, true to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_15:0.0250:his family tradition, a Baptist minister. From this background
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_16:0.0250:of Puritan and pioneer heritage emerged the poet who has
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_17:0.0000:voiced the inarticulate feelings of men and women everywhere.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_18:0.0000:The youngest of several children, and not strong, Sara Teas-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_19:0.0000:dale grew up as a shy, imaginative child. Once when asked
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_20:0.0000:when she first really enjoyed poetry she answered, "My mother
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_21:0.0000:like everybody else's mother, has incredible tales of my reciting
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_22:0.0000:every jingle in 'Mother Goose' at an infinitesimal age. But for
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_23:0.0000:the poetry that everyone would agree is worthy of being called
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_24:0.0000:so, Christina Rossetti's 'Christmas Carol,' was probably the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_25:0.0000:first that I loved. I have included it in RAINBOW GOLD. It
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_26:0.0000:begins, 'In the bleak midwinter, frosty winds made moan.'
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_27:0.0000:I think I liked it better than other poems partly because snow
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_28:0.0000:is mentioned in it. I used to stand at the window during a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0007_29:0.0000:snow-storm literally enchanted by the music of the lines."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_0:0.0500:verse included translations from Heine and other German
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_5:0.0000:with several of her friends undertook the publication of a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_6:0.0000:monthly magazine called "The Potter's Wheel." This unique
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_7:0.0250:publication was limited to one copy each month and was entirely
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_8:0.0250:in manuscript with original illustrations in photograph, black
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_9:0.0250:and white, and in color. Friends of the contributors showed much
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_10:0.0500:interest in the magazine w r hich continued for several years.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_12:0.0000:reader and one of her special treasures is a fat note-book in
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_16:0.0000:several winters in California and the Southwest. Her first
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_17:0.0000:journey to Europe came in 1905. For some time she remained
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_18:0.0250:in Southern Europe and the near East, visiting Greece, Egypt
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_19:0.0000:and the Holy Land. During this period she was writing verse
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_20:0.0000:and upon her return in 1907 had her first recognition from the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_21:0.0000:noted William Marion Reedy who published her blank verse
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_22:0.0000:monologue "Guenevere" in Reedy's Mirror. This same year her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_23:0.0000:SONNETS TO DUSE AND OTHER POEMS was published by the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_24:0.0500:Poet Lore Company of Boston. In England the famous critic,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_25:0.0500:Arthur Symons, reviewing it for the London Saturday Review,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_29:0.0500:Duse. The sonnets to Madame Duse are hardly the best part
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_30:0.0500:of the book, for they speak and the lyrics sing; but they speak
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_31:0.0500:with a reverence whiph is filled with both tenderness and just
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0008_32:0.0500:admiration.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_3:0.0250:zines and her poems were welcomed by Harper's, Scribner's,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_4:0.0000:The Century and others. In 1911 HELEN OF TROY AND OTHER
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_6:0.0500:remained a favorite and was recently reissued. In "The New
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_7:0.0000:Era in American Poetry," Louis Untermeyer says, "Helen of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_9:0.0250:guese Nun), Guenevere, Erinna (pale Erinna of the perfect
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_10:0.0000:lyre; Sappho's favorite pupil) these are all made to live in
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_11:0.0000:blank verse so musical that it has an almost lyric intensity.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_12:0.0250:Classical in subject, the treatment is modern. The figures are
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_13:0.0500:vitalized by a new interpretation that is as penetrating as it is
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_17:0.0500:which have become such universal favorites. Here are the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_26:0.0250:feeling in it, and the genuine beauty? It is the very simplicity
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_17:0.0000:for a rounded estimate of a poet whose songs give the woman's
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_18:0.0000:version of the human love-story, or at least as much of it as
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_19:0.0000:one of the finer, more sensitive, and protected women of our
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_20:0.0000:veiled and walled-in civilization may contribute to the whole
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_24:0.0250:the title LOVE SONGS, and to it was awarded the Columbia
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_25:0.0500:University-Poetry Society of America Prize for the best book
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_26:0.0000:of poems published that year. The unusual popularity of this
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_27:0.0500:volume was proved by more than five editions in 1918 and the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_0:0.0500:richer by many lovely things unknown before. One wanders
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_6:0.0250:bestowed on it from all sides. In this book the writer shows
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_7:0.0000:a maturing technique and both in thought and feeling covers
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_8:0.0000:a wider range than in her earlier volumes. "Here are new
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_9:0.0250:rhythms, far more subtle than those she has employed before ;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_10:0.0000:here are words chosen with a keener sense of their actual as
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_11:0.0250:well as their musical value; here the line moves with metrical
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_12:0.0000:inevitability. Radiance plays round these verses," wrote Louis
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_24:0.0000:A beautiful edition of FLAME AND SHADOW was published
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_25:0.0000:in England in 1924 by Jonathan Cape. This was well reviewed
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_26:0.0000:by the critics as another section of this booklet shows. The
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_27:0.0000:London Times greeted the book and said in part "FLAME
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_28:0.0000:AND SHADOW reveals her in the maturity of her powers. Be-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_29:0.0000:cause Sara Teasdale is a poet whose achievement lies rather in
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_30:0.0250:the perfect articulation of a mood than in any voyaging through
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_31:0.0000:strange seas in quest of universals, she gains everything by being

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_2:0.0500:its spirited decorations by Dugald Walker was hailed by critics,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_3:0.0500:parents, and children alike. Here are eighty of the finest treas-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_4:0.0500:ures of English and American verse with old and new poets
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_6:0.0000:"I should not have entered this field," said Miss Teasdale,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_7:0.0000:"if I had not felt that there is a real need for a smaller book,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_8:0.0000:with contents more rigourously chosen, than any I have seen.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_9:0.0000:Such a book as RAINBOW GOLD is easier for the child to hold,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_10:0.0000:and easier to become intimate with, than a large book. The
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_11:0.0000:intimacy which is most likely to instil a love of poetry as a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_12:0.0000:whole, scarcely can be attained in a volume containing a great
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_13:0.0000:number of poems. Poetry is the most intimate of the arts. It
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_14:0.0000:should be the possession of the child by himself. A child should
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_15:0.0000:enjoy a poem just as he enjoys a ride in an automobile, without
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_16:0.0500:needing to understand the mechanism of the machine and with-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_17:0.0000:out needing to know what was in the inventor's mind."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_22:0.0250:Review, Elinor Wylie said: "Sara Teasdale has turned the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_23:0.0000:clock back a sufficient number of years and allowed her own
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_24:0.0000:childhood to decide for her under the wise but scrupulously re-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_25:0.0000:strained guidance of a woman of high poetic gifts and dis-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_26:0.0000:tinguished critical judgment. ... I should not ask a better
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_27:0.0000:fate than to be a child to whom these most adorable toys, these
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_28:0.0000:pictures and trumpets and magic rings were given for the first
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_29:0.0000:time, unless it were to be that of the supremely lucky one, who,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_30:0.0250:having long and painfully toiled to discover some part of the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_31:0.0000:treasures among a number of heavy tomes and discouraging
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_32:0.0000:complexities of print, suddenly found himself the possessor of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_33:0.0250:them all, bound up with many more in nice blue covers and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_34:0.0250:shining clearly upon a page worthy of such delights."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0012_36:0.0250:[8]
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_0:0.0500:has friends and many admirers of her poetry. In 1924 she went
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_1:0.0000:to France and here the "Pictures of Autumn" included in her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_2:0.0000:next volume were written. Not until 1926 did that book appear,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_3:0.0250:published in the autumn and called DARK OF THE MOON.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_4:0.0000:Here may be found the qualities which one expects in her,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_5:0.0000:but enriched by deeper thought and more varied music. Her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_6:0.0000:work has shown a constant growth in artistry, with no loss of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_7:0.0000:that lyric spontaneity, that exquisite and inherent gift of sing-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_8:0.0000:ing which has distinguished her from the start. The limited edi-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_9:0.0000:tion of this book was entirely sold before publication and the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_10:0.0000:volume went through several large printings before the end
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_11:0.0000:of the year, being mentioned on lists of "best sellers." Excerpts
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_12:0.0500:from the many notable reviews of the book are included in an-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_15:0.0250:to music. Among the composers who have made musical settings
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_16:0.0250:for her work are Amy M. Beach, Katherine Glen, Wintter
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_17:0.0500:Watts, Mabel Wood Hill, and Rudolf Ganz. Her poems have
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_18:0.0000:been translated into many foreign languages. A volume of her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_19:0.0250:lyrics, translated into German by Dr. Rudolf Rieder, is to be
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_22:0.0250:lated and published in Japan a delightful volume of Miss
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_23:0.0250:Teasdale's poems. The book begins in oriental fashion at the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_24:0.0000:back. Printed in vertical lines in the delicate Japanese charac-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_25:0.0500:ters, the poems seem like trailing wistaria. Other Japanese
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_26:0.0250:translations have been made by Yaso Saijiyou, considered by
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_27:0.0500:many people the foremost poet of Japan, and selections from
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0013_28:0.0500:DARK OF THE MOON have been translated by a young poet,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_0:0.0250:poet is conscious of what is tormenting him. The irritation
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_1:0.0250:springs, probably, from subconscious combinations of partly
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_2:0.0000:forgotten thoughts and feelings. Coming together, like electrical
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_3:0.0000:currents in a thunder storm, they produce a poem. A poem
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_4:0.0000:springs from emotions produced by an actual experience, or
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_5:0.0000:almost as forcefully, from those caused by an imaginary ex-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_6:0.0250:perience. In either case, the poem is written to free the poet
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_7:0.0500:from an emotional burden."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_9:0.0000:the basic idea emerges sometimes slowly, sometimes in a flash.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_10:0.0000:This idea is known at once to be the light toward which the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_11:0.0000:poet was groping. He now walks round and round it, so to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_12:0.0000:speak, looking at it from all sides, trying to see which aspect of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_13:0.0000:it is the most vivid. When he has hit upon what he believes
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_14:0.0000:is his peculiar angle of vision, the poem is fairly begun. The
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_15:0.0000:first line comes floating toward him with a charming definite-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_16:0.0000:ness of color and music. In my own case, the poems being
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_17:0.0000:brief, the rhythm usually follows in a general way, the rhythm
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_18:0.0000:of the first line. The more swiftly the poem forms itself, the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_19:0.0500:better it is likely to be. This does not mean that a polishing
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_20:0.0000:process may not be long and sometimes disheartening."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_22:0.0250:They are far more fluid before they touch ink and paper than
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_23:0.0000:they ever are afterward. The warmth of the idea that gener-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_24:0.0000:ated the poem should vary the music and make the verses
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_25:0.0250:clear, ductile, a finished whole before they touch cold white
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_26:0.0000:paper. In the process of moulding his idea, the poet will be at
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_27:0.0000:white heat of intellectual and emotional activity, bearing in mind
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_28:0.0000:that every word, every syllable, must be an unobstrusive and yet
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_29:0.0000:an indispensable part of his creation. Every beat of his rhythm,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_30:0.0000:the color of each word, the ring of each rhyme, must conform in-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_31:0.0250:evitably to his feeling. By shaping his poem with perfect exacti-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_32:0.0000:tude to hold his emotion, he fulfills his subconscious aim in
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_33:0.0000:its composition. He sets himself free by pouring his thought
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_34:0.0000:into a form which holds it completely, and in which he can con-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0014_35:0.0500:template it as a thing apart from himself."

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_4:0.0250:The Bookman contains a brief pen picture of Sara Teasdale,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_5:0.0000:and it is here quoted in part: "A quiet, gentle voiced lady
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_6:0.0000:with hair between red and gold is Sara Teasdale. She seldom
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_7:0.0000:seeks company, yet sees her friends often ; her chief surprise for
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_8:0.0000:the acquaintance is her sudden sallies of droll and even biting
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_9:0.0250:wit. This one finds but unfrequently in her poems. . . . She
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_10:0.0250:is a woman of poise and a poet of great distinction. ... A
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_11:0.0000:wise heart, vision, a sense of beauty in simple things ; these are
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_12:0.0000:hers, and added to them an intellectual grasp of the technique
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0015_13:0.0250:of verse which gives her the ability to conceive in sentiment

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_3:0.0250:her own impulse, influenced not at all by changing fash-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_4:0.0250:ions, but rather by changing experiences in a constantly deepen-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_5:0.0250:ing life. Her early books, HELEN OF TROY, RIVERS TO THE SEA
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_6:0.0250:and LOVE SONGS, were in the main the embodiment of the joy
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_7:0.0000:of a young poet in her first vivid contacts and realizations.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_8:0.0000:To be sure, there were pensive songs and sad songs and songs of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_9:0.0000:unrest, but these songs had at heart a curative joy, a healthy
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_10:0.0250:vitality. In them all there lurked an assurance, an inner convic-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_14:0.0250:Teasdale's early volumes, and LOVE SONGS, one is instantly
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_15:0.0000:a thrall to that delight, that winged uplift, which true lyric
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_16:0.0000:poetry always gives. Even the slightest of the songs has this
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_17:0.0000:power to exhilarate which is the supreme test of poetry. This
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_18:0.0000:joy, this ecstacy of expression, must impel the poet before it
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_19:0.0000:can move the hearer; and Sara Teasdale's work is always born
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_20:0.0250:of this inner compulsion, hence its unfailing hold upon her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_21:0.0500:readers.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_27:0.0250:lyric poet, those which show new fecundity, rarely exceed a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0016_31:0.0250:[12]
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_0:0.0500:offers a strong refutation. In fact, between the poet of LOVE
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_1:0.0000:SONGS and DARK OF THE MOON so great a development is
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_2:0.0250:apparent as to show almost a new personality. All of the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_3:0.0250:qualities of the earlier work are here, but tempered, enriched,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_4:0.0000:remolded. The single theme has given place to the symphonic,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_5:0.0000:wrought upon a basic note of "the still, sad music of humanity."
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_6:0.0000:Even in the most personal experience, interblended life utters
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_7:0.0250:its tone, so that one hears through the voice of the poet the many
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_23:0.0250:This 'poem, so magical in its brooding music, delaying in its
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_24:0.0250:very notes as one delays who contemplates the thing that is
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_25:0.0250:inevitable and yet arrested is the work of a poet still young, as
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_26:0.0500:time is counted, of one whose autumn is yet distant but who
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_27:0.0500:feels the prescience of change and withdrawal as Masefield
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_28:0.0250:felt it when, though hardly at his prime, he wrote the ex-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_29:0.0500:quisite lines:
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_4:0.0250:in proportion to the keenness of the passion with which a poet
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_5:0.0250:has felt life will be his instinctive apprehension that the waning
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_6:0.0250:of the passion is at hand, and among the poets of our day none
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_7:0.0500:is keener in feeling, more emotionally sensitive, than Sara Teas-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_10:0.0250:swift and compelling, but the inalienable joy of beauty, the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_11:0.0500:one thing that survives though love fail and dynasties crumble.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_12:0.0000:Those who read her aright will be moved by the elation of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_13:0.0250:beauty, the love that is a primary passion, older than that which
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_14:0.0250:seeks its response in the human. Going back to the earliest
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_15:0.0500:songs one finds it beating in their music :
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_25:0.0500:run, how it surges with the joy of living! Rarely does Sara
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_26:0.0000:Teasdale write a poem, whatever its theme, but it has an inner
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_27:0.0000:theme, the reaching out for more of beauty, the longing for
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_33:0.0500:[14]
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_7:0.0000:that joy is always quick at its heart; that eagerness of living,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_8:0.0000:or understanding, even of suffering, beats so insistently in it.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_9:0.0000:It is this which lifts even the songs in a minor key into the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_10:0.0000:major harmony of poetry. The poet must not only accept, he
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_11:0.0000:must invite the thrust of pain, knowing that he is sheathed
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_12:0.0000:in love and invulnerable through beauty. When one reads Sara
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_13:0.0000:Teasdale's poetry, even though the song be sad, one is con-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_14:0.0000:scious of that inner valor, that affirmation, which confirms his
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_15:0.0000:own faith and says "Yea" to life. The poet who has resolved
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_16:0.0000:life into its meaning will find that all its notes blend to a rich
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_17:0.0000:diapason. It is a music not to be compassed by one singer,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_18:0.0000:but each one, to whatever degree he approaches it, is lifted into
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_19:0.0000:rapture. It is in this sense that "the song is to the singer and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_20:0.0000:comes back most to him," returning in the enrichment of joy.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_21:0.0000:Each poet has his way of approach to the realization of life,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_22:0.0000:and with Sara Teasdale it has been largely through love. Per-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_23:0.0000:haps the psychology of love and its evolution could not be traced
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_24:0.0000:more subtly than through her successive volumes. To generalize
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_25:0.0000:is misleading, since there is always the exception that seems to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_26:0.0000:refute the premise, but in the main one will find the volumes
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_27:0.0000:up to the appearance of FLAME AND SHADOW to have been the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_28:0.0000:demand of life for its fulfilment in love. In the earliest verse
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_29:0.0000:this demand overshadows all others; it is the urge of youth
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_30:0.0000:for its destiny and inspires in Sara Teasdale some of the most
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_31:0.0000:exquisite and impassioned of her songs. How one would like to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_32:0.0000:quote them to show how perfectly the emotion creates its ex-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_33:0.0000:pression, how every word falls true! It is interesting also to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_0:0.0250:cess," of poetry, they have the instinctive restraint which holds
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_1:0.0000:it true to art. A lyric, if perfect, is conceived and created
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_2:0.0000:simultaneously. It can never be added to nor taken from. It has
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_3:0.0000:at once the quality of inevitability and the illusion of improvi-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_4:0.0250:sation. Particularly is this true of the work of Sara Teasdale
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_5:0.0250:in her most lyrical period. Whatever the theme, its expression
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_6:0.0000:seems to leap into being with it and one feels that it could not
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_7:0.0000:have come otherwise. Just as the earlier songs voice the urge
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_8:0.0250:of youth for its destiny, so they lament, as youth must lament,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_9:0.0000:that it is withheld. Upon this theme turn some of the loveliest
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_22:0.0500:than is possible in so brief a space as this to show how these
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_23:0.0500:moods of desire and reaction merge into the larger significance
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_24:0.0250:of love. Their foretokens are apparent in RIVERS TO THE SEA,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_25:0.0000:and LOVE SONGS, and in FLAME AND SHADOW they show a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_26:0.0250:progressive deepening, an increasing absorption of the personal
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_27:0.0000:in the universal; but it is in DARK OF THE MOON that they
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_31:0.0250:richly is it fused with all that maturer life brings as to make
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_0:0.0500:through which one focuses the whole of life. Most of us have
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_4:0.0250:a wide arc, an arc which subtends the whole of the circle.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_17:0.0500:Exquisite in its restraint and its artistry, with its music
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_18:0.0250:wedded to the mood, this poem is typical of the later beauty of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_19:0.0000:Sara Teasdale's work, a beauty if less obviously lyrical, per-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_20:0.0000:haps finer and more enduring. There is no loss of emotion, be-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_21:0.0000:cause it is tempered by knowledge and evoked by deeper delight.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_22:0.0000:The time has come to brood upon fruitions, to let go the un-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_23:0.0250:realized, to readjust the dream until it embraces with com-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_27:0.0250:by lighter notes, but when all is said, the finest lyric poetry
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_28:0.0000:comes from the deeps of life. The poet is reaching out for
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_29:0.0250:spiritual fulfilment, just as the poet of youth reaches out for
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_30:0.0000:physical fulfilment. Both are needed to make a balanced and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_31:0.0000:beautiful body of poetry, and both have had their full expres-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_32:0.0500:sion in the work of Sara Teasdale. Beauty is never sacrificed
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_4:0.0250:been the preoccupation of the poets, when they have gone to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_5:0.0000:any length to be "different," with a mistaken idea of individual-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_6:0.0000:izing themselves through the strained and bizarre, Sara Teas-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_7:0.0000:dale has held true to the lyric norm, to simplicity, sincerity, and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_8:0.0000:emotion, not thinking to hold true but doing it unconsciously as
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_9:0.0000:the poet does who is possessed by his genius. There has crept
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_10:0.0000:into poetry of late a strain of cleverness, an affectation of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_11:0.0000:cynicism. Some of the finest of the lyric poets, as far as ac-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_12:0.0000:complishment goes, obviously write with an eye to capturing
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_13:0.0000:an audience by their smartness; but did these poets ever stop to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_23:0.0500:Poetry is so in earnest as to forget itself. The poet speaks to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_25:0.0500:his audience does the world listen. So out of every generation,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_26:0.0000:out of the voluminous singing, comes the small residue of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_27:0.0250:poetry. With this residue, one may well believe, will be found
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_28:0.0000:the winnowed songs of Sara Teasdale, those which carry at

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_9:0.0000:they show, moreover, undeniable growth in the art. The poet's
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_10:0.0000:technique becomes much more subtle and varied; her choice of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_11:0.0000:words more exact and distinguished, and her rhythms more
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_12:0.0250:delicately harmonized. One gets an effect of increasing rich-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_15:0.0000:or other finely wrought detail. In "August Night" "dew-

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_13:0.0000:marriage have been dedicated; and the other, "The Crystal
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_14:0.0000:Gazer," offering with impassioned intensity her philosophy
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_15:0.0000:of life. Always these confessions have the firmly chiselled
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_16:0.0000:austerity of complete conviction. One finds neither doubt nor
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_17:0.0000:questioning in her feeling for the beloved or for the meaning
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_18:0.0000:of life: in the one case, if not ecstasy, a clear serenity of happi-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_19:0.0250:ness; in the other, a brave facing of the unknown immensities
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_0:0.0500:In earlier books, especially FLAME AND SHADOW, we have

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_4:0.0000:And lured to comparisons with her earlier work by the pub-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_5:0.0000:lisher's remark that this is "a book of deeper import, of wider
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_6:0.0000:contacts with living, than her earlier w r ork" one is struck
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_7:0.0000:not so much by that (for what it amounts to is that Miss
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_8:0.0000:Teasdale is not standing still), but by the continuity and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_9:0.0000:consistency of her growth, that it has been continuous and not
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_10:0.0000:a mere metamorphosis. ... In the present book Miss Teas-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_11:0.0000:dale does reveal new facets of her personality, one of them
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_12:0.0000:being a strength not only to face the universe (which she does
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_13:0.0000:not romanticize nor strive to bring nearer to the heart's precon-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_14:0.0500:ceptions), but a strength to face solitude.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_18:0.0000:appearance of her SONNETS TO DUSE in 1907, hers was a tri-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_19:0.0500:umphal progress through HELEN OF TROY Homer's Helen,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_20:0.0000:not Professor Erskine's and RIVERS TO THE SEA till that first
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_21:0.0000:decade culminated in "Love Songs" with the public recogni-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_22:0.0250:tion of the Columbia University prize. But the volume of 1920,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_23:0.0250:FLAME AND SHADOW, so far excels them all that, after these
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_24:0.0500:six waiting years, we hardly dare ask if the new volume regis-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_25:0.0500:ters a still higher attainment.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_28:0.0250:own testimony: "I try to say what moves me. I never care to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0028_29:0.0250:surprise my reader." Our surprise comes in finding our own
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_0:0.0250:next volume. Yet in DARK OF THE MOON, perhaps, she is more
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_1:0.0000:truly herself than ever she was before. Her esthetic doctrine
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_2:0.0000:of unflinching loyalty to the truth "as it is felt" has taught her
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_3:0.0250:how to give her times lyrics which, even when they are saddest,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_4:0.0000:have an ennobling clarity and sincerity, because they never veil
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_5:0.0000:or evade the hurt and hardness of life. Wherefore, as of old,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_6:0.0000:she finds more joy in sorrow than most of us ever find in joy.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_7:0.0500:And her music let glib theorists about meters be silent and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_13:0.0000:years. Her new collection of poems, DARK OF THE MOON,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_14:0.0250:captures the senses and the heart. These lyrics are deeper with
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_15:0.0000:meaning than many of her earlier songs. They are like a still
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_16:0.0000:stream of love, after a rushing torrent sometimes too cluttered
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_17:0.0250:with blossoms from the mountain bushes. Now her poems have
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_18:0.0000:a clearness, an always crystal beautv. They have lost none of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_24:0.0250:^J ing the riddle of the universe with song. It is not enough
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_25:0.0000:to say that Sara Teasdale has grown intellectually since the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_26:0.0000:publication of her earlier books and that in thought and feeling
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_27:0.0000:FLAME AND SHADOW is the finest of them all. We must, per-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_28:0.0000:force, acknowledge a growth in artistry. This is a book to read
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_29:0.0250:with reverence and joy, Although I seldom prophesy, I venture
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0029_30:0.0000:to say that it will have a long life.

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0030_3:0.0000:things entire. Miss Teasdale's glowing reputation will gain an
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0030_4:0.0250:added beauty by this volume.

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0031_22:0.0250:the authentic accent of genius. It is not too high praise to say
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0031_23:0.0250:that there is sufficient poetry in this small book to furnish forth
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0031_24:0.0000:a hundred volumes of the ordinary variety. . . . Not since
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0031_26:0.0500:a stronger essence of femininity into her verse.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_3:0.0000:shown; for these poems are so adapted to youthful
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_4:0.0000:moods that the phlegmatic as well as the fanciful child, the boy
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_5:0.0000:as well as the girl, can delight in them. Heroic lyrics, old bal-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_6:0.0000:lads, bits of fairy legend, and songs, plaintive and gentle as a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_7:0.0250:nurses's lullabies, are a vital part of a child's growing years.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_8:0.0000:The simple, the noble, the fiery things, are stuff of his thought
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_9:0.0250:for children's emotions are as lightly stirred as reeds by a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_10:0.0000:dragon fly. ... The author has shown fine insight. . . . And
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_11:0.0000:the effect of the poems is heightened by the vigor and magic of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_12:0.0000:Dugald Walker's illustrations. . . . Today Malory and Spen-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_13:0.0000:ser, Scott, Dickens, and the old poets are refurbished for the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_14:0.0000:young; instead of children turning in at the old gate to seek
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_15:0.0000:the real beauty and thought that lies beyond them. Well, here at
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_16:0.0250:last, are swift, bright paths leading to those gates, and clear
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_19:0.0250:RAINBOW GOLD is a book of treasure-verse. It begins with
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_21:0.0250:ends with "Auld Daddy Darkness," by James Ferguson. Be-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_22:0.0000:tween the two lies a wonder-world of imagery, lyrics, songs, and
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_23:0.0000:Dithyramb ... I believe, with Miss Teasdale, that the most
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_24:0.0250:important thing in the education of children is to stimulate
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0032_25:0.0500:their imagination and senses.

sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_15:0.0250:ing rhythms. To choose for quotation is harder than picking
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_16:0.0500:one daisy from a spring meadow but "The Tune" is a subtle
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_0:0.0250:THE TIDE of realism, colloquialism, and anarchism which
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_1:0.0000:Whitman set in motion has left her as untouched as the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_2:0.0000:austere manifestos of the "Imagists." And this is due, we think,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_3:0.0000:to her intensely personal preoccupation. The pure poet seldom
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_4:0.0000:goes out in search of new doctrines or flings himself into eman-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_5:0.0000:cipating movements. Absorbed in an inner prospect, he is glad
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_6:0.0250:to accept a traditional technique, so that he may concentrate
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_7:0.0000:all his energies on shaping it precisely to his needs and on defin-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_8:0.0000:ing in the process what the needs of his emotional nature are.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_17:0.0250:tricity without sacrificing some measure of distinction. Yet Miss
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_18:0.0000:Teasdale has done that. Hers is the most concentrated expres-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_19:0.0000:sion of personality in American lyricism. "The one unchanging
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_20:0.0250:thing is I," she wrote in one of her earlier poems, and she is of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_23:0.0000:tents that her introspection does not lower her quality, as with
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_24:0.0000:most poets, though it limits her creative scope. Her world is
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_25:0.0000:the evening sky with one lone star and she is that star. Star
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_26:0.0000:unto star uttereth speech and so she communes with herself.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_27:0.0000:But she does it with such intensity and distilled naturalness that
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_28:0.0000:for the moment the personal seems to have put on univer-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_29:0.0000:sality. She is not star-crossed, she is star-compelled; that is to
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_30:0.0000:say, it is herself that controls her course. Her rhythm has the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_31:0.0000:flow of finality. It is indeed herself that sings in her; it is "star-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_32:0.0500:song at night." It governs her imagery, which is sparse but
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0035_33:0.0000:beautiful.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_0:0.0250:"THERE IS BUT one thing certain," says Pliny, with his curi-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_1:0.0000:ous mixture of matter-of-fact and melancholy, "that nothing is
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_2:0.0000:certain ; and there is nothing more wretched or more proud than
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_3:0.0000:man." Human unhappiness and the pride that half causes it
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_4:0.0000:and half redeems of the union of these two eternal contrasts
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_5:0.0000:FLAME AND SHADOW is made. It is the utterance of a mood
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_6:0.0250:which all feel sometimes, some always; which all the genera-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_7:0.0000:tions have repeated, yet each of them yearns to hear expressed
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_8:0.0000:anew in the special accents of its own day that particular kind
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_9:0.0000:of pessimism which feels the vanity, and yet the value, of life.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_10:0.0000:And it needs to be restated still. For the present cannot live on
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_11:0.0000:the past, on dead men's words, alone; its own literature may
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_12:0.0000:be inferior, much of it must be, inevitably, minor; yet, as Homer
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_13:0.0000:had already learnt, men love the song which is new, and a
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_14:0.0000:living voice has in some ways an appeal that no dead eloquence
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_15:0.0000:can bring. This is the value of FLAME AND SHADOW ; not that
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_16:0.0000:it contains new ideas, but that a view of life which our age in
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_17:0.0000:part accepts, in part struggles to avoid, is here once more ex-
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_18:0.0000:pressed with sincerity and skill the feeling that for all the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_19:0.0000:agony of transience, all the disillusion of hopes in vain fulfilled,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_20:0.0000:there are no consolations, but the bitter beauty of the Universe,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0036_21:0.0500:and the frail human pride that confronts it, for a moment, un-

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_1:0.0000:As an Author of Original Poems, I beg most respectfully to
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_2:0.0000:address myself, to a judicious and discerning class of intellectual
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_3:0.0000:beings ; who have read, and thus know well the general and
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_4:0.0000:accustomed track wherein our much beloved and honoured Bards
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_5:0.0000:of ancient date for centuries have trod, and those of modern times,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_6:0.0250:base imitators of the same, no better style or matter can produce.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_7:0.0000:In consequence of which the noble mind of man feels satiate, and
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_8:0.0000:disgusted at the non-improvement of a science so delightful in
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_9:0.0000:itself, harmonious, and sublime ! — Full thirty years have I closely
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_10:0.0000:watched their rife, though retrospective movement ; and now, for
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_11:0.0000:reasons similar, though not in egotistic mood, methinks a new
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_12:0.0000:creation springs ; yet captious minds may say, no better than the
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_13:0.0000:rest; nor do I here presume they are, where narrow and con-
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_14:0.0000:tracted intellect presides, which cannot comprehend the height,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_15:0.0000:and depth, therein contained. — Poetic genius is a Datural gift, by
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_16:0.0000:heaven matured. The works of Pope and Milton are sublime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_17:0.0000:and bear the stamp of immortality ! which some would vainly
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_18:0.0250:Idolize, and never think or dare to go beyond. With deference
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_19:0.0000:due, I boldly state, in this they err, for who would place a limit
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_20:0.0000:to the soul's expansion and improvement ? Though these and
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_21:0.0000:'thers, quite as. noble in their sentiment may thus be termed
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_22:0.0000:'' good and standard works.'' Yet gross is the idea which many do
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_23:0.0000:imbibe, that where they stand, is quite the top of intellect, to
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_24:0.0250:which we never can attain; nor ever need to try. But hold a
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0011_25:0.0500:moment, not so fast ; just let us keep in time with reason, the
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_1:0.0500:product of their mind we have, together with our own capa-
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_2:0.0250:cious iutellectual powers, by which, while in the elastic car, we
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_3:0.0000:may improve, and on the wings of genius soar to regions of immor-
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_4:0.0000:tal truth, and light, and knowledge, far beyond our predecessors !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_5:0.0500:But where is our advance ? and where the period fixed at which
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_6:0.0250:we stop ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_7:0.0500:I here would answer, stop ! never, but, through time to one
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_8:0.0000:eternal day progress, towards him who granted this, " The
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_9:0.0000:Privilege of Man." Keep pace with time, in things sublime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_10:0.0000:and never let the past suffice. Mark the wide capacious vacuum
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_11:0.0000:between the highest dignity on earth, and God in heaven ! who
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_12:0.0000:only all perfection knows, to whom is nothing small, and nothing
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_13:0.0000:great. 'Tis he alone the standard of sublimity ! to whom we
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_14:0.0000:must aspire; and if we strive in faith, assistance shall be given.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_15:0.0000:This is the golden lever, and the fulcrum too, wherewith to raise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_16:0.0000:fhe intellectual mind above all mortal ken ! Thus, to assimulate
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_17:0.0000:our Maker and our God. Likewise through Christ, to fit
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_18:0.0000:and well prepare the vital spark to shiue with splendour and
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_19:0.0250:magnificence, progressive in the train of those, whose lovely beams
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_20:0.0500:eradiate the crystal vaults of heaven ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_21:0.0500:Mark, those who would drink the sweet pierion spring, must to
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_22:0.0000:the fountain go; the lovely streams from thence proceed, and
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_23:0.0000:thither must return, where knowledge, (without ignorance) shall
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_24:0.0000:reign supreme, with no decay of parts, for, wisdom in longevity
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_25:0.0000:remains ! Then, shall we stay the intellectual part beneath what
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_26:0.0000:is attainable to all who strive beyond the beaten track of human
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_27:0.0000:life to soar : or even what gigantic minds may have attained;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_28:0.0000:while seas of knowledge unexplored remain unsounded, traversed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_29:0.0000:and unseen ? Take this small hiot, then look within the volume you
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_30:0.0000:have in haud ; where with the keen and penetrative eye, you gaze
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_31:0.0000:on scenes you never saw ! Thus with astonishment behold what
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_32:0.0000:mortals wish to know, and catch by inspiration, truly taught the
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_33:0.0250:lesson none could buy, with gold or rubies bright, by faith in
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0012_34:0.0000:Christ, 'tis freely given ; " The Privilege of Man! ! !"

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_7:0.0000:Somersby, and, after a course of some length
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_8:0.0250:through different villages, it enters the sea at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_9:0.0000:a spot called Gibraltar Point, where it forms
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_10:0.0000:Wainfleet Haven. ' It is,' says a native of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_11:0.0000:district, ' the noisiest and most rippling I ever
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_12:0.0000:heard, and full of trout.' The house where the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_13:0.0000:poet was born has been considerably enlarged,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_14:0.0000:and the tiny church where his father ministered
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_15:0.0000:has been restored. But the curious will still see

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_18:0.0000:are Spilsby and Horncastle. Spilsby is famous
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_19:0.0000:as the residence of Sir John Franklin, after-

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_22:0.0250:Perhaps some readers may remember it as the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0019_23:0.0000:home of Bennet Langton, whom Samuel John-

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_16:0.0500:great connection. Eyre, afterwards so well
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_17:0.0000:known as Governor of Jamaica, went to the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_18:0.0250:grammar school a year or two after the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_19:0.0000:Tennysons had left, and found the boys very
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_20:0.0250:proud of school-fellows who had published a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0021_21:0.0500:volume of poems.

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0022_6:0.0250:are 102 poems, forming a volume of 228 pages

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0022_17:0.0250:of the authorship. As a whole, it does not
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0022_18:0.0250:give much indication of the talent that was to

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_8:0.0500:1833, and not published till 1879. It has a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_9:0.0250:singular interest from the light it throws on the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_10:0.0250:history of the author's mind. It shows that at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_13:0.0000:that in this poem the youthful author has been
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_14:0.0250:often seduced from his own more characteristic
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_15:0.0250:language by reminiscences of recent readings of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0027_16:0.0000:Shelley's works, particularly ' Epipsychidion.' 1

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0028_26:0.0500:enthusiasm to this first serious production of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0029_3:0.0250:said to resemble Robert Browning's first poem,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0029_4:0.0250:'Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession,' which is in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0029_5:0.0250:blank verse, of about similar length, written at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0029_6:0.0250:about the same age, and published, by a curious

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0029_18:0.0250:wise to reproduce the two parts already known,

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_17:0.0500:without any very good reason, that poetry was likely
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_18:0.0000:to perish among us for a considerable period after

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_22:0.0000:forth poetry by a young man, and that where we should
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_23:0.0000:least expect it, namely in a prize poem. These pro-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_24:0.0500:ductions have often been ingenious and elegant, but
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_25:0.0000:we have never before seen one of them which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0035_26:0.0500:indicated really first-rate poetical genius, and which

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0038_4:0.0500:whose memory he has immortalised in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0038_9:0.0250:of all who knew him. The facts of his life are
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0038_10:0.0500:derived from a memoir written by his father.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0038_11:0.0500:The son of Henry Hallam, so well known as a

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0038_16:0.0250:strict conscientiousness, became evident. In

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_8:0.0000:went to Eton, where he continued till 1827. He
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_9:0.0000:did not become a first-rate classical scholar, a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_10:0.0000:circumstance accounted for by the bent of his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_11:0.0000:mind to other subjects. The poets of Eng-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_12:0.0250:land, especially the older dramatists, drew his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_13:0.0000:mind away from ancient literature. Of Shake-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_14:0.0500:speare particularly he became a diligent and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_15:0.0250:enthusiastic student. Byron was for a time his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_16:0.0000:favourite among modern poets, but was ulti-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_17:0.0250:mately discarded for Wordsworth and Shelley.

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_22:0.0000:great power of argumentative discussion. On
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_23:0.0250:leaving Eton he passed eight months with his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_24:0.0000:parents in Italy, becoming familiar with the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0039_25:0.0250:language and the works of Dante and Petrarch.

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_9:0.0250:desultory nature of his acquirements forbade all
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_10:0.0250:hope of distinction in examinations, and he did
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_14:0.0250:father ; but he gradually became reconciled to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_15:0.0250:the evident bent of his son's mind. Arthur paid
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_16:0.0500:no attention whatever to Mathematical studies,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_17:0.0500:another circumstance which his father very
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_19:0.0250:was very treacherous in retaining facts which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_20:0.0500:did not interest him ; and besides, in the first
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_21:0.0500:year of his residence at Cambridge, symptoms
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_24:0.0250:made him often incapable of mental fatigue.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_25:0.0250:But his brilliant powers were soon recognised, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0040_26:0.0500:his College reputation was very high. In 1 83 1 he

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0049_10:0.0250:a few other pieces. Some of his poems were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0049_13:0.0250:for unveiling. As a whole, his poetry is not
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0049_14:0.0500:memorable, though graceful and touching. A

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0051_14:0.0000:Fairies,' along with a few other poems still
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_3:0.0500:monious individuality of expression, that strange
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_4:0.0000:power of saying commonplace things in a way
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_5:0.0500:peculiar to himself, of strengthening all he
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_6:0.0500:touches by adding a turn and stamp of his own,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_8:0.0000:art.' ' The supposed confessiorjs of a second-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_9:0.0250:rate sensitive mind not in unity with itself
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_11:0.0250:emotion. Arthur Hallam said that the title
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_12:0.0000:was incorrect, because the mood portrayed in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_13:0.0250:the poem was rather the clouded season of a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_14:0.0500:strong mind than the habitual condition of one
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_15:0.0250:feeble and second-rate. ' The poem,' says Leigh
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0052_16:0.0250:Hunt, ' is one which Crashaw might have written
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_3:0.0500:The Tatler, in which he compared with it the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_4:0.0500:small volume of sonnets issued at the same time
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_5:0.0000:by Charles Tennyson, and awarded the prize to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_6:0.0500:Alfred. The Westminster Review discussed
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_7:0.0250:the volume in a careful article, saying that the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_8:0.0500:poems demonstrated the possession of powers
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_9:0.0500:whose future direction was a matter of anxiety,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_10:0.0500:and counselled the poet to be true to his grand
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_17:0.0000:songs set themselves and generate their own
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_18:0.0250:tunes, as all songs do that are good for any-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0054_19:0.0000:thing.' The Atlas remarked 'We are ex-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_2:0.0000:Lyrical Poems of Alfred Tennyson.' The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_3:0.0250:article appeared in August 1831, and has been
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_4:0.0000:only partly reprinted in Hallam's Remains. It
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_5:0.0500:is- full of enthusiasm, but is critical withal.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_6:0.0250:Tennyson is pronounced a poet in the truest
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_7:0.0000:and highest sense : ' His ear has a fairy fineness ;
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_8:0.0250:there is a strange earnestness in his worship of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_9:0.0000:beauty, which throws a charm over his impas-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_10:0.0500:sioned song more easily felt than described, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_11:0.0000:not to be escaped by those who have once felt
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_12:0.0250:it. The author imitates nobody. We recognise
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_13:0.0250:the spirit of his age, but not the individual form
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_14:0.0000:of this or that writer.' Five distinctive excel-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_15:0.0000:lencies of Tennyson's manner are marked.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_16:0.0000:First, his luxuriance of imagination and his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_17:0.0000:control over it ; second, his power of embodying
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_18:0.0250:himself in ideal characters ; third, his vivid
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_19:0.0250:picturesque delineation of objects, and peculi-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_20:0.0500:arity with which he holds all of them fused in a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_21:0.0000:medium of strong emotion ; fourth, the variety
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_22:0.0250:of his lyrical measures and exquisite modulation
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0055_24:0.0500:habits of thought.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_6:0.0500:certainly it would be easy for a hostile critic to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_7:0.0500:make a very damaging case against the quon-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_8:0.0000:dam luminary of Edinburgh and Blackwood.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_10:0.0250:Wilson was possessed of great powers, and a

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_13:0.0250:his time, and only too congenial to one who
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_14:0.0000:was too much at home in the over-heated
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_15:0.0250:atmosphere of politics, have served to impair
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_16:0.0500:his reputation and reduce his authority. But
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_17:0.0000:those who read his review of Tennyson will
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_18:0.0000:probably think that in some respects the critic
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_19:0.0250:does his author justice. In the Noctes Ambro-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_20:0.0500:sianae for the preceding February, Wilson had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_21:0.0000:remarked ' He has a fine ear for melody, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_22:0.0000:harmony too, and rare and rich glimpses of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_23:0.0000:imagination ; he has genius. I admire Alfred,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_24:0.0250:and hope, nay trust, that one day he will prove
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_25:0.0500:himself a poet. If he do not, then I am no
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0056_26:0.0500:prophet.' The detailed criticism, when it ap-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_7:0.0250:But Wilson's genuine love of nature pre-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_8:0.0000:vented the excess of critical aberration of which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_9:0.0000:Lockhart, the other great Tory editor, was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_10:0.0250:guilty in treating the volume of 1832. In 1831
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_11:0.0250:Dr. Tennyson, the poet's father, died. He was,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_13:0.0000:able gifts, and is reputed in local tradition to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_14:0.0250:have been of a somewhat stern and saturnine
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_17:0.0250:for which room he carved a mantelpiece out of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_18:0.0000:the stone of the district. He was interred in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_19:0.0000:Somersby churchyard, where a plain grave-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_20:0.0250:stone with a half-worn inscription is still to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_21:0.0250:be read. No other of the family is buried
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0057_22:0.0500:there. Mrs. Tennyson retired to Hampstead,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0059_3:0.0250:in the winter of 1832. His volume appeared
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0059_4:0.0250:with the imprint of Mr. Edward Moxon, who
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0059_5:0.0250:continued for many years to act as the poet's
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0059_9:0.0250:Daughter/ ' Fatima,' ' Oenone,' ' The Palace of

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0059_12:0.0500:Old Year.' To ' Fatima/ the following motto
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_1:0.0250:two suspicious circumstances, indeed, might
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_2:0.0000:connect it with the notorious Croker, but his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_3:0.0000:articles are generally recognisable by their pro-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_4:0.0000:fusion of italics and capitals, and besides there
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_5:0.0250:are touches of satire too delicate for Croker.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_6:0.0000:Lockhart never better deserved his title ' Scor-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_7:0.0000:pion ' than when he wrote this article. The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_8:0.0250:criticism, although it unquestionably fastens
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_9:0.0000:upon some weak points, is nevertheless so
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_10:0.0250:monstrously unjust and inadequate as to induce
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_11:0.0000:a feeling of thankfulness that criticism is now
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_12:0.0250:so much more patient, careful, and serious.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_13:0.0250:The critic adopts a tone of ironical praise which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_14:0.0500:must have been in the highest degree distaste-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_15:0.0250:ful to his subject. A specimen or two may be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0060_16:0.0000:quoted as a warning to critics. Quoting the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_11:0.0000:of blame, but that praise is too much for them,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_12:0.0500:and illustrates his observation by the story of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_13:0.0000:the London Alderman who imbibed somewhat
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_14:0.0250:too deeply of claret, with the result that he had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_15:0.0500:to be carried home. He explained his discom-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_16:0.0500:fiture next morning, not to the claret, which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_17:0.0500:was sound and could do no one harm, but to a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_18:0.0250:single strawberry which he had kept all night
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0061_20:0.0000:he may have felt, said nothing, but with charac-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_2:0.0250:complained of their want of harmony, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_3:0.0000:recommended him to write for the next two or
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_4:0.0500:three years in well-known and strictly defined
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_5:0.0250:metres. John Sterling said ' Lately I have
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_6:0.0000:been reading some of Alfred Tennyson's second
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_7:0.0000:volume, and with profound admiration of his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_8:0.0000:truly lyric and idyllic genius.' Allan Cun-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_9:0.0250:ningham said ' He has lyrical ease and vigour,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_10:0.0250:and is looked upon by sundry critics as the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_11:0.0250:chief living hope of the Muse.' Finally, John
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_12:0.0000:Stuart Mill reviewed the poems in the West-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_13:0.0250:minster for July 1835, and with his usual
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_14:0.0000:earnestness and generosity, applied all his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_15:0.0000:powers to making a just estimate of the new
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_16:0.0000:aspirant. With all this, however, the sale seems
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0062_17:0.0250:to have been slow, and a second edition did

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_6:0.0500:Tennyson has always shown in his poetic gifts
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_7:0.0250:forbids us to suppose that the critics shut his lips,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_8:0.0250:but it may well be that he desired to perfect
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_9:0.0000:himself still further in his art before he again
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_10:0.0250:appeared before a public which had so little
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_12:0.0500:The silence was not altogether unbroken. In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_13:0.0500:1837 he published in the Keepsake the lovely
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_14:0.0000:poem ' St. Agnes,' and in the same year he
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_17:0.0250:the still more lovely lines commencing ' O that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0063_18:0.0500:'t were possible,' which have been reproduced in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_6:0.0000:the time in Caistor, Lincolnshire, where his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_7:0.0000:uncle was vicar, and to have written there his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_8:0.0250:poem, ' Death of the Old Year.' But his time
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_10:0.0500:says 'Avoiding general society, he would
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_11:0.0500:prefer to sit up all night with a friend, or else
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_14:0.0500:But though silent, he was not forgotten. His
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_15:0.0250:detractors did not forget to taunt him. We
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_16:0.0000:find the Quarterly Review in 1839, in a notice
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_17:0.0000:of Monckton Milnes' poems, says that he will
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_18:0.0500:regret few sins of his youth more bitterly than
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_19:0.0250:the homage he has now rendered at the fantastic
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_20:0.0250:shrines of such baby idols as Mr. John Keats
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_21:0.0000:and Mr. Alfred Tennyson. Not content with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0064_22:0.0250:this, the same journal returned to the charge in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_2:0.0250:in ' The Tribute' as the work of a true poet.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_3:0.0250:Many calls were made for a new edition of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_4:0.0250:volumes which were long out of print. As Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_5:0.0500:Spedding remarked in the Edinburgh Re-view,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_6:0.0500:one of the severest tests by which an author can
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_7:0.0250:try the truth of his book is to let it continue for
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_8:0.0000:two or three years out of print. If a new
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_9:0.0250:edition be perseveringly demanded, it may be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_10:0.0000:concluded that the work has in it something of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_11:0.0250:abiding interest and permanent value. In 1842
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_12:0.0000:there appeared ' Poems by Alfred Tennyson/ in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_13:0.0250:two volumes, which is substantially what we buy
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_14:0.0250:at the present day. It consists of three divisions
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_15:0.0000:first, a selection from the contents of the 1830
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_16:0.0250:volume ; second, a selection from the volume of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_20:0.0500:lyrics, ' You asked me Why,' ' Of old sat
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0065_21:0.0500:Freedom,' and ' Love thou thy Land ;' third,

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_9:0.0000:was first printed in the edition of 1873, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_10:0.0500:addressed to Edward Lear, a landscape painter,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_11:0.0000:on his book entitled 'Journals of Tours in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_12:0.0500:Central and Southern Italy and Albania.' Lear
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_13:0.0500:is the author of ' The Book of Nonsense,' and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_19:0.0000:enthusiastic. The poet reaped the rich reward
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_20:0.0000:of his long discipline. Critics of all kinds lifted
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_21:0.0000:their voices in praise, and some suffrages must
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_22:0.0000:have been peculiarly valued. Foremost was the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_23:0.0500:venerable Wordsworth, who had an interview
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_24:0.0250:with Tennyson in his publisher's house in I843. 1
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0066_25:0.0500:In 1845 Wordsworth writes to Professor Reed

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0067_25:0.0000:of the new race of poets.' ' Yes,' he replied ;

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_10:0.0000:declared that it might be centuries before such
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_11:0.0500:a thinker and speaker as Tennyson appeared.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_12:0.0500:Edgar Allan Poe avowed that admiration in

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_22:0.0250:with all poets, living or dead, he has neglected
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_23:0.0000:to make precise investigation of the principles
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0068_24:0.0000:of metre. But, on the other hand, so perfect is

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0069_6:0.0500:among the richest of our recent literature.'

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0069_16:0.0500:Spedding could not refrain from prophesying

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0069_22:0.0000:whole series added together. This was too
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0069_23:0.0250:much for the cautious editor.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_4:0.0500:the field. In 1845 Alfred Tennyson received a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_5:0.0250:pension of ^200 through Sir Robert Peel. The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_6:0.0000:pension, it is said, was granted not for literary
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_7:0.0000:merit, but as a compensation for some claim the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_8:0.0250:Tennyson family had on the Crown. However
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_10:0.0000:1845, published the 'New Timon,' attacked
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_11:0.0000:Tennyson in the most contemptuous terms,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_12:0.0500:speaking of his poetry as a jingling medley of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_13:0.0000:purloined conceits, and of himself as being
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_14:0.0250:quartered on the public purse in the prime of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_15:0.0000:life, without either wife or family. He probably
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_16:0.0250:soon repented his rash assault, for a month or
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_17:0.0000:two after ' Miss Alfred,' as he had styled
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_18:0.0500:Tennyson, retorted in Punch in some of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0071_19:0.0250:most bitter and trenchant lines ever written.

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0073_8:0.0500:is very possible you may come across him in a

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_10:0.0250:snatches, having no connection, and therefore
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_11:0.0500:deriving no light or further interest the one
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_12:0.0000:from the other. In obedience, perhaps, to this
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_13:0.0000:demand, he published, in 1847, 'The Princess, a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_14:0.0000:Medley.' The idea of ' The Princess ' seems to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_18:0.0000:first to learn of sciences, and then proposed to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_19:0.0250:found a college to teach women, in which she
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_20:0.0000:would preside.' As the poem now stands, about
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_21:0.0250:170 lines have been added to the blank-verse of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_23:0.0500:chiefly by the weaving into the plot of the piece
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_24:0.0250:the after-thought of the Princess's cataleptic seiz-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_25:0.0000:ures. The lyrics which divide the sections were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0074_26:0.0250:added at the same time. Very few lines are sup-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_7:0.0500:liant, it was thought scarcely worthy of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_8:0.0250:author. The abundant grace, descriptive beauty,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_10:0.0000:medley was thought somewhat incongruous,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_12:0.0500:sustain the embroidery raised upon it. D.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_13:0.0250:M. Moir, the amiable ' Delta ' of Blackwood's
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_14:0.0250:Magazine, says ' Its beauties and faults are so
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_15:0.0250:inextricably interwoven, and the latter are so
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_16:0.0000:glaring and many, nay, often apparently so
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_17:0.0000:wilful, that as a sincere admirer of the genius
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_18:0.0500:of Tennyson I could almost wish the poem
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_19:0.0000:had remained unwritten. I admit the excel-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_20:0.0250:lencies of particular passages, but it has neither
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_21:0.0000:general harmony of design nor sustained merit
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_22:0.0000:of execution.' A verdict more favourable, but
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_23:0.0000:somewhat in the same strain, may be said to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0075_24:0.0250:be that now generally accepted.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_6:0.0000:was the most suggestive. Tennyson's works
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_7:0.0250:were so familiar to Lushington that, if they had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_14:0.0000:lake Church, Oxfordshire, to Emily, daughter of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_15:0.0500:Henry Sellwood, Esq. Mr. Sellwood came from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_16:0.0000:Berkford to Horncastle, where he married, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_17:0.0000:practised many years as a solicitor. His wife
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_18:0.0000:was the sister of Sir John Franklin, who lived
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_19:0.0000:at Spilsby, about ten miles from Horncastle.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_20:0.0500:Mr. Sellwood had three daughters. Alfred
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_21:0.0000:Tennyson married the eldest ; Mr. C. R. Weld,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_22:0.0250:geographer at Somerset House, and author of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_23:0.0000:many works of travel, married the second ; and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_24:0.0500:Charles Tennyson Turner the third. It is per-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_25:0.0500:haps permissible to say that Mrs. Tennyson is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0076_26:0.0000:the ' dear, near, and true' of the beautiful dedica-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_5:0.0250:the Rev. Drummond Rawnsley, who was con-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_6:0.0000:nected by marriage with Sir John Franklin. It
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_7:0.0250:was witnessed by Cecilia Lushington, the poet's
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_8:0.0000:sister ; Edmund Law Lushington, her husband,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_13:0.0500:' Once, I remember, Miss Mitford carried me on
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_15:0.0250:a tower half-covered with ivy. We came to it
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_16:0.0250:through laurel hedges, and passed on the way a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_17:0.0000:magnificent cedar of Lebanon. It was a superb
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_18:0.0500:pile ; rich in painted glass windows and carved
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0077_20:0.0250:man to stop, and turning to me with great
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_1:0.0500:England, stopped at Paris, and in the Louvre

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_5:0.0500:offered each other their houses, he having a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_6:0.0500:cottage at Twickenham, and they not having
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_7:0.0250:given up their apartments at Casa Guidi. Of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_8:0.0250:this marriage there was issue two sons, Hallam
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_9:0.0250:and Lionel, both of whom have contributed to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_10:0.0000:the Nineteenth Century. Miss Mitford, writing
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_11:0.0500:in 1853, says: 'Alfred Tennyson was with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_12:0.0250:Charles Kingsley lately, much softened and im-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_13:0.0250:proved by ' the birth of his child. They are
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_14:0.0250:looking for a house near her friends, but would
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_15:0.0000:come here, Mr. Kingsley thinks, if we could
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_16:0.0000:find him a habitation. I should like that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_17:0.0500:much.' They took up their abode ultimately
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_19:0.0500:the Laureate's home for many years, and is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_20:0.0250:inseparably identified with his genius. Some
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0078_25:0.0500:appeared very soon after Wordsworth's death,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_1:0.0500:it was received prepared the public for Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_2:0.0500:Tennyson's nomination. But the suffrages were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_3:0.0250:by no means unanimous. Leigh Hunt claimed
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_5:0.0500:Athenceum urged the title of Elizabeth Barrett
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_6:0.0250:Browning, saying that it would be a peculiarly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_7:0.0000:graceful action to appoint a woman of such
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_8:0.0000:genius laureate to Queen Victoria, and besides
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_9:0.0000:that the action would reward two poets at once.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_10:0.0500:When after some months Mr. Tennyson was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_11:0.0000:appointed, the same journal complained of Lord
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_12:0.0250:John Russell's use of his patronage, and while
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_14:0.0000:said that it had been sufficiently recognised
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_15:0.0500:already by the gift of a pension. It is said that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_16:0.0000:the laurel was first offered by Prince Albert to

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_18:0.0000:now almost forgotten, and of whom the most
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_19:0.0500:notable fact is perhaps that he contrived to pay
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_20:0.0000:a call on Samuel Johnson, and lived to pro-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_21:0.0250:phesy the future greatness of Algernon Swin-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_22:0.0250:burne. He was then eighty-seven years of age,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_23:0.0250:and felt that his years and wealth should pre-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_24:0.0000:vent him from interfering with the claims of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_25:0.0000:younger and poorer men. Mr. Tennyson was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0079_26:0.0500:presented at the Queen's levee at Buckingham

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0080_9:0.0000:cannot at this moment be said to possess one,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0080_11:0.0500:It is a curious matter of speculation who

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_6:0.0500:American epigram, for Friendship what Petrarch
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_7:0.0250:did for Love. Indeed, it is obvious that the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_8:0.0000:scheme of the work is suggested by the series
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_9:0.0250:of poems dedicated by Petrarch to the memory
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_10:0.0250:of ' Laura.' The versification of ' In Memo-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_11:0.0000:riam ' is usually said to be borrowed from Ben
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_12:0.0000:Jonson ; but there has been pointed out by Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_13:0.0250:Comyns Carr that the rough and jolting verses
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_14:0.0000:of Jonson are too deficient in rhyme and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_15:0.0250:cadence to suggest the matchless melody of ' In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_16:0.0000:Memoriam.' He is undoubtedly right in tracing
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0081_17:0.0500:the metre of the verses to Lord Herbert of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0082_0:0.0500:68 ALFRED TENNYSON.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_7:0.0250:The first twenty-one pieces are occupied with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_8:0.0000:the period intervening between Arthur's death
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_9:0.0250:and burial. Several beautiful pieces are sug-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_10:0.0250:gested by the voyage of the ship that bears his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_11:0.0250:remains to England. The ship arrives, the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_12:0.0000:grave is dug, and, meditating by the grave, the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_13:0.0000:poet bethinks himself of the cross of their
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_14:0.0000:friendship. Through four sweet years they had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_15:0.0250:walked with each other ; in the autumn of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_16:0.0000:fifth year the shadow feared of man broke the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_17:0.0250:fair companionship. Piece after piece is now
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0083_18:0.0250:filled with the melodious reflections of the poet
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_1:0.0500:course of Christ with the family at Bethany, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_2:0.0000:the other rebuking the cynical scepticism of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_3:0.0250:jigfe. The poem continues deeply religious, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_4:0.0000:profound questions are started and partially or
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_5:0.0500:tentatively answered. Number 72 commemo-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_6:0.0500:rates the first return of the day that Arthur
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_7:0.0250:died ; and in the interval between the first
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_8:0.0250:anniversary of his loss and the second Christ-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_9:0.0000:mas, he reflects on the transitory nature of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_10:0.0250:human affairs. The second Christmas comes,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_11:0.0250:and over all things is the quiet sense of some-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_13:0.0000:Year is greeted with hope. The second
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_14:0.0250:anniversary of the death is not so gloomy as
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_15:0.0000:the first. Before the third Christmas the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_18:0.0250:several beautiful lyrics. The third Christmas,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_19:0.0500:then, is passed in a new land, and grief is not
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0084_20:0.0500:oppressive, so he bursts out in those jubilant
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_15:0.0500:emotion.' The facts of literature are a suffi-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_16:0.0000:cient reply. The verses Lord Macaulay wrote
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_17:0.0000:after his defeat at Edinburgh have, says Lord
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_18:0.0000:Houghton, a high gnomic tone, and add to the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_19:0.0250:instances of the human inclination to look to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_20:0.0000:verse as the appropriate expression of emotion
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_21:0.0000:in the crises of life, which shows itself not only
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0085_22:0.0000:in such cultivated minds as those of Macaulay
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_4:0.0500:of Lord Nelson, whose doggerel to Emma from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_5:0.0000:Copenhagen, dated ' Nine o'clock at night, very
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_6:0.0250:tired after a hard-fought battle,' is a wonderful
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_7:0.0500:private note in the great page of history. Some

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_10:0.0500:dying, which are to be found in his strange life
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_12:0.0000:The poem was received with reverence and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_13:0.0000:admiration as a permanent addition to the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_14:0.0250:wealth of English literature. Sara Coleridge
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_15:0.0500:writes to Aubrey de Vere, under date August 6,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_17:0.0500:of " In Memoriam" ; many thanks. What a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_18:0.0500:treasure it will be if I can ever think of it and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_19:0.0000:feel about it as you do and as Mr. T. does ! You
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_20:0.0000:said, " the finest strain since Shakespeare," and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_21:0.0000:afterwards that you and Mr. T. agreed that it
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_22:0.0000:set the Author above all modern poets, save only
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_23:0.0000:W. W[ordsworth] and S. T. C[oleridge]. My
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_24:0.0000:impression of the pieces you recited was that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0086_25:0.0000:they expressed great intensity of feeling ; but all
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_5:0.0000:riam" is a highly interesting volume, and worthy
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_6:0.0000:to be compared with the poems of Petrarch. I
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_7:0.0000:think it like his poems both in the general
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_8:0.0250:scheme and the execution of particular pieces.'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_15:0.0250:we find the name of Hallam Tennyson, son of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_16:0.0000:the Laureate, who at that time (1852) resided at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_17:0.0000:Twickenham, where he had written 'In Memo-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_18:0.0250:riam,' ' a fact,' says the Spectator} ' which will
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_19:0.0000:make the place more worthy of a pilgrimage in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0087_20:0.0000:future days than all the memories it can boast
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_0:0.0000:CHAPTER VIII.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_6:0.0500:the inanity and servility of previous occupants
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_7:0.0250:had made far from enviable. When he writes
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_8:0.0000:patriotic songs, he assumes, it has been truly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_9:0.0000:said, quite a different individuality. His rhythm
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_11:0.0500:is changed. In March 1851, the seventh edition
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_12:0.0500:of his poems appeared, prefaced with an address
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0088_13:0.0250:to the Queen, one stanza of which is now
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0089_7:0.0500:'Third of February 1852;' and 'Hands all

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_17:0.0500:' Having heard that the brave soldiers at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_18:0.0000:Sebastopol, whom I am proud to call my
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_19:0.0000:countrymen, have a liking for my ballad on the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_20:0.0250:charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, I have
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_21:0.0250:ordered a thousand copies of it to be printed for
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_22:0.0000:them. No writing of mine can add to the glory
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_23:0.0250:they have acquired in the Crimea ; but if what
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0092_24:0.0500:I heard be true, they will not be displeased to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_11:0.0250:known under the title of ' Riflemen, Form,'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_12:0.0500:bearing the signature of ' T.' They were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_13:0.0250:absurdly attributed by some to Mr. Tupper,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_15:0.0000:not openly acknowledged by him. His interest
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_16:0.0000:in the Volunteer movement is shown by his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0093_17:0.0000:letter to Colonel Richards, who claimed to be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0094_7:0.0250:by command of Her Majesty, expressing ' the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0094_8:0.0250:pleasure and consolation which the Queen has
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0094_9:0.0000:derived from the dedication to the late Prince
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0094_10:0.0250:Consort which he has prefixed to the new
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0094_11:0.0250:edition of the " Idylls of the King." '

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_4:0.0000:capacity is the beautiful dedication to the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_5:0.0250:memory of the Princess Alice, in the Nineteenth
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_7:0.0000:thoroughly English in his sentiments, and more
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_8:0.0250:than a little bellicose. He has, however, refused
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_9:0.0250:to identify himself with any political party. In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_10:0.0250:1880 the Conservative students in Glasgow
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_12:0.0250:to become a candidate for the Lord Rector-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_14:0.0500:the nominee of a political party, he withdrew,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_15:0.0250:though willing to come forward trusting to his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_16:0.0250:literary claims. It is perhaps not to be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_18:0.0250:Eyre Defence Fund along with Carlyle, Ruskin,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_19:0.0250:and Kingsley. He wrote to the Secretary as
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_20:0.0000:follows : ' I send my small subscription as a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_21:0.0000:tribute to the nobleness of the man, and as a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_22:0.0000:protest against the spirit in which a servant of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_23:0.0250:the State, who has saved to us one of the islands
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_24:0.0250:of the Empire and many English lives, seems
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_25:0.0000:to be hunted down. In the meantime the out-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0095_26:0.0250:break of our Indian mutiny remains as a warn-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0096_4:0.0250:from one of Mr. Gladstone's most brilliant
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0096_7:0.0500:noble friend,' said Mr. Gladstone, ' in his speech
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0096_8:0.0500:delivered to-night tempts me to ground upon
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_0:0.0250:CHAPTER IX.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_6:0.0500:before. But how far the scheme of the poem
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_7:0.0250:had been matured at that time is unknown.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_8:0.0500:However this may be, the poem, when it
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_9:0.0250:appeared, was received with an almost una-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_11:0.0000:thing, it was dreamy and obscure, and most
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0097_12:0.0000:readers found it difficult to frame a coherent
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_2:0.0250:cure for moraFevils, and especially the cure for
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_3:0.0250:the evil of Mammon-worship. Besides, it was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_4:0.0500:declared that Mr. Tennyson's muse was not
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_5:0.0000:fitted for the poetry of war. The poet was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_6:0.0250:pronounced careless, visionary, and unreal ; his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_7:0.0000:intellect, pathos, and melody were said to have
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_8:0.0250:almost vanished, leaving little more than a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_9:0.0500:narrow scorn, piquing itself on its scorn of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_10:0.0250:narrowness, and a passion which clothed itself
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_11:0.0500:in exaggerated conceits. This judgment was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_12:0.0500:practically unanimous, and was shared in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_13:0.0000:especially by Mr. William C. Roscoe, whose
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_14:0.0000:criticism of the poet is amongst the best which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_15:0.0250:have appeared. The Times headed the chorus
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_16:0.0250:of disparaging voices in a coarse and spite-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_17:0.0250:ful article. Vindicators, however, were not
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_18:0.0500:entirely wanting. Mr. Sydney Dobell warmly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_19:0.0500:declared the poem to be the author's best, a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_22:0.0000:critical weight. Dobell was too partial to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_24:0.0500:too many things at the hands of critics for his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0098_25:0.0250:own poem ' Balder,' to be acquiescent with them
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_2:0.0000:phlet entitled ' Tennyson's " Maud " vindicated
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_4:0.0250:Sons)/ which Mr. Tennyson declared to be a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_5:0.0250:full explanation of his intent. ' No one/ said
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_6:0.0000:the poet, 'with this essay before him can in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_7:0.0250:future pretend to misunderstand my dramatic
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_8:0.0500:poem " Maud. " Your commentary is as true as
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_9:0.0000:it is full/ Dr. Mann's pamphlet is a calm and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_10:0.0000:clear exposition, chiefly noteworthy as insisting
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_11:0.0000:on the dramatic nature of the poem, which must
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_12:0.0000:not be taken as expressing the poet's own mind,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_13:0.0250:and repudiating energetically any personal
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_14:0.0000:reference to Mr. John Bright. Dr Mann calls
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_15:0.0000:the poem a monodrama, and Tennyson in the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_16:0.0000:latest editions has added this to the title. The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_17:0.0500:poem was greatly changed in following issues :
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_18:0.0000:it has been divided into two, and subsequently
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_19:0.0250:three parts. The effect of the changes has
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_20:0.0000:been greatly to improve it. Tennyson has
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_21:0.0250:listened to reasonable criticism, and amended
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_22:0.0500:his work. Mr. Bayne sums up the changes as
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_23:0.0000:follows : First, the poem is announced as a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_24:0.0250:monodrama. We are thus taught to expect
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0099_25:0.0500:that the hero will speak throughout for himself.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_1:0.0250:in real life, still the artist has a right within
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_2:0.0500:certain limits to adopt his own machinery.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_4:0.0000:parts, and thus the bewilderment felt in listen-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_5:0.0250:ing to a speaker sane at one moment, and mad
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_9:0.0000:as one hundred lines are deftly added here and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_10:0.0000:there, so that the direction of the road can be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0100_11:0.0250:perceived with entire distinctness. Further

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0105_15:0.0250:following passage 'We have had many cloudy

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0105_23:0.0000:hardly think Tennyson has done well, as a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0105_24:0.0500:poet, in fiy'ng his house in such exceptional
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_1:0.0500:country people are much amazed at his bad

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_3:0.0500:that he writes his poetry while mowing his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_4:0.0250:lawn. However, they hold him in great re-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_5:0.0250:spect, from a perception of the honour in which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_6:0.0500:he is held by their "betters." Our housewife
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_8:0.0250:tained us with an account of how said servant
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_9:0.0250:had lately been awed. Opening to a ring at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_10:0.0000:the door, when the Tennysons were out, she saw
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_11:0.0000:a "tall, handsome gentleman" standing there,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0106_12:0.0250:who, on learning they were not at home, turned

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_8:0.0500:English poets, Alfred Tennyson, not only
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_9:0.0000:through his works, but from the talk of mutual
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_10:0.0250:friends, that I gladly embraced an opportunity
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_11:0.0500:to know him personally, which happened to me
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_12:0.0500:in June, 1857. He was then living at his home,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_13:0.0000:the estate of Farringford, near Freshwater, in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_14:0.0000:the Isle of Wight. I should have hesitated to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_15:0.0000:intrude upon his retirement, had I not been
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_16:0.0250:kindly assured beforehand that my visit would
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_17:0.0250:not be unwelcome. The drive across the heart
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_18:0.0500:of the island from Newport to Freshwater was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_19:0.0000:alone worth the journey from London. The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0107_20:0.0250:softly undulating hills, the deep green valleys,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_1:0.0250:mansion, with a small thick-grassed park before
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_2:0.0000:it, a grove behind, and beyond all, the deep
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_3:0.0000:shoulder of the chalk downs, a gap in which, at
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_4:0.0000:Freshwater, showed the dark blue horizon of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_5:0.0000:the Channel. Leaving my luggage at one of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_6:0.0000:the two little inns, I walked to the house with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_7:0.0500:lines from " Maud " chiming in my mind. " The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_8:0.0500:dry-tongued laurel " shone glossily in the sun,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_9:0.0250:the cedar " sighed for Lebanon " on the lawn,

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_15:0.0000:almost in doubt as to his identity. The en-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_16:0.0500:graved head suggests a moderate stature, but
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0108_21:0.0500:mellow chest-voice never could have come

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_2:0.0250:or four miles distant from his residence. During
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_3:0.0250:the conversation with which we beguiled the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_4:0.0000:way, I was struck with the variety of his know-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_5:0.0250:ledge. Not a little flower on the downs, which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_6:0.0250:the sheep had spared, escaped his notice, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_7:0.0000:the geology of the coast, both terrestrial and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_8:0.0250:submarine, were perfectly familiar to him. I
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_9:0.0250:thought of a remark which I once heard from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_10:0.0000:the lips of a distinguished English author, 1 that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_16:0.0500:from which I parted the next afternoon with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_18:0.0500:not only fortunate and happy in his family
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_19:0.0500:relations, but that, with his large and liberal
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_20:0.0000:nature, his sympathies for what is true and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0109_21:0.0500:noble in humanity, and his depth and tender-

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_6:0.0250:to many a fit theme for an epic poem. Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_7:0.0000:Tennyson has wisely chosen to construct not an
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_8:0.0000:epic, but a series of idylls. When little more
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_9:0.0000:than a boy he first chanced upon a copy of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_10:0.0000:Malory's 'King Arthur:' the story kindled his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_11:0.0000:enthusiasm, and the vision of a great poem rose
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_13:0.0500:to be still extant, and to show the tenacity of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_14:0.0250:his purpose. So early as 1832 he published the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_15:0.0000:first version of ' The Lady of Shalott,' a story
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_16:0.0000:aftenvards treated in ' Elaine.' In 1842 there
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_17:0.0000:appeared the ' Morte d' Arthur,' professing to be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0110_18:0.0250:one rescued book out of a destroyed epic, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0111_3:0.0500:' Idylls of the King.' These idylls had been
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0111_4:0.0500:privately circulated before, and were read with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0111_5:0.0250:great delight by Macaulay and Clough. In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0111_6:0.0000:1870 'The Holy Grail and other Poems' was

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_6:0.0000:they saw by day, and all were alighted of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_7:0.0250:grace of the Holy Ghost ; and as each knight
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_8:0.0000:looked on his fellows, behold all was fairer than
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_9:0.0000:any on whom their eyes had ever rested yet.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_10:0.0250:But all sat dumb, and in the still silence came
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_11:0.0250:the Holy Grail, covered with white samite, that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_12:0.0000:none might see it, or the hand which bare it ;
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_13:0.0000:and with it came all sweet odours, and each
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_14:0.0000:knight had such food and drink as he loved best
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_15:0.0250:in the world ; and then the holy vessel was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_16:0.0250:borne away, they knew not whither. Then were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_17:0.0000:their tongues loosed, and the king gave thanks
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_18:0.0000:for that which they had seen. But Sir Gawaine
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_19:0.0000:said, " We have had this day all that our hearts
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_20:0.0000:would wish, but we might not see the Holy
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_21:0.0250:Grail, so needfully was it covered ; and, therefore,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_22:0.0000:now I vow with the morrow's morn to depart
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_23:0.0250:hence in quest of the holy vessel, and never to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_24:0.0000:return until I have seen it more openly ; and if I
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_25:0.0000:may not achieve this, I shall come back as one
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0116_26:0.0500:that may not win against the will of God." '
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_1:0.0500:It is necessary, besides, to understand the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_2:0.0250:allegorical meaning which has been authorita-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_3:0.0000:tively declared to belong to the poems. Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_4:0.0000:Tennyson has aimed at exhibiting the spiritual
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_5:0.0000:secret of the_djyine. and ^militant kingliness,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_6:0.0000:which alone makes man free, and the story of its
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_7:0.0000:gradual rejection by the world of sense and pas-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_8:0.0000:sion. In our exposition we follow mainly the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_9:0.0250:commentary of Dean Alford on the edition of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_10:0.0500:the 'Idylls' published in i860,. 1 The King
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_11:0.0000:^figures forth the highest soul of man in its
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_12:0.0000:purity, justice, nobleness, and self-denial. In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_13:0.0250:his coming, his foundation of the Round Table,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_14:0.0000:his struggles, disappointments, and departure we
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_15:0.0500:see the conflict continually maintained between
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_16:0.0000:the spirit and the flesh. In the issue we recog-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_18:0.0000:by the lust of the flesh. ' The Coming of Arthur'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_19:0.0500:describes the state of the land before he came,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_20:0.0250:the divine influence of the King over the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_21:0.0250:knights, their earnest sadness of swearing fealty
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_22:0.0000:to him, their receiving a momentary likeness
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0117_23:0.0000:of him, the three heavenly colours coming from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_0:0.0250:IO4 ALFRED TENNYSON.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_3:0.0500:King supported by the three great Christian
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_5:0.0250:justice, setting forth on his great career,,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_6:0.0500:inspiring and making like to himself by
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_11:0.0000:and firm, but disturbing forces soon break in,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_12:0.0000:and the succeeding Idylls describe these forces
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_13:0.0250:in their conflict with the higher soul. The pure
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_14:0.0250:mind, the high resolve are broken in upon by
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_15:0.0250:the body and its passions. For example, in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_16:0.0250:' Geraint' and ' Enid' we have the setting forth
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_17:0.0500:of the disturbance of pure and holy trust by a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_18:0.0250:storm of passionate suspicion. In ' Vivien' we
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_19:0.0000:see the vast wit and hundred wonders of Merlin
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_20:0.0250:taken captive and buried by the wiles of earthly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_21:0.0250:passion. In ' Elaine' the great crime comes to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_22:0.0250:light and bears bitter fruit. This poem shows
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_23:0.0000:us the apples of Sodom, which are the fruit of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_24:0.0000:unholy lust overbearing the higher soul. ' The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_25:0.0000:Holy Grail' points to the time when pure resolve
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0118_26:0.0000:and practical following of Him who is Lord of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_2:0.0000:disease of superstition. Putting on the very
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_3:0.0000:semblance of the holiest ends, and appealing to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_4:0.0000:parodied and exaggerated motives, dreams be-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_5:0.0250:come substitutes for a higher and better life.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_6:0.0500:' Pelleas and Ettarre' show the very height of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_7:0.0000:the corruption of the soul. All the purity and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_8:0.0250:high honour of the soul are stained. ' Guinevere'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_10:0.0500:shattered and spent. ' The Passing of Arthur'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_11:0.0500:shows the highest soul of man sinking in the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_12:0.0000:mist of death, but at evening time there is light,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_13:0.0500:and the end is glory. We may mention that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_14:0.0250:while of the ' Idylls of the King/ published
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_16:0.0000:in six weeks, of 'The Holy Grail and other
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_18:0.0500:than forty thousand copies were ordered in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_20:0.0250:noted.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_22:0.0250:turn by turn. In ' The Coming of Arthur' we
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_23:0.0250:have the marriage season of spring ; the early
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0119_24:0.0500:summer of the honeysuckle in ' Gareth ;' the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_3:0.0500:and broken weather of ' The Holy Grail.' Then
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_4:0.0000:the autumn roses of ' Pelleas ;' and the close of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_6:0.0500:' Guinevere ' the mists of coming winter ; in
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_14:0.0500:and the matter which it conveys. It rises and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_15:0.0000:falls very naturally with the nature of the sub-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_16:0.0500:ject. The first and last idylls have a distinctly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_18:0.0000:than the body of the work, because they dive
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_19:0.0000:into the more striking awfulnesses of birth
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_20:0.0000:and death, while in the poems of the Round
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0120_21:0.0250:Table we move in and out among the things
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_0:0.0250:CHAPTER XI.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_6:0.0500:by him was like the announcement of a new
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_7:0.0500:story by the author of ' Waverley ' forty years
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_9:0.0500:their own intellectual pleasures were being en-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_10:0.0500:larged, but that a legacy was being bequeathed
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_13:0.0250:well suited the genius of Crabbe, and might
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_14:0.0500:have supplied him with another tale of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_15:0.0000:Borough. But Mr. Tennyson was able not only
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_17:0.0250:reveal inward and spiritual difference, and his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0122_18:0.0500:genius was equally competent to describe the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_5:0.0500:Arden,' and in the story which followed it of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_9:0.0250:Northern Farmer' written in the Lincolnshire
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_11:0.0500:humour, but also as being one of the most
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_14:0.0250:Yorkshire farmer, and not one of Lincoln, that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_23:0.0500:Poet Laureate. The Queen has tendered the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0123_24:0.0250:choice honour to the great poet an offering
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_0:0.0500:HO ALFRED TENNYSON..
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_1:0.0250:her Majesty's gift in the spirit in which it was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_2:0.0500:offered to his acceptance. Sir Alfred is the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_3:0.0000:first Laureate who has been actually created a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_4:0.0500:baronet, for the same mark of royal favour
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_5:0.0250:made to Southey through Sir Robert Peel was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_6:0.0500:declined on other grounds than those of merit
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_7:0.0500:or ambition. But the list of literary baronets
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_8:0.0250:is growing strong, Lytton, Lyell, and Tennyson
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_10:0.0500:In spite of this emphatic announcement, Mr.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_12:0.0000:Athenceum affirmed that its information was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_20:0.0000:new pieces. In 1867, Sir Ivor Bertie Guest
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_21:0.0000:published, at his private printing press, a series
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_23:0.0250:the Song of the Wrens.' These were not given
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_24:0.0000:to the public until the end of 1870, when they
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0124_25:0.0500:appeared considerably altered, with music by
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_0:0.0250:CHAPTER XII.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_1:0.0000:MR. TENNYSON AS A DRAMATIST.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_6:0.0000:works have been variously and on the whole
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_7:0.0000:severely criticised. When ' Queen Mary' was
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_8:0.0250:published, it was felt that Mr. Tennyson had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_9:0.0500:made a perilous adventure in seeking strange
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_10:0.0250:laurels so late in life. It was felt also that he
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_11:0.0250:was tempting a difficult comparison between
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_12:0.0500:himself and Mr. Swinburne ; and, besides, many
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_13:0.0500:good judges thought that the life and death of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_14:0.0250:Mary Tudor did not contain the stuff of a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_15:0.0250:tragedy at all. Mr. Matthew Arnold had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_16:0.0250:already declared that the situations from which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0126_17:0.0250:no poetical enjoyment could be derived were
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_1:0.0500:action in which a continual strain of mental
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_2:0.0250:distress is unrelieved by incident, hope, or
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_3:0.0000:resistance in which there is everything to be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_4:0.0250:endured, nothing to be done. In such situations
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_11:0.0250:dramatic passion and incident into the story of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_12:0.0000:the Queen ; but it was admitted by the best
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_13:0.0500:judges that in parts the drama was admirably
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_19:0.0500:strict sense of the phrase, a real drama in its
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_20:0.0500:continuity of motion and its conduct of a series
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_21:0.0500:of events to one decisive issue. The character
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_22:0.0250:drawing, according to Mr. Symonds, is, from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_23:0.0500:want of an opportunity, less delicate and subtle
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_24:0.0000:than that in ' Queen Mary.' According to the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_25:0.0000:same critic, the dramatic genius of the poet is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0127_26:0.0000:best shown in tracing the primitive truth-loving
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_3:0.0000:it. The blank verse, with all its clear vigour,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_4:0.0250:was thought to lack the variety, rapidity, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_5:0.0500:spontaneity found in the best dramatic writers;
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_6:0.0250:These dramas were on the whole coldly received
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_7:0.0000:by the public, and when acted on the stage had
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_8:0.0250:but a partial success. Yet the poet is said to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_9:0.0250:value them more highly than any of his
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_10:0.0250:works, and so good a judge as Walt Whitman
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_18:0.0250:dedicated his Harold to my father's brother ;
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_19:0.0250:allow me to dedicate my Harold to yourself.'
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_20:0.0500:Bulwer Lytton in the preface to a new and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_21:0.0000:magnificent edition of King Arthur, had re-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_22:0.0000:marked, 'in deference to the fame of an
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_23:0.0000:illustrious contemporary,' that he had never
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_24:0.0500:anticipated that Mr. Tennyson would take up
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_25:0.0250:the same subject as himself; and that since it
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0128_26:0.0500:has turned out otherwise, he is thankful that

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_2:0.0250:MR. TENNYSON AT HOME.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_6:0.0250:residence in Surrey a description of which is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_7:0.0000:given in the following article which we reprint
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_8:0.0000:by permission from The World. It forms one
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_9:0.0000:of the admirable series which has been so great
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_10:0.0000:an attraction in that paper. We may mention
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_11:0.0000:that the architect of this house was Mr. J. T.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_12:0.0000:Knowles, who is understood to be a close friend
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_13:0.0000:of Mr. Tennyson's. Mr. Knowles is well known
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_14:0.0000:as editor of the Nineteenth Century, a title which
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_15:0.0000:Mr. Tennyson suggested. The Laureate also
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_16:0.0000:contributed an introductory sonnet to the first
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0163_17:0.0000:number of the new periodical, which has been
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_1:0.0500:Haslemere, a rugged common, furze-clad, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_2:0.0250:purpled over with brightest cinerea, over-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_3:0.0250:looks a long stretch of deep shadowy hollows,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_5:0.0250:crested chalk-ridge of Mid-Surrey, behind
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_6:0.0000:which, in the dim distance, is the faint outline
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_7:0.0250:of the Berkshire hills. From this common a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_8:0.0000:narrow roadway, overarched with sycamores,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_9:0.0250:oaks, and hazel bushes, like a Devonshire lane,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_10:0.0000:trends upward to Blackburn. On either hand
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_11:0.0000:the way is lined with hazels, Kentish cobs, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_12:0.0250:hollies, all knee-deep in ferns, and mingled with
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_13:0.0000:these are feathery birches in all stages of growth,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_14:0.0000:from the ruddiness of supple youth to the silver
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_15:0.0250:whiteness of lusty age. The road lies along a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_16:0.0000:ridge, and on either side the steep combes dip
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_17:0.0000:down to sombre-wooded valleys, with here a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_18:0.0500:long avenue of tall tremulous birches, and there
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_19:0.0250:a trim glade, through which one catches the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_20:0.0000:gleam of corn-fields ; on the further slopes, the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_21:0.0250:sparkle of a little stream, winding among the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_22:0.0250:trees below, or the russet walls of gabled man-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0164_24:0.0500:hollows or the hillsides. In this pleasant
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_3:0.0000:boundary-line between sweet Surrey and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_8:0.0250:blue of the sandy soil, and the warm orange
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_9:0.0250:of the Sussex gravel shine. Then suddenly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_10:0.0250:the view opens over the wild down to a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_11:0.0250:broad expanse of rolling hills and valleys,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_12:0.0250:where cultivation has encroached but slowly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_13:0.0000:on the domain of the ancient Hursts, and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_14:0.0000:thence to a distance as illimitable as the sea.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_15:0.0250:Far away to the south-east a soft, grey curve,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_16:0.0000:hardly darker than the thin veil of clouds
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_17:0.0250:overhanging it, is said to be Fairlight Down.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_18:0.0000:Through a gap in the lofty South Downs one
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_19:0.0000:looks over the valley of the Arun to where the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_20:0.0500:placid river glides into the restless sea by Little-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_22:0.0500:and rising high above the long ridges, marks
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_24:0.0000:Shoreham ; and higher still, but farther and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_25:0.0000:fainter, is Ditchling Beacon, that overlooks the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0165_26:0.0000:battle-field of Lewes and the silver windings of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_2:0.0250:white stand of Ascot and the dark wooded
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_3:0.0000:knoll of Windsor. In a furrow of the hills that
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_4:0.0250:roll in lessening waves up the nearer distance
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_6:0.0000:hill, whose rugged scarp rises sheer from the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_7:0.0000:valley, is Shillingly, with its broad lake gleam-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_8:0.0250:ing among the dense dark foliage. In the midst
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_9:0.0500:of a scene so richly varied that its very wealth
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_10:0.0250:might baffle the art of a Linnell or a Vicat Cole,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_11:0.0000:the Laureate has built himself, if not " a lordly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_13:0.0250:solitude away from the haunts of the crowd and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0166_16:0.0500:migratory flight to his summer-house by the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_0:0.0250:MR. TENNYSON AT HOME. 153
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_2:0.0500:abode. Whether this yearning for lofty things
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_3:0.0250:is innate or simply a natural sequence of an early
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_7:0.0250:written in later years. When the most familiar
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_9:0.0500:descriptions of' hill-scenery were vague and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_10:0.0500:dreamlike, while his pictures of surrounding
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_11:0.0500:scenery were happily hit off by a few fine
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_12:0.0500:touches. " The level waste, the rounding grey,"
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_19:0.0250:ality ; but the mountains were enveloped in a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_20:0.0250:mist of unreality. As gradually the mist has
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_21:0.0500:rolled away the hills have become more vividly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0167_22:0.0500:real and powerfully distinct, until the reader
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_4:0.0500:pine on either hand ; but instead of forming
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_8:0.0000:down into deep gorges. Nothing of the house
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_9:0.0500:but the chimney-tops or the gables and pinnacles
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_13:0.0000:stone walls, girdles it closely about ; and from
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_14:0.0500:the outside it is impossible to get any idea of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_15:0.0250:the bright flower-gardens and pleasant glades
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_19:0.0000:rugged face of the sandstone cliff, and the level
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_20:0.0250:terrace, stretching along the southern front, is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_21:0.0250:only kept from sliding down to the fields below
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_22:0.0500:by sturdy brick buttresses and arcaded ramparts.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0168_24:0.0000:mirable taste, with wide-mullioned windows,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_1:0.0250:sky-line picturesquely. Within, everything is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_2:0.0250:ordered with a quiet refined elegance that has
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_3:0.0000:in it, perhaps, just a soup$on of an affectation of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_4:0.0250:aestheticism not quite .in keeping with the spirit
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_5:0.0000:either of modern or of mediaeval life. The hall,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_6:0.0000:in spite of its richly-tessellated pavement, has a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_7:0.0000:delightful sense of coolness in its soft half light.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_8:0.0500:The lofty rooms have broad high windows, the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_9:0.0500:light from which is tempered by delicately
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_10:0.0500:coloured hangings ; walls of the negative tints
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_11:0.0000:in which modern decorators delight, diapered
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_12:0.0250:with dull gold ; and panelled ceilings of darkly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_15:0.0250:mising stiffness, flank the table, typifying the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_16:0.0000:poet's sterner moods ; while in cosy corners are
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_17:0.0500:comfortable lounges that indicate a tendency
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_18:0.0500:to yield sometimes to the soft seductions of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_19:0.0000:more effeminate inspirations. Nowhere is the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_20:0.0000:spirit vexed by garish ornament or the eye by
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_21:0.0250:glaring colours. A few good etchings and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_22:0.0250:paintings hang on the walls ; among them an
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_23:0.0000:excellent copy of the Peter Martyr, which is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_24:0.0000:doubly valuable since the destruction of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_25:0.0250:original. But there is one room in which all
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0169_26:0.0250:that is most interesting in this house centres.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_4:0.0500:The air is heavy with tlje odour of an incense
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_5:0.0500:not unfamiliar to men of letters ; and if you
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_6:0.0250:could doubt whence it arose, your doubts would
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_7:0.0250:be speedily dissolved as the occupant of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_10:0.0500:figure, though slightly bent, bears the burden of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_11:0.0500:sixty-six years lightly ; the dark mass of hair
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_19:0.0250:ventionalities of life is thoroughly natural and
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_20:0.0000:unaffected. His suit of light grey hanging
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_21:0.0000:about him in many a fold, like the hide of a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_22:0.0000:rhinoceros, the loose ill-fitting collar and care-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_23:0.0250:lessly knotted tie, the wide low boots, are
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0170_25:0.0500:or with the foppishness of a Byron. The
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_9:0.0500:sting of envious criticism was bad enough to a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_11:0.0000:have been so bad as the pertinacity of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_12:0.0250:curious, who invaded the solitude so dear to a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_13:0.0000:man of Tennyson's reflective temperament, until
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_17:0.0250:added insult to injury by flaunting their nation-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_18:0.0250:ality constantly in his face, until the sight of a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_20:0.0250:tive dislike to prying inquisitiveness goaded
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_21:0.0250:him into treating all whom he did not know as
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_22:0.0250:if they were in act or intention his persecutors.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0171_25:0.0250:receive men brusquely, almost rudely, he reads
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_1:0.0500:character with wonderful quickness ; and when
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_2:0.0250:he changes his first unfavourable impression, he
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_4:0.0000:face betrays him at once. In place of the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_5:0.0250:cynical curve into which habit has settled the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_7:0.0250:mouth, and the eyes will light with a welcome,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_11:0.0500:no mercy. Though the poet, like most thinkers,
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_13:0.0500:his powers of conversation are considerable. He
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_16:0.0250:sound like provincialism, but no person could
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_17:0.0250:be more correctly emphatic in pronunciation ;
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_18:0.0250:and his ear is as readily offended, if a word be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0172_21:0.0250:colouring ; and he does not allow the forms of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_2:0.0500:all companions of that charmed circle which is
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_3:0.0500:narrowing so fast year after year. But his chief
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_4:0.0250:delight is not in communion with his fellows.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_5:0.0250:Rather it is to sit here in this quiet secluded
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_6:0.0000:study, surrounded by a few choice books of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_7:0.0000:favourite authors ; and when not working at the
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_8:0.0250:desk, by the window that overlooks the pine-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_9:0.0500:glen and the purple down westward, to lounge
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_10:0.0500:by the larger one that looks down on the bright
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_11:0.0250:blossoming terrace over the dense belt of
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_12:0.0250:beeches and hazels, where the whirring of night-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_13:0.0250:jars sounds ceaselessly in the twilight, away to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_14:0.0000:the grey lines of undulating hills and the streak
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_16:0.0250:pipe is ever ready at hand, and a huge tobacco-
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_17:0.0000:jar, big enough for an ancestral urn, on the floor
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_18:0.0250:beside him. At other times he will wander
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_20:0.0000:directions through the tall hazel-twigs which here
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_21:0.0500:his house surround, where one comes suddenly
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_22:0.0250:on a little secluded glade bright with mossy
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_23:0.0000:verdure, or a garden laden with odours from a
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_24:0.0000:score of pine-trees, or a bigger lawn devoted to
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0173_25:0.0000:the innocent pursuit of croquet or lawn-tennis.
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0174_3:0.0250:mien and the eccentricity of his costume. In
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0174_4:0.0250:all his out-of-door excursions he is sure to be
alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0174_5:0.0500:accompanied by one or other of his handsome

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0178_17:0.0500:in that quiet retreat. Grasby is beautifully

alfredtennysonhi00nicouoft_0179_13:0.0000:friend Dr. Kerr. He died there in 1879, and

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_0:0.0000:PREFACE.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_5:0.0000:The investigation was begun as an inquiry into the pseudo-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_6:0.0250:Chaucerian Court of Love ; and in the first chapter a rearrangement
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_7:0.0000:of the text of that poem, and in the seventh certain conclusions as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_8:0.0000:to its sources, represent the main results of this inquiry. But the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_9:0.0000:search for sources led naturally to a wider and wider extension of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_10:0.0000:the field, until the dissertation finally included a general account of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_11:0.0000:the rise and development of some of the leading features of mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_12:0.0000:love-allegory.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_13:0.0500:The number of instances I have found of the central conception
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_14:0.0000:of a court held by the God or Goddess of Love and attended by per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_15:0.0000:sonifications of abstract qualities is so large as almost to justify the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_16:0.0000:treatment of this class of allegory as a separate literary genre. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_17:0.0000:chapter on the Statutes of Love attempts to trace the origin and indi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_18:0.0000:cate the extent of one of the most interesting features of this genre,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_19:0.0000:and at the same time presents a body of material for the study of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_20:0.0000:mediaeval social ideals. The chapter on Philobone is devoted to a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_21:0.0000:short analysis of a familiar type in the literature of the Middle Ages ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_22:0.0000:and that on the Birds' Matins contains a collection of evidence pos-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0007_23:0.0000:sessing interest other than literary in its bearing on the mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_0:0.0250:.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_3:0.0500:ja p u t forth with the greatest diffidence, is that in which I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_4:0.0250:ventured to deal with the vexed question of the existence of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_5:0.0000:the institution known as a Court of Love. The view which is here
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_6:0.0000:advocated occurred to me as the result of a stucjy of the prevailing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_7:0.0000:Iferary and social occupations of the earlier Middle Ages, and I have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_9:0.0000:ingested it What I attempt to do is not to make any fresh
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_10:0.0250:either of the parties already in the field, but to propose
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_11:0.0000:change of issue. The question, that is, as it appears to me, is not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_12:0.0000:whether or not Courts of Love ever existed, but whether the prac-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_13:0.0000:tfett on which some have based the belief in the existence of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_14:0.0000:such an institution were serious or playful. That they were playful,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_15:0.0000:hut yet socially important and influential, is the conclusion to which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_16:0.0250:the evidence here collected seems to point.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_17:0.0500:I owe acknowledgment to the work of scholars who have preceded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_18:0.0000:me in parts of the same field, and of whose results I have freely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_19:0.0000:availed myself. Such are the contributions of Gaston Paris to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_20:0.0000:studies generally, and, with Trojel and Rajna, to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_21:0.0000:on the institution of the Court of Love ; of Raab to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_22:0.0250:of patristic allegory ; of Dammann to that of Proven9al alle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_23:0.0000:gory ; of E. Langlois to the study of the Roman de la Rose ; of A.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_25:0.0000:of L. F. Mott to the study of Courtly Love ; and of many others.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_26:0.0000:obligations I have tried to make explicit as they occur, but I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_27:0.0250:to have avoided omissions. For these and for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0008_28:0.0250:which are sure to have escaped me I can only plead

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0009_4:0.0000:more than I can adequately express for the generosity with which

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_0:0.0250:THE ORIGINS AND SOURCES OF THE
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_2:0.0250:CHAPTER I.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_5:0.0250:of Trinity College, Cambridge, and is marked R. 3. 19. This
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_6:0.0500:MS. is a " miscellaneous collection of Middle English pieces of vari-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_7:0.0000:ous dates," and of these our poem is No. 59. 1 From this source it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_8:0.0000:was printed in 1562, by Stow, in his Woorkes of Geffrey Chaucer,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_9:0.0000:newly printed with diuers Addicions which were neuer in printe before.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_10:0.0000:From the fact that this volume included poems ascribed by Stow
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_11:0.0000:himself to Lydgate, it is clear that the editor did not intend to imply
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_12:0.0000:that the " diuers Addicions " were necessarily Chaucer's ; but the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_13:0.0000:title proved misleading, and, as a result, the Court of Love has been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_14:0.0250:included in the complete editions of Chaucer down to our own time.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_15:0.0250:The baselessness of the ascription has been completely demonstrated
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_16:0.0250:by Professor Skeat, 2 and need not be discussed here.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_17:0.0250:The part of the MS. containing the Court of Love is in a hand of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_18:0.0250:the sixteenth century, and Skeat is now inclined to place the composi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_19:0.0250:tion of the poem after 1532, the date of Thynne's edition of Chaucer,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0011_20:0.0250:which he thinks the author probably used. This he supports by an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_7:0.0500:He mentions also the five or six poems by Chaucer which, as will be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_8:0.0000:shown later, influenced the Court of Love, and suggests that he may
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_9:0.0000:have learned his metre from Scottish authors such as Henryson and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_10:0.0000:Dunbar. On these grounds, and from the general impression pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_11:0.0250:duced on him by the poem, he inclines to place the author with Sack-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_13:0.0500:se arguments do not seem to me very cogent. The parallel
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_14:0.0250:with the Roman de la Rose passage has no force. The author of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_15:0.0000:the Court of Love could have known the Chaucer poems before the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_16:0.0000:publication of Thynne's edition; Henryson was dead before 1500,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_17:0.0000:and Dunbar had written all his most important work before 1510.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_18:0.0000:Again, if a passage of the Court of Love be read with one from Sur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_19:0.0250:rey or Sackville, the earlier date of the former becomes immediately
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_20:0.0000:evident Not only is the language manifestly older, but the literary
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_21:0.0000:attitude of the author is so distinctly mediaeval that one feels at once
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_22:0.0000:that his place is rather with Hawes than with Surrey. Allowing an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_23:0.0000:interval to account for the loss of some of Hawes's inflections, we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_24:0.0500:shall probably be not far astray in fixing the date about the end of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_25:0.0000:the first quarter of the sixteenth century.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_28:0.0250:After a prologue containing a dedication to his lady, for whose
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_29:0.0250:pleasure he has written the poem, an invocation of the Muses, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_30:0.0000:an apology to " metridens " for his " lak of science," the poet tells
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_31:0.0250:how, when he was eighteen, he was summoned by Mercury to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_32:0.0250:Court of Love. Setting out on his journey, he overtook people
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0012_33:0.0000:swarming like bees in the same direction ; and, following them, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_1:0.0000:came to a gorgeous castle glittering with gold and precious stones,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_2:0.0000:and painted outside and in with daisies to signify that Alcestis dwelt
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_3:0.0000:there, who, with Admetus, acted as vicegerent for Venus. He entered
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_4:0.0000:a hall hung with arras and cloth of gold, and found the King and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_5:0.0000:Queen sitting in state, wearing their crowns, and surrounded by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_6:0.0000:many courtiers, including Danger and Disdain and " the ladies gode
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_7:0.0000:ninetene." He was particularly struck with admiration for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_8:0.0000:Queen's beauty, and for her eyes, the beams of which " were shapen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_9:0.0000:lich a dart." " In mewet " he uttered a stanza expressing his wonder.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_10:0.0000:As he looked round, he saw Philobone, the Queen's " chamberer "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_11:0.0000:and a friend of his, who came and asked his errand. She particularly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_12:0.0000:wanted to know whether he came of his own accord ; and when he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_13:0.0000:confessed that Mercury had been sent for him, she warned him that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_14:0.0000:the anger of the King would be sure to fall on him for his long delay
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_15:0.0500:in coming to Court. He ought to have come as soon as he was wise
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_16:0.0250:enough to tell a woman from a swan.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_18:0.0000:temple where, in a raised tabernacle, sat Venus and Cupid [appar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_19:0.0000:ently in effigy, v. 223]. The windows and walls of the temple were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_20:0.0000:painted with the stories of Dido and ^Eneas, of Anelida and Arcite,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_21:0.0000:and many other princely lovers ; and the building itself was thronged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_22:0.0000:with people. There were true lovers in blue, unfortunate ones in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_23:0.0250:black, priests, nuns, and hermits in white, russet, and green, all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_24:0.0250:bewailing their woful condition (v. 266).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_31:0.0500:On the plea of bashfulness, and on condition of future fidelity, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_32:0.0250:was pardoned, and handed over to an officer called Rigor, that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_33:0.0000:he might take the oath to the Statutes of the Court of Love. After
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_34:0.0000:reading the twenty Statutes for men [which will be discussed later in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_35:0.0500:detail], he turned over to the Statutes for women ; but just then Rigor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0013_36:0.0500:noticed him and sharply stopped him.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_1:0.0250:The oath having been taken, Rigor sent him back to the temple
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_2:0.0000:tilth hit fellow-neophytes, instructing them to pray, those who had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_3:0.0250:met their fate, for wisdom to guide them in service, those who were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_4:0.0250:yed," for grace that their destiny might be honorable
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_5:0.0250:and happy. Rpund the shrine they found thousands on their knees :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_6:0.0000:unfortunate lovers offering prayers for pity and vengeance, and fortu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_7:0.0000:lute ones singing praises, extolling the omnipotence of love and its
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_8:0.0000:power as "exyler ay of vice and sin." The poet himself made con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_9:0.0000:fession and prayer, and told how one night in a vision he had seen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_10:0.0250:l beautiful lady who made his heart dance a little. Who she was he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_11:0.0250:did not know, but her he should like to serve and win.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_12:0.0500:Close by he noticed a jewelled shrine which Philobone told him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_13:0.0000:was the sepulchre of Pity, who died from " tender herte " because she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_14:0.0000:saw an eagle tear a fly to pieces. Formerly, his guide informed him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_15:0.0250:in closest confidence, Pity was more serviceable to lovers than any
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_16:0.0500:one in Court, but now nothing availed but " hot corage."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_17:0.0250:Now he is to meet the fairest lady under the sun, and Philobone
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_18:0.0000:instructs him in modest behavior, warning him against forwardness,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_19:0.0000:and making rather obscure allusions to some previous little affairs
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_20:0.0000:of his. They enter a chamber and behold Rosial, who is described
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_21:0.0000:after the traditional fashion, with straight nose, lily brow, full red
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_22:0.0000:lips, even teeth, golden hair, sweet breath, slender figure, and so on.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_23:0.0000:He is deeply wounded by Love's dart, and retires to write a " bill"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_24:0.0000:in seven stanzas. He returns and presents this, but the lady says she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_25:0.0000:does not know anything about him. He describes himself as Philo-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_26:0.0000:genet, clerk of Cambridge, maker of love songs, and writer " in art
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_28:0.0250:coldness causes him to faint. This moves her to relent somewhat,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_29:0.0000:and she promises to set his heart at ease ; but she charges him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_30:0.0250:to keep the Statutes, granting, at his request, with a blush that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_31:0.0500:makes her name appropriate, a modification of the objectionable
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0014_32:0.0250:sixteenth
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_8:0.0250:In the midst of a speech made by Flattery, probably with reference
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_9:0.0250:to Philogenet, the next stanza (v. 1093) begins with a question as to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_10:0.0500:why some people dressed in black and white and gray are so sad.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_11:0.0000:This introduces the description of a series of groups of complainants
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_12:0.0250:friars, nuns, poverty-stricken and deformed lovers, and, lastly, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_13:0.0250:company who are " waried and misseid " by the Fates, and who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_14:0.0500:curse Nature for giving them life.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_18:0.0000:Just as these last two enter (v. 1316), another break occurs, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_19:0.0000:we find Rosial explaining how Pity had come to life again and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_20:0.0000:induced her to take mercy on Philogenet. The lover bursts out
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_21:0.0250:into thanks to Pity and Rosial, and Rosial tells him to dwell with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_22:0.0500:her till the feast held in May by the King of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_23:0.0000:The remainder of the poem (vv. 135 2- end) consists of a parody of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_24:0.0000:the Matins and Lauds of the Hours of the Blessed Virgin, sung by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_25:0.0000:the birds in honor of the God of Love. After the service all the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_26:0.0000:court go forth to gather hawthorn, and pelt one another with flowers,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_27:0.0000:and the poet is smitten through the heart with a " trew-love, plited
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0015_28:0.0000:many-fold," thrown by his lady.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_2:0.0000:sponding leaves in the original from which the existing copy was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_3:0.0000:made. ' Hut I am by no means convinced that at v. 1022 anything
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_4:0.0000:has dropped out at all. The appearance of a conclusion in the use
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_5:0.0000:of a perfect tense in v. 1020 is indubitable; but it seems to me
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_6:0.0250:much more probable that at one time the poem did actually end
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_9:0.0500:As for the gap at v. 1316, it does not seem possible to avoid the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_10:0.0500:inference that some stanzas are lost, in which the second round of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_11:0.0500:the Court was completed, and Philogenet brought again into the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_14:0.0000:text. In the second round of the Court, which occupies exactly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_15:0.0000:those stanzas between w. 1022 and 1317, i.e. between the gaps
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_16:0.0000:recognized by the editor, we have (i) a group of allegorical figures
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_17:0.0000:described ; (2) a group of typical figures complainants ; (3) another
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_18:0.0000:group of allegorical figures; and at v. 1092, where (2) begins, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_19:0.0000:at v. 1177, where (3) begins, the transition is so abrupt that we are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_20:0.0000:led to suspect some confusion. As the poem at present stands, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_21:0.0000:second round seems a somewhat meaningless and confused repetition
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_22:0.0000:of features occurring in the earlier part. If, however, we remove

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_27:0.0000:The second round of the court is now seen to have the definite object
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0016_28:0.0500:of introducing a new kind of allegory, that dealing with abstractions,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_6:0.0000:character in the account of Philogenet's first visit to the temple, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_7:0.0000:would immediately precede the summons to the King's presence.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_8:0.0000:No changes are necessary to make them fit here except a few in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_9:0.0000:punctuation, which are required to make sense in any case. Pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_10:0.0000:fessor Skeat prints vv. 1093-1103 without any quotation marks
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_11:0.0000:whatever ; but if we read them punctuated as follows, supposing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_12:0.0000:that Philogenet asks the first question and Philobone answers him,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_13:0.0250:the whole passage becomes intelligible, and the poem, except for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_14:0.0250:hopeless lacuna at v. 1316, is now continuous.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0017_32:0.0250:features which will form the main lines of the investigation are these :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_2:0.0000:Venus, or by representatives of these divinities, and attended by a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_3:0.0250:throng of personified abstractions acting as courtiers; second, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_4:0.0000:;tes of Love a series of commandments to be observed by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_5:0.0000:those who owe allegiance to the Lord of Love ; third, the figure of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_6:0.0000:Philobone the person who acts as guide and. adviser to the hero
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_7:0.0000:of the allegory ; fourth, the association of birds with Venus ; fifth,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_8:0.0000:the parody of Church services as exemplified in the Birds' Litany
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_9:0.0000:which closes the Court of Love. After an attempt to indicate the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_10:0.0000:beginnings of this kind of allegory in general before the mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_11:0.0000:period, each of these features will be followed through the chief
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_12:0.0000:mediaeval European literatures that dealt with such forms ; next, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_13:0.0000:chapter will be devoted to a consideration of the immediate sources
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_14:0.0000:used by the author of the Court of Love ; another to the relation
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_15:0.0000:of the allegory to the institutions and pageants known by similar
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_16:0.0250:names ; and finally, some account will be given of the development
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_17:0.0250:of certain of these ideas after the date of our poem.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_19:0.0000:THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN ALLEGORY.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_22:0.0000:erable number of literary types types differing as much from one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_23:0.0000:another as, e.g., the Beast-fable, The Pilgrim's Progress, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_24:0.0000:parable of the Prodigal Son it will be convenient to limit it for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_25:0.0000:present purpose to that kind of symbolical narrative or description
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_26:0.0250:in which the main characters are personifications of abstract ideas
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_27:0.0250:and qualities.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0018_29:0.0000:literatures is beset with peculiar difficulties, chiefly on account of its
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_2:0.0000:nite personalities, until they reached a pitch of anthropomorphism.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_3:0.0250:But along with this growth in individuality there was an extension
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_4:0.0000:of their sovereignty into the domain of moral and intellectual quali-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_5:0.0000:ties ; so that when in the later, more sceptical times there came a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_6:0.0000:decay of the belief in their separate, concrete, personal existence,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_7:0.0000:their numbers continued to receive additions from a great variety of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_8:0.0000:sources, additions made by men who found the old forms of language
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_9:0.0000:and even of worship convenient means of expression long after they
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_10:0.0000:had ceased to be bound by the implications of these forms. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_11:0.0000:Neo-Platonists, for example, found room in their system for an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_12:0.0000:indefinite number of minor divinities, embodiments of various moral
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_13:0.0000:and spiritual ideas, which they regarded as subordinate to the Supreme
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_14:0.0000:Being, and which in name they identified with the ancestral deities of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_15:0.0000:the Greeks and Romans. 1 The generous hospitality offered by the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_16:0.0000:Roman Pantheon to the gods of alien nations, and the deification of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_17:0.0000:the Emperors, are other instances ; and perhaps more striking from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_18:0.0000:the present point of view is the practice of raising statues to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_19:0.0250:separate qualities of individual heroes, as to the Valor of Caesar or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_20:0.0250:the Clemency of Augustus.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_21:0.0000:It is clear that in this last class of cases we have something very
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_22:0.0000:far from the conception of the gods in Homer, and within measurable
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_23:0.0000:distance of the ideas of Beauty and Pity as courtiers of Love ; yet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_24:0.0000:nothing is harder than to say where mythology ends and allegory
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_25:0.0000:begins. Even if we go back to Homer we find the difficulty ; for he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_26:0.0000:places abstractions like Fear, Rumor, and Strife side by side with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0019_27:0.0500:great gods, though the former have no regular place in the theogony,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_27:0.0000:and arrows, which we shall constantly find in the mediaeval allegories,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_28:0.0000:and which are too common in classical art to need special illustration.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_29:0.0250:Note, too, the association with birds and roses.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_30:0.0250:This Triumph of Cupid leads us to another feature of mediaeval

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_35:0.0000:appendage to the palace. When we come to the mediaeval period
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_36:0.0000:further instances of this will be produced, and the connection of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0021_37:0.0500:two even amounting to a confusion goes very far back. In the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0022_22:0.0000:later descriptions are elaborated. The palace of Apollo in the begin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0022_23:0.0250:ning of 'Book ii of Ovid's Metamorphoses is an example, and may also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0022_24:0.0000:be a source, of the gorgeous descriptions of castles such as we have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0022_25:0.0500:in the Court of Lore:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0023_10:0.0500:placed the House of Fame in Met., xii, 39-63, which, through the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0023_36:0.0250:After the beginning of the Christian era these traditions continued
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_1:0.0500:found in Statius, e.g., 7^., iii, 426, and Silvac, iii, 3, i-7- In A P U ~
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_2:0.0000:letus we have them not infrequently. In the story of Cupid and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_3:0.0000:Psyche in Book vi of his Metamorphoses we have several instances.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_4:0.0000:Thus Venus threatens Cupid that she will call to her aid his enemy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_5:0.0250:Sobrietas, and where Venus is persecuting Psyche these passages
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_6:0.0000:occur : " Jamque fores ei dominae proximanti occurrit una de famu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_7:0.0000:litio Veneris nomine Consuetudo statimque quantum maxime potuit

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_10:0.0250:Trinities, ancillae meae?'" 2 and forthwith these servants come
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_11:0.0250:forth and proceed to torture Psyche.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_12:0.0250:In Apuleius, too, we have a suggestion of the Palace of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_13:0.0000:Psyche, immediately after her mysterious marriage, falls into a sleep,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_14:0.0000:and awaking finds herself in a grove in the midst of which is a foun-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_15:0.0000:tain with crystal waters. " Prope fontis adlapsum domus regia est,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_16:0.0000:aedificata non humanis manibus sed divinis artibus. . . . Summa

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_21:0.0000:building materials, and the picture decorations all become regular
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_22:0.0250:features of the mediaeval House of Venus.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_23:0.0500:But as early as Apuleius there is a change in the mental attitude
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_24:0.0000:of authors towards even the most august divinities, and what Puech
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_25:0.0000:says of Claudian begins to be true long before : " Whatever care
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_26:0.0000:Claudian took to conserve the traditions of the past, he yielded in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_27:0.0000:spite of himself to the influence of his age, an age in which mythol-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_28:0.0000:ogy had ceased to be more than a poetic convention, when theology,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_29:0.0000:striving after a vague deism or pantheism of the Stoic kind and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_30:0.0000:re-establishing the fabulous divinities only as attributes, as hypos-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_31:0.0000:tascs, deprived them of their life and their humanity. At times,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_32:0.0000:also, he seems to have planned to substitute for these ancient gods
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0024_33:0.0250:so mocked by the Christians, less compromising abstractions." 4
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_1:0.0000:more and more evident in the later pagan literature. Personifica-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_2:0.0000:tions occur with greater frequency. In one passage 1 in Claudian
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_3:0.0000:(flor. A.D. 400) Alecto appears surrounded by Discord, the nurse of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_4:0.0000:war ; imperious Hunger ; Old Age, neighbor of Death ; Disease ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_5:0.0250:Jealousy ; Grief, mourning in a ragged veil ; Fear ; blind Audacity ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_20:0.0000:ing of Venus to which Cupid goes in the poem De Nuptiis Honorii
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_21:0.0000:et Mariae to announce to his mother his conquest of the heart of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_22:0.0000:Honorius. The abode of the goddess is in Cyprus, in a flat plain on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_23:0.0000:the top of a mountain inaccessible to the foot of man, and surrounded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_24:0.0250:by a golden wall built by Vulcan as the price of his wife's kisses.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_25:0.0000:Here there blows no wind nor does winter bring snow, but in per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_26:0.0000:petual spring the flowers bloom, and among the trees sing only those
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_27:0.0000:birds whose song has been approved by Venus. The very leaves love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0025_28:0.0000:omnisque vicissim Felix arbor amat. There are two fountains, one sweet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0026_3:0.0500:lesser Loves. Other divinities dwell there Licentia, Irae, Excubiae,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0026_16:0.0000:She needs no mirror, for the admiration of all around sufficiently

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_17:0.0500:Of allegory in the limited sense in which we have defined it there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_18:0.0000:is not a great variety in the Bible. By far the most frequent per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_19:0.0000:sonification in the Old Testament is that of Wisdom. In the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_20:0.0000:Proverbs we have her crying aloud in the streets, 1 holding length of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_21:0.0000:days in her right hand and riches and honor in her left, 2 making
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_22:0.0000:subtilty her dwelling, 3 building her house and sending forth her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_23:0.0000:maidens. 4 In the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon she is radiant and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_24:0.0000:fadeth not away, 5 is easily beheld of them that desire to know her, 6
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_25:0.0000:goeth about herself seeking them that are worthy of her, 7 is the arti-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_26:0.0000:ficer of all things, 8 and is sought by the speaker as a bride. 9 In
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0027_27:0.0250:Ecdesiasticus she exalteth her sons, and taketh hold of them that

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_9:0.0250:From the mass of symbolism in the Apocalypse a few instances can
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_10:0.0000:be selected : the figure on the pale horse representing Death, 2 another
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_11:0.0000:on the red horse apparently representing War, 3 the scarlet woman
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_12:0.0000:who personifies Babylon, 4 and most important, the figuring of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_13:0.0000:Church as the Bride of Christ. 6 The allegorical significance of these
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_14:0.0000:was increased, and many passages not originally figurative were made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_15:0.0000:so, by the well-known allegorizing tendency of the Church in the Early
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_16:0.0000:and Middle Ages. 6 One instance of the kind of allegorical story

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_19:0.0000:Meantime we have to consider instances in which the Fathers turned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_20:0.0000:to Christian uses the kind of personifications the tradition of which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_21:0.0000:had come down from classical sources.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0028_22:0.0250:Tertullian in his book DC Patientia, cap. i5, 8 describes Patience

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_4:0.0000:which later becomes familiar as the Battle of the Vices and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_5:0.0000:Virtues, which found its first extended treatment at the hands of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_6:0.0250:the Spaniard Prudentius about A.D. 400, and its last and greatest,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_7:0.0250:after an almost continuous tradition of twelve hundred years, in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_8:0.0000:works of Bunyan.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_9:0.0500:According to Puech, 2 Prudentius probably received the suggestion
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_10:0.0000:for his Psychomachia from a passage in the De Spectaculis of Tertul-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_12:0.0250:Si scenicae doctrinae delectant, satis nobis litterarum est, satis uersuum,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_20:0.0000:gramme meme de la Psychomachia" The same idea is found in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_21:0.0250:Cyprian also, in a passage not noted by Puech. "Obsessa mens
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0029_22:0.0000:hominis et undique diaboli infestatione uallata uix occurrit singulis

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_12:0.0250:cord ia with Discordia. One group has some Court of Love figures.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_23:0.0500:The influence of this work was very great not only in Spain, where,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_24:0.0000:according to Puech, it inspired the autos sacramentales (which are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_25:0.0000:often only " Psychomachies dramatiques " 2 ) and other works, but in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_26:0.0000:many foreign countries as well. Features which may plausibly be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_27:0.0000:derived from it are to be seen in the sermons of the later Fathers,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_28:0.0000:and one cannot fail to notice how strongly it suggests the Morality
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_29:0.0500:Play. It would take us too far afield to follow the descendants of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_30:0.0000:the Psychomachia down through the theological and didactic literature
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_31:0.0000:of the following centuries, but one instance may be quoted to show
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0030_32:0.0000:the persistence of that kind of allegory which Prudentius indeed did
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_1:0.0000:In connection with the allegorizing of passages of Scripture origi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_2:0.0000:nally free from any intentional parabolic signification, a sermon by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_3:0.0250:Bernard of Clairvaux (d. 1153), the preacher of the Second Crusade,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_4:0.0000:was mentioned. We have five Parables^ ascribed to St. Bernard,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_5:0.0000:and all of them, though founded upon different passages of Scripture,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_6:0.0000:approach the type of the Battle of the Vices and the Virtues. In one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_7:0.0250:of these, starting from St. Paul's chapter on Charity, he tells of a King
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_8:0.0000:who had three daughters, Fides, Spes, and Caritas, whom he puts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_9:0.0000:in charge of the town of Mansoul, in which are three castles, Ratio-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_10:0.0000:nabilitas, Concupiscibilitas, and Irascibilitas. To each daughter is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_11:0.0000:assigned a castle, and each sets a guardian with attendants to watch
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_12:0.0000:over it. Fides appoints Prudentia and gives her as associates Obe-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_13:0.0000:dientia, Patientia, Dispensatio, Ordo, and Disciplina ; Spes appoints
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_14:0.0250:Sobrietas and gives her Discretio, Continentia, Constantia, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_15:0.0000:Humilitas, with Silentium as doorkeeper; Caritas appoints Pietas
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_16:0.0000:(who is accompanied by Munditia Corporis and "congruas exercita-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_17:0.0000:tiones, videlicet lectiones, meditationes, orationes, et spirituales affec-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_18:0.0000:tiones") and Beatitude, with Peace as doorkeeper. The whole town is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_19:0.0000:governed by Liberum Arbitrium. These arrangements having been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_20:0.0000:made, the daughters retire, and the town is attacked by the Adver-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_21:0.0500:sary at the head of an army of wickedness. They gain entrance by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_22:0.0000:the doors of Rationabilitas and Concupiscibilitas, Liberum Arbitrium
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_23:0.0000:is bound, and Blasphemia, Luxuria, and Superbia hold sway. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_24:0.0000:three daughters seek help from their father, who sends Timor and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_25:0.0000:Gratia with an army of Virtues. Liberum Arbitrium is liberated,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_26:0.0000:and, it is hoped, will remain under the dominion of Gratia for-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_27:0.0500:ever.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_29:0.0000:with biblical subjects, and their knowledge of pagan literature is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_30:0.0000:shown in other ways than the Psychomachia might indicate. Thus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_31:0.0000:we find them turning their ingenuity in interpretation to the symbol-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_32:0.0000:ism of the God of Love himself, though in no very friendly spirit.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_33:0.0000:The features dwelt on are the - usual conventions of classical art,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0031_34:0.0250:but they are so constantly used in that class of mediaeval poems that

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_21:0.0500:Other passages of this sort could be quoted, but these are suffi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_22:0.0000:cient to show the attitude of the early Churchmen towards even the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_23:0.0000:least serious of the old divinities. It was about a thousand years
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_24:0.0000:before it was easy for a Christian clerk to regard the winged god
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_25:0.0000:without a frown ; and when we again come upon poets describing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_26:0.0000:the House of Venus without deprecating gestures, we realize that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0032_27:0.0500:we are in a new world, that of the love-allegories of the Middle

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_1:0.0000:In the present chapter we have attempted to discover how much
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_2:0.0000:of the common material of the Court of Love allegory was a legacy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_3:0.0000:from preceding literatures. The investigation has dealt mainly with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_4:0.0000:two points the source of those allegorical figures that form the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_5:0.0000:courtiers of Venus, and the beginnings of the descriptions of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_6:0.0000:Palace of Venus. Of both of these we have found evidence of much
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_7:0.0000:more than a trace. The Palace seems to be derived almost entirely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_8:0.0000:from the classics, unless ^e suppose that the account of the New
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_9:0.0000:Jerusalem in the Revelation may also have given suggestions. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_10:0.0000:personifications, as was perhaps to have been expected, are found
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_11:0.0000:both in the classics and in Hebrew literature. The Christian con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_12:0.0000:tribution is increased by the patristic tendency to force an even
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_13:0.0000:fourfold meaning out of all Scripture, so that the clerical mind had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_14:0.0000:its familiarity with personification increased by many instances which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_15:0.0000:would never have been recognized as such by their authors.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_16:0.0000:This matter of personification 1 has been dealt with much more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_17:0.0000:fully than will be possible or desirable in the succeeding chapters.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_18:0.0000:We have, as it were, been collecting material to show from what soil
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_19:0.0000:the allegory of the Court of Love sprang ; having realized that, we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_20:0.0000:can now confine our attention more exclusively to the growth of the

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_25:0.0500:chapter will be according to language: Provencal, Old French,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_26:0.0500:Italian, Middle-High German, and English. Latin documents, be-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_27:0.0250:longing as they do to various, and often to uncertain, nationalities,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0033_28:0.0250:will be discussed at points where their relation to vernacular pieces

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_3:0.0250:We begin with the work of a troubadour of the end of the twelfth
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_4:0.0000:century, Guiraut de Calanso, who wrote his A leis cui am de cor e de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_5:0.0000:sabtr l to pay homage to a lady. It deals with three kinds of love, to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_6:0.0000:be understood as carnal, natural (i.e. that of relatives), and celestial,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_7:0.0000:but the second and third together get ofily three lines. The first
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_8:0.0000:kind is personified as a very powerful being, conquering nobles,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_9:0.0000:princes, and kings. Not Reason but Impulse rules her court, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_10:0.0000:never will justice be done there. So subtle is she that no man can
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_11:0.0000:see her ; so swiftly she runs that none can escape ; so straight she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_12:0.0000:strikes that none can guard by hauberk however stout against the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_13:0.0000:dart of steel with which she gives the " colp de plazer," against the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_14:0.0000:golden arrows which she shoots from her bow, or against her finely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_15:0.0000:sharpened dart of lead. She wears a crown of gold. Though she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_16:0.0000:sees nothing, yet where she wishes to strike she never misses. She
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_17:0.0000:Hies lightly and is much feared. When she does evil it seems as if it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_18:0.0000:were good. Descent or wealth she does not regard.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_19:0.0250:She dwells in a palace with five portals, two of which having been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_20:0.0000:passed, the other three are easy of entrance ; but the exit is hard.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_21:0.0000:Whoever can remain there lives in joy. The entrance is at the top
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_22:0.0000:of four very, smooth steps, which no villain can climb. Those who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_23:0.0000:fail to ascend are lodged without in the " barri," which holds more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_24:0.0000:than half the world. Outside there is a stone seat where one may
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_25:0.0000:sit and play on a board any game one pleases ; but the play is not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_26:0.0000:without risks.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_30:0.0250:wrote a commentary on this poem which Dammann thinks is the only thing of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_31:0.0250:iU kind preserved. Dammann's book contains a collection of valuable material
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0034_32:0.0500:to which I owe some suggestions.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_22:0.0000:Homeric Hymn to Venus, which attributes to her power over even
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_23:0.0000:the gods, except Diana, Minerva, and Vesta. At the 'other extreme
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_24:0.0000:of our period, this omnipotence forms the chief theme of the happy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_25:0.0000:lovers' praise of Venus in the English Court of Love. The arrows
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_26:0.0250:are, of course, also a classical tradition ; but the division of them
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_27:0.0000:and of the darts according to material, steel, gold, and lead, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_28:0.0000:peculiar. Two classes we shall find frequently in Old French; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_29:0.0000:the " Golden Love " and " Leaden Love " that enter the Court just
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_30:0.0000:where one of the breaks in the Court of Love occurs are doubtless
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_31:0.0000:of a similar signification. What that signification is we shall find
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0035_32:0.0000:explained in later poems. Of the Palace 2 we have already had

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_1:0.0000:trappings were rich with jewels. They were attended by a squire
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_2:0.0000:and a damsel whose long hair almost hid her from view. The poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_3:0.0000:offered them hospitality, and, as they seemed to prefer the open air,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_4:0.0000:he led them to a sequestered garden enclosed by a Jiedge of reeds,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_5:0.0000:shaded by laurels, and watered by a clear fountain. The lawn was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_6:0.0000:enamelled with fresh flowers, and the trees were full of birds singing.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_7:0.0000:The damsel spread a pavilion richly worked with gold, on which were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_8:0.0000:represented all sorts of animals and flowers. A thousand knights
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_9:0.0000:could stand in it without touching each other, and yet the d;:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_10:0.0000:carried it folded up in her purse. 1 After some conversation the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_11:0.0000:poet was informed that the knight is the God of Love, the lady
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_12:0.0000:Mercy, and the squire and damsel Loyalty and Modesty. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_13:0.0000:squire carried a bow of alborn with three arrows in his girdle, one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_14:0.0000:of gold, one of Poitou steel, one of lead. The last part of the poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_15:0.0000:is occupied with discussions of the origin and nature of love ; of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_16:0.0000:grounds which justify a man in putting away his wife, as the King
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_17:0.0000:of Navarre had just done, and of the reason why the God of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_18:0.0000:was leading Mercy and her attendants away from the court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_19:0.0000:Alphonso of Castile ; but as the MS. is not complete, not all the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_20:0.0250:answers to Peire's questions have come down to us.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_21:0.0000:The squire, and not the god, it should be noted, has the bow and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_22:0.0000:arrows. This was doubtless suggested by the custom of the squire's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_23:0.0000:carrying the knight's spear when no fighting was to be done ; but in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_24:0.0250:the poem the squire not only carries the bow but does the shooting.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_25:0.0000:The arrows, we are told, enter by the eyes and by the ears, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0037_26:0.0000:serve to unite, not to separate, hearts. Observe also the different

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_5:0.0500:The troubadours of the north of Italy who* imitated Provencal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_6:0.0000:models and used the Provencal language, have also contributed to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_7:0.0000:the growth of the Court of Love tradition. One of these, whose name
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_8:0.0000:is unknown, but whose nationality is betrayed by Italianisms in his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_9:0.0500:style, 4 has left, in a unique and imperfect MS., an extreme example
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_10:0.0000:of the metaphorical type of the House of Love. In the beginning
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_11:0.0000:of this Chastel d'Amors the speaker announces his intention of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_12:0.0250:building a noble castle. The high towers are to be hard-hearted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_13:0.0000:ladies, and no lady is to be admitted who loves unworthily, or who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_14:0.0000:is not or does not intend to be engaged in love. The gates of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_15:0.0250:speech are the entrances, and the courteous open the doors with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_16:0.0000:keys of prayer. Immediately inside are the houses where rings and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_17:0.0000:other love-tokens are sold. The next door is fastened by sweet private
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_18:0.0250:love-kisses, and this is the point where a stand must be made if the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_19:0.0000:fortress is not to be yielded. Inside all is sweetness and youth and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_20:0.0250:welcome, and up in the tower are secluded chambers for the secret
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_21:0.0000:joys of love. The butlers and the cooks " son tuit de ris e de joec
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_22:0.0000:et de parlar ses ennuec," and no fire is required but love, which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_23:0.0000:makes perpetual summer. No bargaining is permitted ; and mortal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_24:0.0000:war is waged against husbands and jealous persons. Slanderers are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_25:0.0250:constantly attacking the ladies, who defend themselves by shooting
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_26:0.0000:proverbs at them. Evasions are their bucklers, oaths their lances,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_27:0.0000:and they are able to lie with an air of truth. He who can get a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_28:0.0500:dwelling place in this castle can go there and live in safety, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0038_29:0.0500:need never fear to lose what he has gained.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_15:0.0000:The man was appealing to the God of Love against being condemned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_16:0.0000:unheard, when the voice of the God was heard saying that he had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_17:0.0250:already passed judgment on the case, but would recall his sentence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_18:0.0500:till he had listened to both sides.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_19:0.0000:The lady complained that the lover had brought shame on her by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_20:0.0000:babbling of the favors she had granted him. This the man denied,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_21:0.0000:accusing her of having listened too readily to slanderers. She next
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_22:0.0000:charged him with having attempted her honor, and he protested that,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_23:0.0000:though he had been carried away by her beauty, he had never thought
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_24:0.0000:of dishonoring her, but that she, by obeying Love's command, could,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_25:0.0250:without shame, have saved him from his suffering.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_26:0.0000:When the pleading was finished, the voice of Love was heard
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_27:0.0000:again saying that the lover was guiltless of babbling, but that he had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_28:0.0000:been wrong in being so immoderate in his striving, yet that he de-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_29:0.0000:served pardon on account of his sufferings while waiting for recon-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_30:0.0250:ciliation, and that he should continue in the lady's service and she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0039_31:0.0000:should reward his faithfulness. The sentence was executed.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_6:0.0000:century, formerly in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps. This time
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_7:0.0000:Love is a regular feudal over-lord, who one fine day in spring calls
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_8:0.0000:together his barons at his dwelling on the top of Parnassus. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_9:0.0000:barons are ten in number : Joi, Solatz, Ardiment, Cortesia, Bon' Espe-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_10:0.0000:ranza, Paor, Largueza, Domnei, Celament, and Dolsa Companhia.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_11:0.0000:To each of them in turn Love makes a speech, thanking him for his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_12:0.0000:services in the past and allotting new tasks for the furtherance of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_13:0.0000:lordship of Love. The background is the familiar one, with violets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_14:0.0000:and other flowers, a pleasance hedged in with laurels and pines,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_15:0.0000:fountains playing into golden basins, and a hundred fair damsels
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0040_16:0.0000:being kissed and embraced by their lovers. The door-keepers are

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_4:0.0000:identity of subject-matter : viz., the discussion of the comparative
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_5:0.0000:merits of clerks and knights as lovers. The existence and wide
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_6:0.0000:prevalence of this discussion throw a significant light upon the social
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_7:0.0250:situation, in reading which it must be remembered that all the i

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_13:0.0000:Waitz, its editor, as " soweit ich mich jetzt erinnere, von einer hand

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_18:0.0000:poem is one of remarkable interest in itself ; and is so important to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_19:0.0000:us as containing the earliest instances of certain features of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_20:0.0250:Court of Love genre which were soon to become traditional, that a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_21:0.0000:full account of its contents is justifiable.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_22:0.0500:On the Ides of April, an assembly of ladies [of religion] was held
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_23:0.0000:at Remiremont, where nothing but Love was discussed. For " pu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_24:0.0000:ellae amantes " it was held, and no men except a few honest clerks
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_25:0.0000:were admitted. The doorkeeper was that Sibilia who had been a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_26:0.0250:soldier of Venus from her tender years, and had without reluct
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0041_27:0.0000:done whatever Love commanded.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_1:0.0250:After this the "cardinalis domina" stood up in the midst and called
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_2:0.0000:for silence. She was becomingly dressed in a many-colored gown,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_3:0.0000:brighter than gems, more precious than gold, and hung with a thou-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_4:0.0000:sand flowers of May. This royal maid, the flower and glory of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_5:0.0000:world, eloquent and learned, announced that she had been sent by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_6:0.0000:the God of Love, at the suggestion of April and May, to inquire into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_7:0.0000:the lives of those who were present. Elisabet de Granges rose and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_8:0.0000:stated that they served Love as well as they could. " Nothing that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_9:0.0000:he wishes displeases us, and if we neglect anything, it is unwittingly.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_10:0.0000:Thus we choose to keep no regular bond with any man, nor do we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_11:0.0000:know any unless he be of our order." Elisabet de Falcon followed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_12:0.0000:and more distinctly declared that they Ibved the favor, praise, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_13:0.0000:memory of clerks, whose " rule " alone held them, and whom they
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_14:0.0000:knew to be "affabiles, gratos et amabiles." Clerks were co_urteous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_15:0.0000:and honorable, and knew not deceit or slander ; they had experience
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_16:0.0000:and diligence in loving. They gave beautiful gifts and kept agree-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_17:0.0000:ments well ; if they loved anything sweetly, they did not relinquish
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_18:0.0000:it lightly. The breaking of foolish vows was not mortal sin. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_19:0.0000:love of knights she declared detestable and unstable ; and, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_20:0.0000:confessing that once she and her sisters sought their notice, she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_21:0.0000:asserted that they soon discovered their guile and transferred them-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_22:0.0000:selves to the jolly clerks whose love was without vice, strong, firm,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_23:0.0000:and stable.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_24:0.0250:This view was approved by the lady cardinal; but a new speaker,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_25:0.0000:Elisabet Pompona, came forward on behalf of the knights " who go
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_26:0.0000:boldly to battle for our sakes, and to please us fear neither hard-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_27:0.0000:ships, wounds nor death. Such we choose, such we make ours:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_28:0.0000:their prosperity is our happiness, their sadness disturbs our joy."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_29:0.0000:"Such an occupation," continues one Adeleyt, "pleases me more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_30:0.0000:than the psalter. . . . Compared with this tie, I hold our rule
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_31:0.0000:light"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_33:0.0000:ourselves to the clerks and we will not change. . . . The whole country
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_34:0.0000:smiles with their mirth : they praise us in all kinds of verses. Such men
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_35:0.0000:do I love above all others, by the command of Venus." Knights are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_36:0.0000:blamed for levity and foolish talkativeness; they like to slander and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0042_37:0.0250:reveal secrets. " I have known the life and manners of all lovers. .
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_3:0.0000:Then the chief lady summed up, and decreed the expulsion of all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_4:0.0000:who did not disown the love of knights. Faithfulness to one lover,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_5:0.0000:under pain of heavy penance, was enjoined. Never must they give
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_6:0.0000:to vile knights " tactum vestri corporis, vel colli, vel femoris." 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_7:0.0000:ure taken with knights gave rise to scandal : clerks knew how to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_8:0.0000:arrange things and could keep secrets.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_9:0.0250:All responded in support of this decision and declared that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_10:0.0000:decrees should be announced through all the churches to the con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_11:0.0000:vent girls. An " Excommunicatio Rebellarum " was drawn up: "By
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_12:0.0000:the command of Venus, to you and others everywhere who yield to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_13:0.0000:the love of knights let there remain confusion, terror, contrition, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_14:0.0000:many other curses, unless you repent and are forgiven." " Ad con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_15:0.0000:firmacionem omnes dicimus Amen. . . . Militibus victis, cessit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_16:0.0000:victoria clero."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_19:0.0500:is April and May who suggest to the God of Love the sending of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_30:0.0000:sequent sections. The first, the placing of a Court of Love in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_31:0.0000:spring, hardly needs explanation. Finding its root in a natural phe-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_32:0.0000:nomenon, the association of love with the springtime is probably as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_33:0.0250:old as love poetry, and is constantly appearing, in the Pervigilium
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_34:0.0000:Veneris, in practically all mediaeval love allegories, down to the robin
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_35:0.0250:and the lapwing, the dove and the young man of the " Locksley Halls "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0043_36:0.0250:of our own time. The association of May ist with Venus, which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_1:0.0500:finds its finest expression in the Latin poem just mentioned, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_3:0.0250:of the same natural causes. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_4:0.0000:In the case of the fourth point, we may remark that though this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_5:0.0000:poem is not in a strict sense a Court of Venus or Cupid, yet the God
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_6:0.0000:of Love is represented by the Lady Cardinal in a fashion slightly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_7:0.0000:analogous to that of Alcestis in the Court of Love; and that her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_8:0.0000:dress, though not elaborately described, is of the same kind as is to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_9:0.0250:be found in the usual descriptions of the occupant of the throne of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_10:0.0000:Love. The figure throughout, however, is clearly taken rather from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_11:0.0000:the ecclesiastical than the feudal side of mediaeval life ; and this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_12:0.0000:ecclesiastical element continues to appear, alone or mixed with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_16:0.0250:the next poem on the " clerk v. knight " theme, and it also is in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_17:0.0000:Latin. The exact date of the poem, the name and even the nation-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_18:0.0000:ality of the writer, are unknown, though M. Geddon Huet 3 has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_19:0.0000:attempted to prove by parallelisms from the chansons de geste that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_20:0.0000:the author was a Frenchman. Its influence upon French poetry is,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0044_21:0.0000:however, sufficient justification for introducing it at this point.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0045_16:0.0000:merely driven to his strenuousness by poverty. Finally she appeals

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0045_20:0.0000:dise of Love, at the entrance of which murmurs a river, and the air
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0045_21:0.0500:is laden with sweet odors and the sounds of music.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_14:0.0500:Florance et Blanche/tor^ or Le Jugement d" Amour* is exactly the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_15:0.0000:same in plot as De Phyllide et Flora up to the point where the ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_16:0.0000:arrive at the palace of the God of Love. The description of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_17:0.0000:dwelling is here much more elaborate, and we have the beginnings of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_18:0.0000:a new type of palace, even more fantastic than the bejewelled man-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_19:0.0000:sion of the type of Ovid's palace of Apollo. The walls are not of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_20:0.0000:stone, but of roses and other flowers, and the grounds are fenced in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_21:0.0000:with Cupid's bows. No " vilain " can pass the gates : all must bear
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_22:0.0000:the seal of love. On arriving, the damsels dismount under a pine,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_23:0.0000:and two birds come down from the tree and lead them to the palace.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_24:0.0000:When the God of Love sees them he leaps from his bed, salutes them
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_25:0.0000:courteously, and, taking them by the hand, seats them beside himself
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_26:0.0000:and asks their needs. Blancheflor states the case, and the king [he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_27:0.0000:was a god a moment before] assembles his barons to decide the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_28:0.0000:question. When the court, which consists of birds, has assembled,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_29:0.0000:the king lays the question before them. The side of the knight is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_30:0.0000:taken by Sire Esperviers, Sire Faucons, and the Gais ; that of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0046_31:0.0500:clerk by Dame Kalandre, Dame Aloe, and the Rossignox. The jay

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_3:0.0000:claim, and the parrot accepts the challenge. After a fight in i

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_13:0.0250:The second Old French poem of this group is fragmentary, but so
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_14:0.0000:far as it is preserved it is very close to the foregoing. It is called
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_15:0.0000:Hueline et Aiglantine? from the names of the heroines. The particu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_16:0.0000:lar quality that each insists that her lover has most of is courtesy,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_17:0.0000:and the discussion almost takes the form of a tenson. They set off
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_18:0.0000:to seek an umpire and meet two bachelors, who direct them to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_19:0.0000:God of Love. Shortly after they come within a wall which no snow
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_20:0.0000:or rain or fire can pass, 2 and they see a palace built of flowers and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_21:0.0000:spices. They dismount by a tree in whose branches singing birds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0047_22:0.0000:"d'amors movent lo cenbel." Here the MS. breaks off.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_6:0.0000:The two Old French poems of this group that were written in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_7:0.0250:England are the Geste de Blancheflour et Florence? in which a king
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_8:0.0000:again presides and birds form the court, deciding the question by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_9:0.0000:combat in favor of the knight ; and Melior et Idoine? in which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_10:0.0000:scene is laid near Lincoln. Here there is no god of Love, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_11:0.0000:author himself overhears the damsels dispute as he is riding to Lin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_12:0.0250:coln. The appeal is simply to the birds and the verdict is in favor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_13:0.0000:of the clerk.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_14:0.0250:The Debate which forms the central motive of this group of poems
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_15:0.0000:is a literary form that we shall find frequently associated with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_16:0.0000:machinery of the Court of Venus. The more remote results of this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_17:0.0000:association will be discussed in the chapter on the Relation of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_18:0.0000:Allegory to the Institution of the Court of Love (chap, viii, below).

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_26:0.0000:personage in Florance et Blancheflor, which has been noted above, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_27:0.0250:suggestive of the process by which the classical divine court took on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_28:0.0000:a feudal character. The birds are just about to be brought in, not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0048_29:0.0500:merely as attendants on the God of Love, but as barons with delib-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_20:0.0000:gentius, Jerome, and Theodulfus on p. 22, above, is clear, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_21:0.0250:there is here an appropriate absence of the grave severity of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_23:0.0500:Of more significance than these is a poem 2 which is interesting
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_24:0.0000:because it seems to indicate that the allegorical machinery with which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_25:0.0000:we have become familiar in the poems lately described was already
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_26:0.0000:so well known as to allow of its becoming a medium for burlesque.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_27:0.0000:The poet, speaking in the first person, tells how he was a <;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_28:0.0000:" vino debachatus," at an inn beside the temple of Venus. From
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_29:0.0000:out of the doors of the " almum templum " came a sound of sweet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_30:0.0000:singing, from sirens, many thought, and going up to the porter,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_31:0.0000:"virgo nobilis, pulchra, statu brevi," he asked for admission. In
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_32:0.0000:answer to her questions he told her he was wounded with the arrow
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0049_33:0.0250:of Venus and sought a speedy cure. Venus summoned him to her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_7:0.0000:they found many beautiful creatures, all alike in nature and dress,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_8:0.0000:who rose in welcome and offered seats. But Venus said, "aliud
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_15:0.0000:the nature of the " templum," the author says that he and his com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_16:0.0000:panion went to bathe in a garden bath consecrated to Jove, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_17:0.0000:thence he emerged refreshed and hungry. A feast, chiefly of fowls,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_18:0.0000:was served, and he stayed till "a Venere sum nunc allevatus num-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_19:0.0000:mis." The poem ends with an admonition to young men to heed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_20:0.0000:his experience.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_22:0.0000:the arrow., the way in which the hero is led to the goddess, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_23:0.0000:throng of beautiful maidens all these point to a familiarity with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_24:0.0000:exactly that kind of allegory which we are studying. The cloak of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_25:0.0000:the double meaning falls off when the poem is about half finished,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_26:0.0000:and the second part is realistic rather than allegorical.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_27:0.0000:If the date of the poem were to be neglected, one might suggest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_28:0.0000:that the author had in mind rather the obscene rites that were in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_29:0.0000:tome cases observed in the worship of the earthly Aphrodite, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_30:0.0000:the practice of prostitution in connection with the temples of that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_31:0.0000:goddess in several cities, notably in Corinth ; but the knowledge of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_32:0.0250:antiquity current in the middle ages was not of such a nature as to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_33:0.0000:nuke this at all probable. If any general inference is to be drawn
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_34:0.0000:from this poem at all, it is more likely that, as has been said, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0050_35:0.0000:Court of Venus allegory was already familiar enough to give point to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_3:0.0250:Li Fablel dou Dieu d* Amours ' is, as Langlois makes out with con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_4:0.0250:siderable certainty, a somewhat clumsy imitation of some form of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_5:0.0250:story of which De Fhyllide et Flora is our earliest surviving example.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_6:0.0000:It gains a separate importance, however, from the greater elaboration
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_7:0.0000:of some features, and from the fact that it is probably the medium
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_8:0.0250:through which the preceding group influenced the Roman de la Rose.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_10:0.0250:that afterwards becomes almost the rule.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_11:0.0250:The author, who writes in the first person, had a vision that he-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_12:0.0000:was walking one bright May morning in a fair garden watered by a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_13:0.0000:clear brook and surrounded by a ditch and a marvellous wall within
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_14:0.0000:which no " vilain " was admitted. He seated himself under a tree
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_15:0.0000:with healing powers, and listened to the songs of the birds until he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_16:0.0000:almost thought himself in paradise. The nightingale called the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_17:0.0000:other birds round him, and complained of the degeneration of love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_18:0.0000:The hawk laid the blame on the "villaine gent," but the thrush
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_19:0.0000:objected to the hawk's confining love to clerks and knights. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_20:0.0250:jay, too, was democratic, and thought that to love and be well loved
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_21:0.0000:was to be as worthy and wise as a clerk. The nightingale agreed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_22:0.0000:and dismissed the assembly, leaving the lover lying delightless under
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_23:0.0250:the tree.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_24:0.0500:From this dream the lover fell into another. He saw approach-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_25:0.0000:ing a maiden, whom he recognized as his lady. They met with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_26:0.0000:affectionate embraces; but in the midst of their talk a di
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_27:0.0000:descended and carried her off, leaving him lamenting and declaring
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_28:0.0000:the folly of serving the God of Love. Just then the god himself
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_29:0.0000:came riding up, and, after some conversation, promised succor. He
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_30:0.0000:carried off the lover to his palace, Champ Fieuri, leaving him here
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_31:0.0000:while he went to hunt the dragon. In the description of the palace
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_32:0.0000:the metaphorical element is carried one step farther than in Florance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0051_33:0.0500:et Blancheflor. The ditches were of sighs, the water was lovers' tears
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_1:0.0250:and so on. The gate was guarded by the Phoenix. The hero
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_2:0.0500:entered and found the palace supported by pillars representing the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_3:0.0250:Months. The hall was filled with youths and maidens playing chess
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_5:0.0000:h he acknowledged by singing a love-song. Then a girl took
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_6:0.0250:him by the hand to show him the glories of the mansion, and they
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_7:0.0250:d the chamber of the god, where hung two quivers, one with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_19:0.0500:DE VENUS LA DEESSE D'AMOR.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_21:0.0000:another poem, which, though changing many details and modifying
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_22:0.0000:the plot, is yet manifestly founded on it. De Venus la Deesst
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_23:0.0000:<TAmor l is written in the third person, but otherwise follows the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_24:0.0000:model closely till we come to the dispute among the birds. When
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_25:0.0000:the nightingale is describing the symptoms of lovers, 2 the hero
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_26:0.0000:exclaims that he is such a man, and frightens the bird away. Here a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_27:0.0000:gap in the text occurs, and this is followed by a long lament on the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_28:0.0000:miseries of the lover, whose lady is absent. After this appears the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_29:0.0000:Goddess of Love attended by three damsels, all riding on mules.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_30:0.0000:The birds, who have returned, now proclaim the lover's distress and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0052_31:0.0000:get the goddess to promise her assistance. After inquiries concern-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_1:0.0250:where they are admitted on showing the seal of love. Venus is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_2:0.0500:warmly welcomed ; and, going to the god's chamber, they find him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_3:0.0000:on a bed of flowers. He rises, and embraces and makes much of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_4:0.0250:goddess. The hall is described : roses and other flowers are every-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_5:0.0000:where ; the door is of coral, the building itself of crystal, the I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_6:0.0000:" qui enclot le palais sont lermes de pities." Then a girl acts as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_7:0.0250:guide, as in the model, and the lover sees the chamber, the arrows,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_8:0.0000:and the tomb. When they return to the palace, ten maidens hrin^
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_9:0.0000:in a bier with the body of a true lover, which is given a rich funer.il.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_10:0.0000:Now the goddess leads the hero before the God of Love, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_11:0.0000:embraces her and seats her beside him, while the true languishing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_12:0.0000:lover kneels before them. A prince sounds a golden "sifflet" ami
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_13:0.0000:calls for silence. The goddess rises and makes a plea for the lover,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_14:0.0000:and the god grants her what she seeks, and his seal. The nightin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_15:0.0250:gale offers to devise the charter, and gets the commission. This
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_16:0.0000:charter orders the lady to return the passion of the loyal lover on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_17:0.0250:pain of fearful vengeance. But when the lover, having taken leave
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_18:0.0250:of the Court, and having come to his lady, presents it, she yields at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_19:0.0250:once, and the poem ends.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_21:0.0250:special chapters ; but at present we may note the extending use of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_22:0.0000:birds and flowers, the persistence of the two kinds of arrows and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_23:0.0000:of the guide, and the growing distinctness of the picture of a feudal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_24:0.0000:court in its double aspect of a social and a legal institution. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_25:0.0000:courts of the feudal lords were, of course, not only the social centres
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_26:0.0000:of their territories, but were also the places where justice was admin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_27:0.0000:isteredj and even in De Phyllide et Flora this double function is indi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_28:0.0000:cated. On the arrival of the hero or heroine, the lord and his retinue
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_29:0.0000:are usually found enjoying themselves ; but they are always ready
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_30:0.0000:for business when a case turns up, the decision sometimes lying with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_31:0.0000:the lord himself, as in De Venus la Deesse, sometimes being handed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_32:0.0000:over to his barons, as in the Altercatio. In the poem just outlined it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0053_33:0.0250:is to be remarked that the god is not called Cupid, and that he seems

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_9:0.0000:for the god; the other three are used by three classes of ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_10:0.0000:respectively. The ladies of the south door are always dallying about
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_11:0.0000:the threshold, the door being kept open. Those of the west perpetu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_12:0.0000:ally wander beyond the entrance. Those of the north stay within
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_13:0.0000:dosed doors and never look beyond the limits of the palace.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_24:0.0000:This description is given by a knight to a lady whom he wishes to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_25:0.0000:frighten out of her coldness, and it is reinforced by the account which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_26:0.0000:follows of a procession of the inmates of this palace. In his vision,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_27:0.0000:the speaker says, he saw a procession led by a man crowned with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_28:0.0000:golden diadem and riding a beautiful horse. He was followed, first,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_29:0.0000:by a great troop of women gorgeously arrayed and each seated " in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_30:0.0000:equo pinguissimo et formoso." A knight was in attendance on each
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_31:0.0000:fide, and a third led the horse by the bridle. The second troop of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_32:0.0000:women were also attended, but were in great discomfort through the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0056_33:0.0000:noise and confusion of the many who wished to wait on them. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_4:0.0250:deus est amoris, qui singulis septimanis una die praesenti cernitur adiunctis

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_8:0.0000:follows the procession to a beautiful meadow surrounded by " pomif-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_9:0.0000:erous and odoriferous " trees, and divided by concentric circles into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_10:0.0000:three parts. In the centre of the innermost circle stood a wonderful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_11:0.0000:tree bearing all kinds of fruits, and having at its root a fountain of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_12:0.0000:nectar in which all kinds of fishes swam. Beside the tree,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_16:0.0250:At her right hand stood another gorgeous seat, empty. The streams
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_17:0.0000:from the central fountain pleasantly watered the first part, but flooded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_18:0.0000:the second, which was called " humiditas," and the water there became
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_19:0.0000:very cold, though overhead the sun blazed and there was no tree to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_20:0.0000:shelter. The third zone was called " siccitas " : there everything
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_21:0.0000:was arid, and the air was full of fiery vapors as from a red-hot fur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_22:0.0000:nace. All about lay bundles of thorns with a log through the midst
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_23:0.0000:of each, and a strong man stood at each end of the log. But through
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_24:0.0000:the third and second regions a pleasant road led to the centre,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_25:0.0250:encumbered with none of these things.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_26:0.0250:Now the King of Love entered and, after embracing the Queen,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_27:0.0000:took his seat on the vacant throne. The three bands followed and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_28:0.0000:took possession of their respective regions, the members of the third
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_29:0.0000:being forced to sit on the bundles of thorns while the men in attend-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_30:0.0000:ance kept the axles in motion. The knight now asked leave to go;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_31:0.0000:but his guide sent him before the God of Love, and instructed him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_32:0.0000:to pay great attention and not to forget to pray for her. So to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_33:0.0000:god he went and sought mercy and advice, and favor for his guide.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_34:0.0000:The deity instructed him to use this vision for the salvation of all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0057_35:0.0000:such women as he should find resisting love: enumerated the twelve
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_5:0.0250:costumes, and the guide. Since in date Andreas probably comes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_6:0.0250:betw :bUldou DUu a" Amours and De Vem% la Deesse d'Amor,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_7:0.0250:it is worth noting that the relation of the God and the Goddess is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_8:0.0000:same in Andreas as in the second of the two poems, neither of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_9:0.0250:the names Cupid or Venus being used in the prose work. Again,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_10:0.0250:though in the scene in the meadow of the Paradise of Love the God
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_11:0.0000:and the Goddess are called King and Queen, the whole conception
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_12:0.0000:here is borrowed from the religious rather than the feudal world ; the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_13:0.0000:rewards and punishments are not such as a sovereign might inflict,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_14:0.0000:but are an adaptation of the theological conceptions of paradise, pur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_15:0.0000:gatory, and hell. It is important also to remember that all this was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_16:0.0000:written a century before the Divine Comedy. Observe, too, that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_17:0.0250:palace and the meadow scene are quite separate.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_23:0.0500:In the army of Christ, made up of Virtues and their followers,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_24:0.0250:comes Love, riding with Prowess, Courtesy, and Largess. They are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_25:0.0250:arming Love with a shield painted with flowers and adorned with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0058_32:0.0500:of amorous darts, furnished with feathers which Love had bound to

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_1:0.0500:to be wounded with such an arrow, so that the point should n
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_2:0.0500:in his heart, for it is called " douz anemis," and no heart is proud
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_3:0.0500:enough to resist its force and refrain from becoming "doi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_11:0.0250:When the battle is joined, Virginity and Chastity are found mak-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_12:0.0000:ing successful war against Fornication and Adultery, but Cupid and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_13:0.0000:Venus come to the aid of the latter. Cupid draws his bow and (
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_14:0.0250:tity turns in flight. Venus holds the bow of Temptation which Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_15:0.0000:has strung with the tresses of damsels, and shoots with a barbed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_16:0.0000:arrow at Virginity. The poet himself is struck to the heart with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_17:0.0000:this arrow, and he stretches himself on the grass while Bras-de-Fer
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_18:0.0000:comforts him. Esperance holds his head, and they begin to work
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_19:0.0000:necromancy on him without avail. So much is he grieved with Des-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_20:0.0000:perance that he swoons and sees a vision of Venus and a great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_21:0.0000:procession of goddesses coming to help him in his pain, a pain in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_22:0.0000:the heart worse than toothache, he says. Venus, Temptation, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_23:0.0000:Amor administer a potion in a silver phial which he drains at one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_24:0.0000:draught, with such effect that if Esperance had not put a plaster of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_25:0.0000:good hope on his left side his soul would have been drawn out of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_26:0.0000:body. But now his spirit returns and he calls for justice. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_27:0.0000:judge acquits Venus and puts the blame on his eyes, the porters of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_28:0.0000:the castle, who left the gate open. The eyes protest, Reason replies,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_29:0.0250:and all approve. Virginity, Chastity, and their followers are put to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_30:0.0000:flight. In the long run, the Vices are overthrown.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_31:0.0000:In this passage Love, of course, instead of being the supreme
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_32:0.0000:power, is only one of the abstractions taking part in the tournament,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_33:0.0000:so that it is not so absurd to find Venus herself complained of before
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_34:0.0000:a judge. But the whole matter is very much confused. Love is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_35:0.0000:introduced on the side of Christ, and in excellent company, his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_36:0.0000:attendants Prowess, Courtesy, and Largess being the regular knightly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0059_37:0.0250:virtues which are so constantly insisted on in the Statutes. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_2:0.0000:^ct when the fighting once begins Love is on the side of the Vices.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_3:0.0000:This confusion is really the result of the influence of the two classes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_4:0.0250:of models which Huon de Mery had before him. On the one hand
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_5:0.0000:was the growing mass of literature in praise of Love which we are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_6:0.0000:particularly studying ; on the other was the didacfic allegory with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_7:0.0250:purely moral and religious aim, and a tendency to treat love from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_8:0.0000:the ascetic point of view. When Love comes riding in, Huon is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_9:0.0000:thinking of the favorable representations ; but when the fight begins
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_10:0.0000:he falls into the clerical attitude and naturally enough ranges him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_11:0.0000:against Virginity and Chastity. The confusion is interesting as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_12:0.0250:being another instance of the two tendencies in this allegorizing of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0060_13:0.0250:love, the feudal and the religious.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_11:0.0000:The Roman dc la Rose is so compendious that there are few motives
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_12:0.0000:of any importance in the class of poems we are here concerned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_13:0.0250:with, which are not found represented in it ; and its influence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_14:0.0000:so extensive and so profound that there are few of these poems in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_15:0.0000:the two or three centuries following which do not give evidence of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_16:0.0000:their authors' acquaintance with it. Yet M. Langlois is undoubtedly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_17:0.0000:right when he points out * the error of supposing that the authors of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_18:0.0000:the Roman are responsible for the prodigious predominance of alle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_19:0.0000:gory in the imaginative work of the succeeding centuries. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_20:0.0000:appearance of a masterpiece in any literary genre does undoubtedly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_21:0.0000:lead to a more extensive cultivation of that genre by the great crowd
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_22:0.0000:of minor authors ; and in this way Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_23:0.0000:Meun must bear their share of the blame, if blame it must be called,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_24:0.0000:of making allegory so universal in France and the countries under
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_25:0.0000:her literary influence from 1250 to 1550. But we have already pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_26:0.0000:duced sufficient instances of exactly the kind of thing of which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_27:0.0000:Roman de la Rose is the supreme example to show that allegory was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_28:0.0000:an increasingly favorite form before Guillaume began his poem, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_29:0.0000:to justify the assumption that it would have been more and more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_30:0.0250:extensively employed though he had never lived. It does not require
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_31:0.0000:a very profound knowledge of the working of the mediaeval mind to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0061_32:0.0250:feel that in this elaborating of double meanings and this classifying
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_3:0.0250:It will not be necessary for our present purpose to give a complete
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_4:0.0000:analysis of the 22,000 lines of the Roman de la Rose, since the poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_5:0.0000:itself is much better known than most of those with which we have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_6:0.0000:to deal, and since such an analysis is easily accessible. 1 Our ends
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_7:0.0000:will be sufficiently served if we select those features which find a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_8:0.0500:parallel in the English Court of Love or to any large extent in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_9:0.0000:other poems of its class.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_12:0.0500:knowledge of Macrobius's commentary on the Somnium Scipionis of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_18:0.0500:II. The description of a May morning at the opening of the poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_19:0.0500:is already a tradition of long descent, and has been commented on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_20:0.0500:above (pp. 33-4). The Roman, however, has much more detail here,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_23:0.0250:III. The placing of the Court in a meadow surrounded by fine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_24:0.0000:trees, with streams and fountains, with abundance of all kinds of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_25:0.0000:flowers, and with birds singing all this had already become familiar,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_26:0.0000:though here, too, the generous scale of the poem allowed a great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_27:0.0000:deal of detail. The Court of Love uses the flowers in describing the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_28:0.0000:decoration of the palace, and the birds in the litany at the end, but,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_29:0.0250:except in the reference to the gathering of hawthorn by the court in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_30:0.0000:the last few stanzas, the action is all in-doors.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_32:0.0000:mediaeval fashion of decorating with some kind of fresco instead of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0062_33:0.0250:tapestry. The house of Nature in the Anticlaudianus has portraits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_3:0.0250:V. The porter Idleness is nnother point probably suggested by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_4:0.0500:common usage. In ballads and romances the porter is a frequent
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_5:0.0250:and often an important figure, and the least original poet <i
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_6:0.0000:an allegorical castle might be expected to furnish a representative.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_7:0.0000:Thus little stress need be laid on the presence of a porter in the prede-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_8:0.0000:cessors of the Roman, and just as little upon Idleness here as sug-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_9:0.0000:gesting later instances. Yet it may be worth noting in passing that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_10:0.0250:Chaucer has what seems like a direct allusion to this particular
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_11:0.0500:porter :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_16:0.0000:courtiers has already been discussed in some detail, and further
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_17:0.0000:instances have appeared in nearly all the poems analyzed. But here
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_18:0.0000:again this device receives a great expansion, and several new crea-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_19:0.0000:tions, henceforth to be indispensable, appear for the first time. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_20:0.0000:figures appearing both in the Roman de la Rose and in the Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_21:0.0000:-Loveaxe these : Daunger (probably original with Guillaume de Lo:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_22:0.0000:Shame, Pity, Delight, Hope, Envy, Despair, Lust, and the goddesses
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_23:0.0000:Venus and Fortune. Some qualities that appear in the Roman as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_24:0.0000:persons (e.g., Bien-Celer, Hardement, and Seiirte', the Warriors of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_25:0.0000:Love) become Statutes in the Court of Love. Other characters (not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_26:0.0000:occurring in the English poem) which were probably first put into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_27:0.0000:circulation by the Roman are Bel Acueil, Male Bouche, Deduit, Dous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_28:0.0250:Regart, Dous Penser, 2 and Dous Parler. In all, the French poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_29:0.0000:has about fifty of these personifications.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_30:0.0250:VII. The Fountain of Love, into which no one can look without
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0063_31:0.0250:falling in love, and which is here specially associated with the Nar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_2:0.0000:meadow in which the courtiers of Love disport themselves ; and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_3:0.0000:Narcissus story would suggest the fatal quality which is here made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_4:0.0000:of general application. The magic fountain of the romances and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_5:0.0000:fairy stories may also have contributed. The motive is frequent in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_6:0.0250:the later poets, and in one or two cases becomef central. It does
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_7:0.0250:not occur in the Court of Love. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_8:0.0250:VIII. The arrows of Cupid are more elaborately treated than
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_9:0.0000:hitherto. The idea of two kinds of arrows Langlois traces to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_11:0.0000:an indication of some similar idea we have seen in the passage in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_12:0.0000:the DC Nuptiis Honorii et Mariae of Claudian, where in the abode of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_13:0.0000:Venus in Cyprus are two fountains, one sweet and one bitter, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_14:0.0000:which Cupid's arrows are dipped. In Guiraut de Calanso we had the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_15:0.0000:same idea: in his A Ids cui am de cor there were three metals, steel,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_16:0.0000:gold, and lead, and in his Sapchas a" Amor two, gold and steel. But
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_17:0.0000:the earliest instance is probably that noted by Professor Skeat 2 from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_23:0.0500:Guillaume de Lorris keeps this twofold division of the arrows, but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_24:0.0000:he puts five in each quiver and gives each arrow a name. The good
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_25:0.0000:arrows are Beaute\ Simplesse, Franchise, Compagnie, and Beau Sem-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_26:0.0000:blant (Cortoisie is added in the second enumeration, v. 1775) ; the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_27:0.0000:second quiver contains Orgueil, Vilenie, Honte, Desesperance, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_28:0.0250:Nouveau Penser. The god shoots the hero with each of the five
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_29:0.0000:good arrows in turn.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_30:0.0250:It seems more than likely that the Golden Love and Leaden Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_31:0.0500:of the English Court of Love are derived from this fiction of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_32:0.0250:arrows, but how the poet meant to treat them must remain uncertain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0064_33:0.0500:until we find a complete text of the poem.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_12:0.0000:garden in which it takes place is not as in the other poems the prop-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_13:0.0000:erty of Love, but of Deduit ; and that the hero, instead of being led
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_14:0.0250:up to a throne on which the god is seated in state, is followed by the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_15:0.0500:god, who shoots arrows at him, and finally accosts him.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_27:0.0000:have had examples covering the time from Prudentius and the church
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_28:0.0000:fathers down to the Tornoiement a" Antichrist. There is, however,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_29:0.0000:nothing of this in the Court of Love, so that to trace it farther does
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0065_30:0.0500:not lie within our present scope.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_3:0.0000:Ros* and belonging to the same century, is the Roman de la Poire 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_4:0.0000:of a certain Messire Thibaut. The poem gets its name, which seems
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_5:0.0000:to be suggested by that of the Roman de la Ros+ from a pear which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_6:0.0000:the heroine eats as she sits by the poet's side under a pear tree in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_7:0.0250:a beautiful garden. She shares it with the poet, on whom it works
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_8:0.0500:like magic, setting him on fire with love in a moment.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_9:0.0000:But this is not told at the beginning. The poem opens with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_10:0.0000:statement in eight-syllabled verses that Love has passed on the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_11:0.0000:a sentence that can be recalled only by the lady for whom he writes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_12:0.0000:the romance. Then follow twelve sections of five stanzas each, not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_13:0.0250:organically connected with the Romance, but of some individual
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_24:0.0000:In the fourth Thibaut speaks of his mistress and himself; in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_25:0.0000:fifth, sixth, and seventh, Tristan tells of his love for Yseut, introduc-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_26:0.0000:ing the incident where Mark finds the lovers in the forest, and leaves
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_27:0.0000:his glove to shade Yseut's face from the sun. The eighth has the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_28:0.0000:story of Pyramis and Thisbe, the ninth the arming for a tournament,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0066_29:0.0000:and the tenth the tournament itself, an allegory on a small scale,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_17:0.0500:The eleventh section is devoted to Paris and Helen, and, after an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_18:0.0500:unimportant passage, the twelfth follows with a dedication to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_19:0.0000:mistress. At v. 284, the introduction to the romance proper b<
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_22:0.0500:The poet is besieged by Love in a tower, and is hopelessly hem:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_23:0.0000:in Jby the forces of the god. Biaute', Cortoisie, Noblece, and Fran-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_24:0.0000:chise appear to treat with him, and each makes a speech. While
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_25:0.0250:they are still engaged in parley the god himself rides up, heralded by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_26:0.0000:the singing of birds and the noise of many instruments, with ** jon-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_27:0.0000:gleurs " playing on fiddles and singing " chansons noveles." The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_28:0.0000:god himself now summons him to surrender without delay, and th<-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_29:0.0000:poet is so frightened that he surrenders at once, and swears a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_30:0.0000:ance. Love takes his heart as a pledge of good faith, and del
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_31:0.0250:a harangue on degenerate and false lovers. Then all go to Paris,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_32:0.0250:which is praised as the home of all pleasant delights, and Douz
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0067_33:0.0500:Regart is sent to entrust the poet's heart to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_1:0.0250:The lady's charms are described at great length ; but her position is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_2:0.0000:too lofty for him to cherish any hopes. He longs for death, since
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_3:0.0000:success in love is hopeless, and all night he tosses sleepless because
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_4:0.0000:of her. Reason comes and argues with him on the hopelessness of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_5:0.0000:his desires, and advises him to choose a place for his affections where
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_6:0.0000:the case will not be so desperate. Finally he determines to send a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_7:0.0000:messenger to declare his love, and this romance is to be the means.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_8:0.0000:Just then Love appears, leading the lady with him. He tells the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_9:0.0000:poet to take her by the hand, and says she is to free him from the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_10:0.0000:prison. But soon he leads the lady away again, and shoots her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_11:0.0000:through the heart with a golden-pointed arrow. Then he calls Con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_12:0.0000:tenence to him, and sends her to the poet to give him the lady's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_13:0.0000:heart in exchange for his own. Contenence is accompanied by Sos-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_14:0.0000:tix Pensse'e, Simplece, Leautez, Mensure, and Pitiez, who assure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_15:0.0000:him of his good fortune. But he must have a confirmation direct
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_16:0.0000:from his lady before he is at ease ; so the messengers return to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_17:0.0250:lady, and come back with a written message. He is to take his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_18:0.0000:name (Tibaut) and read it backward, reversing the , and the Latin
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_19:0.0000:that results (tua sit) ! will show that the lady is his. Left alone with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_20:0.0000:his lady's heart he asks it how he may comfort her, since she also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_21:0.0000:is suffering the pangs of love. Not daring to go to her alone, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_22:0.0000:( appeals to Love to give him "tres bon conduit," and the god sends a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_23:0.0250:1 nightingale to accompany him. The nightingale goes, but the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_24:0.0500:accompanies it only in spirit, and the lady receives the bird which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_25:0.0250:represents the romance with great joy.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_26:0.0500:if Stehlich is right in his estimate of the date of this poem, it is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_27:0.0250:probably the first important work inspired by the Roman de la Rose.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_28:0.0000:The points of likeness are obvious enough. The god seeks the lover
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_29:0.0000:in both cases, but in the second poem the names of some of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_30:0.0000:arrows appear among those of the ambassadors. The lover yields
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_31:0.0000:and becomes the vassal of Amor in both cases, but in the latter the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0068_32:0.0500:takinp of the poet's heart in pledge is used instead of locking it with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_1:0.0000:a key. The pains of love are described in much the same fashion
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_2:0.0250:in the two poems. Reason appears and argues with the hem a:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_3:0.0000:his passion in both. The followers of Love are in -part the I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_4:0.0000:and the descriptions of feminine beauty an- closely similar a point
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_5:0.0500:of more value as evidence in the thirteenth than in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_16:0.0250:In his Salu d* Amours ! we have a treatment of our theme some-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_17:0.0000:what more original than that which is found in the poems of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_18:0.0000:most of his contemporaries. In the form of a letter, Philippe prom-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_19:0.0000:ises to tell his lady how Dame Amour has stolen his heart, put it in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_20:0.0000:prison, and set her on guard ; and he prays her to remit to him the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_21:0.0500:ten penalties which have been inflicted on him. This was how it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_22:0.0000:happened :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_23:0.0250:One day at a dance Philippe feels himself wounded through the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_24:0.0000:eye by Love with an arrow which reaches his heart. This arrow
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_25:0.0250:figures the lady's beauty : the feather is her head, and the iron is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_26:0.0000:her glance. Amour sends Orguel, Cointise, and Traison to summon
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_27:0.0000:him to surrender, and he allows himself to be led before Amour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_28:0.0000:without resisting. Orguel accuses him of having taken the lady by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_29:0.0000:the finger. Amout promises him just judgment, and meanwhile he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_30:0.0000:leaves his heart in pledge. He is thrown into a prison called Pense'e,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_31:0.0000:and guarded by the gaoler Espoir. Amour calls her vassals to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_32:0.0000:trial, but unfortunately only the bad ones are free to come Orguel,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0069_33:0.0000:Cointise, Envie, Felonie, Mesdis, and Traison. Loiaute' sends his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0070_2:0.0500:1 r. 1 1 son draws up the judgment, which imposes ten penalties. 1

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_1:0.0500:may be drawn from the Prologue to his Dit du Vergier. Here a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_2:0.0250:dialogue takes place between Nature, Love, and the author. Nature-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_3:0.0000:tells him that she created him to sing of Love, and gives him the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_4:0.0000:assistance of three of her children, Scens, Retorique, and Musique.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_5:0.0000:Love comes to him and puts at his disposal three of her children,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_6:0.0000:Doux Penser, Plaisance, and Esperance, and commends to li
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_7:0.0250:the honor of ladies. His other poems lead one to believe that lie-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_8:0.0000:faithfully lived up to his instructions.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_9:0.0500:In the Dit du Vergier the poet represents himself as walking in a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_10:0.0000:garden one April morning. A path leads him to a beautiful orchard,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_11:0.0000:full of trees, flowers, and singing birds. Lost in amorous reverie,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_12:0.0250:he passes through the orchard into a meadow, where he has a vision.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_26:0.0250:This is the God of Love. All the youths and maidens are honor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_27:0.0000:ing him as their sovereign lord and their god. He explains to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_28:0.0000:poet the extent of his powers in making the foolish wise and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_29:0.0000:wise foolish, the poor rich and so on, declares his name, tells why
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_30:0.0000:he is blind, explains the use of his arrows in causing the sweet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_31:0.0000:pains of love, the use of his torch in inflaming desire, and the use
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_32:0.0000:of his wings in flying all over the world. The names of the youths
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_33:0.0000:in attendance are Voloir, Doux Penser, Doux Plaisir, Loiaute', Celer,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_34:0.0000:Desir ; of the damsels, Grace, Pitie', Esperance, Souvenir, Franchise,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0071_35:0.0250:Atemprance. The functions of these are explained, and the names
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_6:0.0000:On the second of April, when the hawthorl? blooms, the poet,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_7:0.0000:awakened by the song of birds, goes into the country to breathe the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_8:0.0000:spring air, and finds a delicious garden in an island to which he is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_9:0.0000:borne in a beautiful boat. He is met by a lion and conducted to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_10:0.0000:a rich pavilion, in which he finds a beautiful and noble lady. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_11:0.0000:poet, encouraged by his reception, asks where he is, and at the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_12:0.0000:request of the queen one of her knights replies. Formerly this was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_13:0.0000:not an isle, but only the rendezvous of all the lovers of the country
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_14:0.0000:(who are described in classes). The lord of the place wished to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_15:0.0000:exclude those who profaned it, so he surrounded it with water and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_16:0.0500:named it "1'espe'rance des fines amours." Only loyal and faithful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_17:0.0000:lovers now can enter : all others would lose their lives there.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_18:0.0000:Le Dit de la Fontaine Amoureuse, or Le Livre Morpheus, is inter-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_19:0.0000:esting not only on account of the direct influence of the Roman de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_20:0.0000:la Rose which it shows in the association of the fountain with Nar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_21:0.0000:cissus, but also because of the hints which Chaucer received from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_22:0.0000:it for The Bok of the Duchesse. The relation of Machaut to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_23:0.0000:love-lorn prince,* as well as the introduction of the story of Ceyx
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_24:0.0000:and Alcyone, is clearly paralleled by the English poet. 3 The part of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0072_25:0.0000:the poem which is important for our present purpose is as follows :

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_4:0.0000:for a shepherd. Thirty love problems arc dealt with, such as, e.g.,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_5:0.0250:that put by a "bacheler" who asks if it be possible to love loyally
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_6:0.0500:against one's own will, and receives an answer in the nega:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_7:0.0000:after eight days spent in these discussions the bailli puts under the

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_14:0.0000:Envy is reigning in the Castle of Love, and is persecuting all true
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_15:0.0000:lovers, who regret the passing away of the old regime. The wicked
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_16:0.0000:are encouraged, and when rascals like the servant who betrayed his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_17:0.0000:master's confidence and violated his wife, tell of their exploits, Envy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_18:0.0000:laughs and applauds. The author of our poem leaves the castle
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_19:0.0000:in disgust and seeks the " Roi de Frise." This king, grateful to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_20:0.0000:bailli for helping him to win the shepherdess, collects his barons and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_21:0.0500:makes an assault on the castle, and finally Envy is called upon to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_22:0.0250:yield it again into the hands of the bailli and his court.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_23:0.0000:We have to note here the substitution of the "grand Bailli" for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_24:0.0000:the God or Goddess of Love; the occurrence of \\iQpastourelle situa-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_25:0.0000:tion in the episode of the King of Frise ; and the predominance of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_26:0.0000:the legal aspect of the Court of Love. So far, we have had no case
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_27:0.0000:in which the forces of the enemy so clearly organized themselves
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_28:0.0000:into a Court of Envy, of which the courtiers were " fe'lons d'amour,"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_29:0.0000:and in which all the laws of Love were reversed. This is, of course,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_30:0.0500:just the kind of elaboration to be looked for as the conception of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0075_31:0.0500:the Court becomes more and more familiar.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_2:0.0500:Li Prisons </' 'Amours ' of the elder de Condd is a long and tedious
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_3:0.0000:allegorical poem, describing, with frequent digressions, the Prison of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_4:0.0000:Love, the way in which one gets into it, the torments of the pris-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_5:0.0000:oners, and five methods of escape. Though this work belongs to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_6:0.0000:general class of love-allegory, it contains little that is quite in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_7:0.0000:line of tradition which we are tracing. In the description of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_8:0.0000:the foundations of the Prison d'Amour we have, however, another
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_9:0.0000:instance of allegorical building materials (cf. p. 28, above). These
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0076_10:0.0250:foundations are of precious stones love-virtues :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_1:0.0250:JEAN hi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_5:0.0000:Lying asleep one night in May, the author dreamt that h<
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_6:0.0000:under a pine in a beautiful forest, and just before dawn heard the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_7:0.0000:birds singing overhead. Kpapegai came flying as a messenger from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_8:0.0000:the Goddess of Love, announcing her approach and calling on all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_9:0.0000:the birds to prepare a joyous welcome. The tidings were received
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_10:0.0000:with a more than earthly chorus of joy. A gorgeous throne wa
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_11:0.0000:up, and here Venus took her seat to dispense justice and receive
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_12:0.0000:adoration. The weather was fine, and the meadows were beautiful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_13:0.0000:with flowers and with clear brooks "courans sour menue graviele."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_14:0.0000:Many complaints were brought before Venus, but she postponed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_15:0.0000:everything till she should have dined, first giving orders that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_16:0.0000:nightingales should sing mass before her (devant //').
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_17:0.0250:A detailed account 3 of the service follows, with a sermon by the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_18:0.0250:parrot on the four virtues of lovers, 4 Obedience, Patience, Loyalty,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_22:0.0250:when an interruption occurred. The cuckoo, who had been driven
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_23:0.0000:away into the forest, thought he would have his revenge, and came
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_24:0.0000:flying over the heads of the kneeling lovers, shouting, u Tout cuku,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_25:0.0000:tout cuku ! " This made everybody very angry, and a great murmur
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_26:0.0000:arose. The sparrow-hawk gave chase, but the cuckoo hid in a hol-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_27:0.0000:low tree. Then service was resumed and finished, after which all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_28:0.0000:who loved "par amour " wished to go and put the cuckoo to death ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_29:0.0250:but Venus forbade them, telling them of its origin, and drawing les-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0077_30:0.0500:sons of warning against villany and slander.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_1:0.0250:round the throne of Venus, and each had what he wished. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_2:0.0000:courses consisted of glances, smiles, and the like, and a great chal-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_3:0.0000:ice was handed round, the contents of which only increased thirst.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_4:0.0000:There was an entremets of sighs and complaints. Some drank so
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_5:0.0000:much that they became excited; others fell asleep. Next came
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_6:0.0000:roasted ramprones with sauce of jealousy, and prSyers with sauce of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_7:0.0000:tears. Then were given to the ladies vessels filled with fair replies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_8:0.0000:and sweet favors, and the author knelt before one beautiful girl, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_9:0.0000:had a full dish, praying for a portion. A fair reply he got, but no
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_10:0.0000:Often he asked why she was so hard as to let him die of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_16:0.0250:Yet intoxication was no disgrace, for the ladies held those most dear
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_17:0.0000:who were most drunken ; so he drank till he could not hold up his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_18:0.0000:head, and could neither hear nor see. The goddess called the valet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_19:0.0000:Souvenir, who roused him only to gaze at the girl more eagerly " a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_20:0.0000:.iiii. doubles " than before. Then the servants brought in a course to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_21:0.0000:appease the fever of love, embraces and kisses, of which many
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_22:0.0250:had their fill ; but the author met with an angry repulse when he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_23:0.0000:tried to steal a kiss.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_24:0.0250:The feast ended with minstrelsy, and then those who had suits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_25:0.0000:came before Venus. A company of canonesses in white, escorted by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_26:0.0000:many knights, approached to lodge a complaint against the gray
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_27:0.0000:nuns for stealing their lovers. The goddess wished to hear the other
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_28:0.0000:side, and a gray nun, supported by many companions, replied that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_29:0.0000:the lovers had been lost through the haughtiness of the canonesses,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_30:0.0000:and won by the legitimate charms of the nuns. After hearing the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_31:0.0000:arguments, Venus in a long speech dwelt on the nature and power of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_32:0.0250:love, and finally gave a verdict for the nuns. Her decision was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0078_33:0.0000:accepted without contest (vv. 1216-18).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_2:0.0000:have merely repetition of material with which we have already be-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_3:0.0000:come familiar. l>ut the combination of the functions of \
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_4:0.0000:this poem is interesting. We have her first a* a divine being, present
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_5:0.0000:in bodily form at the rites of her own worship ; next she figures
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_6:0.0000:great feudal lady presiding at a feast which, apart from its meta-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_7:0.0000:phors, closely follows the forms of a medieval banquet ; and finally,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_8:0.0000:she is a judge, listening to pleadings, giving an exposition oi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_9:0.0000:law, and passing judgment. It is in the first of these three alle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_10:0.0000:gorical pictures, in its distinctly religious aspect, that one finds the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_11:0.0000:most important contribution of Jean de Conde to the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_12:0.0000:tradition. Still, even in the more hackneyed features of the poem,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_13:0.0000:Jean shows such skill in handling the allegory as to entitle him to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_14:0.0000:a place far above the crowd of minor men who had dealt wjth the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_15:0.0000:same theme. The metaphorical banquet belongs to the same kind
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_16:0.0000:of allegory as the palace with hedges of sighs and fountains of t
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_17:0.0250:The " plais " of the canonesses and the gray nuns obviously goes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_18:0.0250:back to debats of the type of the Altcrcatio-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_21:0.0000:The author follows Guillaume de Lorris and the Sire de Beaumanoir
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_22:0.0000:in beginning with a dedication to his lady. Then he tells that one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_23:0.0000:night he dreamt that he was carried off by birds to a forest full of beasts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_24:0.0000:of all kinds and colors. One of these was of surpassing beauty, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_25:0.0000:her breath so sweet that all the others, except the dragon, followed her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_26:0.0000:about. The beasts departed, and the poet was left alone. Presently
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_27:0.0000:he heard a great sound of music, and beheld approaching a company
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_28:0.0000:dressed in cloth of gold and other costly materials, dancing and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_29:0.0000:singing, and in the midst one of noble figure and fair countenance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0079_30:0.0000:and gracious manner, holding a sceptre and wearing a crown of gold
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_1:0.0250:pings, and three knights acted as bodyguard, while the birds sang
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_2:0.0000:all around. After him came a crowd of dames and damsels, knights,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_3:0.0000:squires, and clerks. He saluted Nicole and asked him who he was and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_4:0.0000:who sent him there. The poet told him about the beautiful beast ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_5:0.0000:and the stranger, after listening courteously, proposed that Nicole
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_6:0.0000:should become his vassal. In answer to questions, he declared him-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_7:0.0000:self the God of Love to whom all lovers pray. He it was who hum-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_8:0.0000:bled the proud and exalted the lowly, emboldened the coward and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_9:0.0000:made timid the valiant, and was everywhere omnipotent. The poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_10:0.0250:asked pardon and swore fealty, while the god courteously reproached
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_16:0.0500:beast, who had retired to a fosse which was in the depths of a valley de-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_17:0.0000:fended by a thorn-hedge. The symbolism of the vision was explained
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_18:0.0000:by the god. The beast is a panther, the symbol of Nicole's lady ; her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_19:0.0000:sweet curative breath is her words; the dragon is Envy; the valley,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_20:0.0000:humility; the/osse, simplicity; the thorns, slanderers, and so on.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_21:0.0000:He put his horse to the hedge and rode along the valley till he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_22:0.0000:came within view of the panther. He gazed at her, but had not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_23:0.0000:courage to- speak, and when he tried to get out of the valley the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_24:0.0000:thorns of the hedge scratched him, tore his clothes, and pulled him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_25:0.0000:from his horse. The god came to his rescue and extricated him from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_26:0.0000:his painful position, reproving him gently for not having addressed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_27:0.0000:the panther. Esperance, Dous Penser, and Dous Souvenir then took
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_28:0.0000:charge of the poet and led him to the mansion of Love, where his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_29:0.0000:wounds were cured and much advice was offered him. In response
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0080_30:0.0000:he composed a long dit (vv. 825-966). Then the God and Goddess
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_1:0.0000:Venus exhorted him to have courage, and he quoted in support
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_2:0.0250:of his timidity some verses by Adam [de la Halle]. The go<
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_3:0.0000:advised sending the lady an emerald ring, the meaning <
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_4:0.0000:and the manner of wearing, she explained, and she gave him \
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_5:0.0000:to send with it. Before he despatched it, he had a dream that on pre-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_6:0.0000:senting the ring he had been repulsed, and awaking he told it to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_7:0.0000:goddess, and declared that he should never have courage to send
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_8:0.0000:the missive. Then they exchanged verses, again taken from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_9:0.0000:de la Halle, and after further useless exhortations to have courage,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_10:0.0000:he was told that the only way was to address himself to Fortune.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_11:0.0000:So with his three companions, Esperance, Dous Penser, and I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_12:0.0000:Souvenir, he set out for the Palace of Fortune, which is described
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_13:0.0000:after the model of the same mansion in the AnticlauJianus ' and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_14:0.0000:Roman de la Rose? It is built on a hill of ice, and is half-gorgeous,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_15:0.0000:half-ruinous. Blind Fortune herself sits at the gate, and on her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_16:0.0000:caprice it depends whether one is welcomed by Eiir, who inhabits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_17:0.0000:the beautiful part (called Prosperite), or by Meseiir, who rules the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_18:0.0000:ruins (Adversite). At the moment of Nicole's arrival the goddess
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_19:0.0000:happened to be angry; so he was assigned to Meseiir, in whose abode
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_20:0.0000:(Adversite') he dwelt for a long time. But by the influence of Grace
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_21:0.0000:and Bone Volente' he was transferred to Prosperite', where " la douce
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_22:0.0000:panthere " was staying, accompanied by Merci. Even now he lost
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_23:0.0000:courage, but the ladies about him supported him, and finally the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_24:0.0500:panther yielded to the wishes of her mother Pitie'. Then he awoke
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_25:0.0000:and sang.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_26:0.0000:In this somewhat tedious poem of 2665 verses we find the Court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_27:0.0000:of Love allegory influenced by the Bestiaries. In these character-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_28:0.0000:istically mediaeval productions the Panther is frequently an impor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_29:0.0000:tant animal, and in some is made the type of Christ, the breath also,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_30:0.0000:as in the present form, being symbolical. 3 Nicole's treatment of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_31:0.0250:subject is rather confused. The symbolism is explained by one of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0081_32:0.0000:the characters in the allegory while the poet is still dreaming
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_3:0.0250:more of the inner meaning of his story than of the possibility of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_5:0.0250:The conception of the God of Love as riding in state, followed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_6:0.0000:by a troop of lovers, suggests the procession in Andreas Capellanus,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_7:0.0250:the Lai du Trot, the Confessio Amantis, and other works. 1 The author's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_8:0.0000:acquaintance with the Roman de la Rose is made quite explicit. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_9:0.0500:valley of Humility and the fosse of Simplicity recall the pilgrimage
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_10:0.0500:type of allegory.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_19:0.0000:the first guarded by Dame Nature, and each of the other twelve by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_20:0.0000:a lady representing a Virtue : Sapience, Maniere, Raison, Mesure,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_21:0.0250:Pourveance, Charite', Humilite', Pitie', Debonnairete', Courtoisie,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_22:0.0000:Largesce, Souffisance (i.e. moderate desires). All these virtues in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_23:0.0000:turn give him advice. The porter is Bonte', the chambriere Simplesce.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_24:0.0000:Beauty is described and an account is given of the attempts made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_25:0.0250:by the Virtues to keep off Forfait, Mespresure, Mot Vilain, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0082_26:0.0500:other vices.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0083_16:0.0000:to be visited on the way to the Court. The poet sets out, " touz
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0083_17:0.0000:dormans," and follows the route prescribed. Arriving at the Court,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0083_18:0.0000:he finds an open feast spread. The viands are lovers' glances, sighs,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0083_19:0.0250:dangicrs roasted, sweet smiles, jealousy, gilded melancholy, sauce of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0083_20:0.0500:kisses, and so forth. Then he awakes.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_16:0.0500:Vidal, has more than one point of special interest. It is written in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_17:0.0000:Old French, but in the poem itself there is evidence to show
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_18:0.0000:what the similarity of the author's name to that of the troubadour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_19:0.0500:of the preceding century might lead one to suspect that it was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_20:0.0250:written by a Provencal. 2 Its international relations are further
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_21:0.0000:complicated by the fact that it is the chief example in Old French
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_22:0.0250:of that form of love-allegory which is most characteristic of Middle
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_24:0.0000:On the morning of the first of May, 1338, the poet meets a com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_25:0.0000:pany of ladies and gentlemen going to hunt a boar. There were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_26:0.0000:once two lovers, it appears, who were parted by evil reports. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_27:0.0000:youth complained to Venus and the God of Love, with the result
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0084_28:0.0000:that the slanderer was changed into a boar ; and this is the animal

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_7:0.0000:present point of view. It opens with a buoyant spring song and an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_8:0.0000:account of May-day customs, and then tells of a dream which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_9:0.0250:poet had. Walking in a wood he meets Disdain, a great vilain with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_10:0.0000:a cudgel, and after getting past him with some difficulty, he comes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_11:0.0250:into a beautiful meadow, where there is a spring, a clear stream, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_12:0.0250:a tall pine tree. Here he sees
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_28:0.0250:as well as Medea, Theseus, Semiramis, Paris and Helen, Solomon,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_29:0.0250:Ovid, Aristotle, Dido, Guinevere and Lancelot, Tristan and Yseult,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0086_30:0.0000:and many more. Besides the famous lovers from history and legend,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_22:0.0000:tion of Love as an hermaphrodite. 1 This appears to be due to an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_23:0.0000:attempt to combine Venus and Cupid in one person ; but perhaps
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_24:0.0000:nothing more is intended than a symbol of the god's power over
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_25:0.0000:both sexes. The hovering in the air and the chariot of fire are also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_26:0.0000:both unique, so far. The poet's spying suggests the Prologue to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0087_27:0.0250:Chaucer's Legend of Good Women, and is found still later in Gavin

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_6:0.0000:the conventional May day, a wooded and flowery landscape, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_7:0.0000:singing of birds. The hero, an almost despairing lover, is approached
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_8:0.0000:by two ladies, Plaisance and Esperance, with whom he has a long con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_9:0.0000:versation. They conduct him to the pavilion of the God of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_10:0.0000:which stands in a lande in the wood (vv. 1009-16). On their way
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_11:0.0000:they fall in with Beau Semblant, Douls Regard, Franc Vouloir, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_12:0.0000:other huntsmen engaged in " 1'amoureuse chace." The god is in his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_13:0.0000:pavilion. He receives the author kindly, and commands Plaisance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_14:0.0000:and Esperance to attend him. Accordingly the three continue their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_15:0.0000:walk through the wood. In a meadow, by the side of a stream,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_16:0.0000:they find Bel Acueil, plaiting chaplets of flowers. The poet immedi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0088_17:0.0500:ately kneels down before his lady 8 and begs her to love him.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_11:0.0000:MS.), has been edited by Korting as a translation from Ovid. 1 The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_12:0.0000:poem as a whole has not been accessible to me, but from the very
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_13:0.0250:full rubrics quoted at the end of Korting's extract 2 the following
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_14:0.0250:outline has been put together.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_15:0.0500:After a description of spring, the author tells how Nature appeared
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_16:0.0000:to him and advised him to see the world. Having set out with this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_17:0.0000:purpose, he meets Pallas, Juno, and Venus, escorted by Mercury,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_18:0.0000:who asks him to pronounce anew the Judgment of Paris. 3
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_19:0.0000:The poet decides in favor of Venus, who then talks graciously with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_20:0.0000:him, especially of her sons Jocus or Deduit and Cupid, and of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_21:0.0000:" Vergier de Deduit." After Venus leaves him, he sets out for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_22:0.0000:forest of Diana. Here he meets the goddess herself, whom he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_23:0.0000:describes. She has much to say against Venus and her Garden
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_24:0.0000:of Delight, to seek which, nevertheless, the author immediately pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_25:0.0000:ceeds. On arriving there, he is welcomed by Courtesy, and is allowed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_26:0.0000:to go all about and see its beauty and variety. There he sees the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_27:0.0000:God of Love and his retinue, and describes his beauty and rich
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_28:0.0000:dress and crown. Leesce and Doulz Regart are the god's constant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_29:0.0000:companions. Following the Roman de la Rose, the author describes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_30:0.0000:1 Altframotische Uebersetzung der Remedia Amoris des Ovid, ed. by G. Korting,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0092_32:0.0250:offentliche Bibliothek in Dresden, and also in a MS. in thfe Library of St. Mark's,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_1:0.0250:" le rosier et les roses et le lieu ou Jalousie fist Bel-Acueil empr
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_2:0.0000:ner," and the fountain of Narcissus. Deduit he finds play
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_3:0.0000:with a damsel. After the game is finished, the damsel, at tin- rv
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_4:0.0000:of the God of Love, plays with the author and defeats him. \\
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_5:0.0000:upon Deduit presents her with a chaplet and urges the author to try
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_6:0.0000:again. The God of Love tells how he and Venus, his mother, serve
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_7:0.0000:Nature, and how Deduit and Oyseuse serve them. Diana is afterwards
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_8:0.0000:discussed, and the conversation ends with the author's pretended
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_9:0.0000:homage to the god. Then the author is left to meditation. This
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_10:0.0000:results in a lamentation which causes the god to return, to talk at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_11:0.0000:length on the power of Venus, and to give some commandments.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_12:0.0000:The conversation turns on different ways of seeking satisfaction in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_13:0.0000:love, by violence, gifts, enchantment, etc., each method being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_14:0.0000:illustrated by examples from the classics. The god then leaves him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_15:0.0000:alone once more, and he thinks of the lady that he loves.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_16:0.0000:Pallas now appears and presents the claims of Reason as against
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_17:0.0000:love and carnal delights, enumerating the rules laid down by Ovid in his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_18:0.0000:Remedia Amoris. She exalts the life contemplative over the life amo-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_19:0.0250:rous, and then, following // Tesoro of Brunetto Latini, she expatiates
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_20:0.0250:on Paris and its University, on the King of France, on princes and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_21:0.0000:governments, on society and its origins, on virtues and vices, etc., etc.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_22:0.0000:Although the general composition of this work makes it stand out
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_23:0.0250:clearly from the mass of erotic allegory, there appears from the out-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_24:0.0000:line to be little or nothing in it, save the game of chess from which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_25:0.0000:it takes its name, which is not to be found in Ovid, the Roman Jt
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_26:0.0000:la Rose, Brunetto Latini, and the literature generally current in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_27:0.0000:fourteenth century. The three special sources mentioned the author
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_28:0.0250:seems to have had before him as he wrote. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_30:0.0250:The famous controversy on the character of woman that was raised
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0093_31:0.0500:by Jean de Meun's attacks on the sex in the second part of the Roman
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_1:0.0250:called forth by that controversy happens to have a framework which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_2:0.0250:brings it into the Court of Love category. L'Epistre au Dieu d*
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_3:0.0000:Amours ! of Christine de Pisan was written, as she herself tells us in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_4:0.0000:w. 799-600, in 1399, and it is in the form of a letter from Cupid to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_5:0.0250:all his subjects, reproving men for their ill-doing and ill-speaking
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_6:0.0000:towards women, and defending women against the charges brought
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_7:0.0250:by Jean de Meun and his followers. The opening and closing verses
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_8:0.0250:show clearly Christine's conception of Cupido as a feudal sovereign.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_24:0.0250:sents the religious aspect which so persistently mingles with the sec-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0094_25:0.0250:ular in these allegories. The God is passing sentence on false lovers
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_13:0.0000:(unintentionally, as it seems) involved in the controversy of which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_14:0.0000:Christine's Epistre formed a part. To clear himself he wrote the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_15:0.0000:Excusation de Maistre Alain, contre ceux qui dicnt qu'il a parlc contre
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_16:0.0000:les Dames en son livre nomme La Belle Dame sans Mercy. 3 In this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_17:0.0000:poem he represents Love as appearing to him, drawn bow in hand,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_18:0.0000:just before dawn, and reproaching him. Alain asserts his innocence,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_19:0.0000:alleges the inoffensiveness of his book, and appeals to Love to judge
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0095_20:0.0000:the case. Love lowers his bow, puts the arrow back in the quiver,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_1:0.0500:In spite of this seeming recantation, we have a poem with full
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_2:0.0000:Court of Love machinery in which Alain returns to his charges
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_3:0.0000:against the cruel beauty. In Le Parlcment d* Amour 1 he says that,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_8:0.0000:cypresses and rose-trees, and was watered by a fountain " ds quatre
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_9:0.0000:corniers." Birds sang in the trees, and the gate was guarded by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_10:0.0000:Dangier. In the midst was an audience chamber (auditoire) of green
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_11:0.0000:marjoram, on which were designed in flowers the stories of Paris and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_12:0.0000:Helen, and of the Chatelaine de Vergy, 2 who had loved without
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_13:0.0000:reproach in thought, word, or deed. It was written with marigolds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_14:0.0000:on the turf that Love was going to hold his parliament in that place,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_15:0.0000:to dispense justice. There were twelve presidents, of whom Franc
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_16:0.0000:Vouloir was the first ; Espoir was " procureur des cas " ; and Desir
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_17:0.0000:was advocate. The crowds of people who were thronging to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_18:0.0000:Parliament all seemed to be making their way towards Souvenir, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_19:0.0000:Clerk of Court. Doulx Pensier, the huissier, called for silence, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_20:0.0000:the Clerk bade him to call to audience
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_26:0.0500:Love. Then Desir gave an exposition of the prerogatives of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0096_30:0.0000:The lady asked for counsel; but, though Franc Vouloir granted

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_4:0.0000:mixed with what might be called the pathological aspect of love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_5:0.0250:which is here elaborated for the first time.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_6:0.0000:The poet, who is enjoying himself in the Assembly of I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_7:0.0000:sits down beside his lady and begins to plead his cause ; but, being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_8:0.0000:repulsed, is thrown into a deep melancholy. That night, as lie !
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_9:0.0000:bed, wishing in his misery for death, he falls into a waking dream.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_10:0.0000:He seemed to be walking along a thorny road called "Trop dure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_11:0.0000:Responce," which led him to the bottom of a valley, where he found
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_12:0.0000:a great desert, " Montjoye de Doulours," a dismal place of t
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_13:0.0000:Every tree was full of "gens pendus" who had, like Phyllis, hanged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_14:0.0000:themselves in despair. Under the trees flowed a river full of drowned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_15:0.0000:lovers, among whom he recognized Hero and Leander. There, too,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_16:0.0000:was the fatal Fountain of Narcissus. Swords he saw, stained with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_17:0.0000:the blood of suicides like Pyramus and Thisbe; and a fire fed by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_18:0.0000:lovers, who, like Dido, had given their bodies for fuel. In this dis
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_19:0.0000:mal region, beyond the limits of law and nature, no creature could
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_20:0.0000:live : the rain was tears ; the wind, sighs ; the thunder, a hideous cry.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_21:0.0000:From this desert of despair he was delivered by Esperance and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_22:0.0000:Sapience, who entered into him invisibly, like spirits. He was car-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_23:0.0000:ried off, "plus que le cours " to a blessed place called the " Hospital
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_24:0.0000:d'Amours." The Hospital was built on a rock of ruby ; its walls
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_25:0.0000:were of crystal above, and of dark marble below, and it was sur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_26:0.0000:rounded by a flowery hedge. At the door Bel-Accueil, who bore the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_27:0.0000:keys, gave him a gracious welcome, and led him to Courtoisie,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_28:0.0250:the enfermiere. Within he found thirteen hospitallers : Dame Pine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_29:0.0000:(the Prioress), Loyaulte', Simplesse, Veritd, Congnoissance, Humilite',
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_30:0.0000:Richesse, Largesse, Maniere, Jeunesse, Liesse, Beaute', Courtoisie.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_31:0.0000:There were three Counsellors, Honneur, Entendement, and Souvenir;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_32:0.0000:Pitie' had two servants, Regard and Humble Maintenir ; the chief
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0097_33:0.0250:physician was Espoir. Courtoisie asked his symptoms, and led him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_1:0.0250:away for treatment. They passed the hostel of Piti<, the Prioress,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_2:0.0000:and entered a great hall full of patients, at the end of which was a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_3:0.0000:glorious chapel, in which service was going on. In the chapel was an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_4:0.0000:altar, on which were two images, one of Venus with firebrand and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_5:0.0000:diadem, and one of Cupid with his arrows. The leader of the sing-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_6:0.0000:ing was Liesse, and the priestess Conscience, who that day was cele-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_7:0.0000:brating the mass of Pyramus and Thisbe. Making obeisance to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_8:0.0000:shrine as he passed, the poet came to another apartment, where he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_9:0.0000:found a bed on which Courtoisie made him lie down, while she sum-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_10:0.0000:moned the doctor. Espoir came, felt his pulse, diagnosed the case,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_11:0.0000:and gave him some "eaue de gratieux penser," which put him to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_12:0.0000:sleep. When he woke Pity came to comfort him, and he asked her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_13:0.0000:for ung franc baisier." She was willing to allow him this, but Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_14:0.0000:had made Dangier his gardener, and no tree was so closely guarded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_15:0.0000:as " franc baisier." Yet by her urgent request Dangier was won
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_16:0.0000:over ; and, helped by Espoir, the sick lover staggered to the garden,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_17:0.0000:where, among many ladies, he found his mistress and got the kiss r
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_18:0.0250:which restored his health at once.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_21:0.0250:found buried true lovers like Tristan and Lancelot ; there, too, lay
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_25:0.0500:Jason, Demophon, <#)neas, Narcissus, La Belle Dame sans Mercy,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_27:0.0500:Now his desire returned to him, but Dangier denied him access to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_28:0.0000:his lady. The hospitaliers did their best for him. Espoir, the physi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_29:0.0000:cian, recommended a sacrifice to Love, advising him to avoid thought,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_30:0.0000:seek cheerful company, read pleasant stories, and above all keep him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0098_31:0.0000:(Espoir) in mind, since he could cure all such griefs except when

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_5:0.0250:Love rose and, calling him his son, gave him encoui . and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_6:0.0000:asked why he had stopped writing songs in his honor. Had he lost
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_7:0.0000:his good will, or did he think the god had lost his power ? He
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_8:0.0000:no to both questions ; he knew that only Love or death could re-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_9:0.0000:lease him from his present pain. After further reproaches on one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_10:0.0000:side and professions of repentance on the other, Love took pity and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_11:0.0000:told him to return to the garden, where he should find Dangier asleep.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_12:0.0000:Then he awoke, went to the garden, and found Dangier asleep.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_13:0.0000:Near by was his own lady. Her he told all about his case and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_14:0.0000:god's promises, and entreated her not to make Love a liar. She
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_15:0.0000:changed color, said she could not disobey so great a lord, and granted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_16:0.0000:" ung franc baisier." He returned to the chapel to sacrifice a turtle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_17:0.0000:dove made of laurel-wood in token of gratitude. Then he thanked
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_18:0.0000:the ladies in the Hospital for their kindness, after which he sud-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_19:0.0000:denly awoke. The poem ends with a wish that the vision may come
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_20:0.0250:true.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_21:0.0250:It has seemed worth while to give a somewhat full summary of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_22:0.0000:this poem for several reasons. First, it is, as literature, one of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_23:0.0000:most interesting of its century. The scheme of the allegory is much
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_24:0.0000:more original than usual, and it is carried out with vigor and con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_25:0.0000:sistency. The description of the chapel of the God of Love as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_26:0.0000:a part of the larger building, and as containing images of Cupid and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_27:0.0000:Venus is closely paralleled in the English Court of Love. The con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_28:0.0000:ception of the Hospital and that of the cemetery were both new, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_29:0.0000:both were imitated very soon. The picture of the Valley of Despair
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_30:0.0000:is done with such grimness and power as to suggest the Divine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_31:0.0500:Comedy.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_32:0.0250:RENE OF ANJOU.i
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0099_34:0.0250:mirer of Alain Chartier and as the imitator of the Hospital d'Ani,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_1:0.0500:century there is perhaps no figure presenting more, and more varied,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_2:0.0000:points of interest than this monarch. As King of Jerusalem and of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_3:0.0000:y, and as Duke of Bar, of Lorraine, and of Anjou, he was of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_4:0.0000:the first importance socially and politically; that he was an artist
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_5:0.0000:of no mean skill is proved by the graceful drawings he made in illus-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_6:0.0000:tration of his books ; he appears as a moral reformer in his substitu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_7:0.0000:tion of the games of the Fete-Dieu 1 for the licentious " Jeux des
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_8:0.0000:Fous," and as a musician in composing the accompaniments for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_9:0.0000:some of these ceremonies ; and, finally, as a writer, he exchanged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_10:0.0000:ballades with the Duke of Orle'ans, composed an extensive work on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_11:0.0000:chivalry, and wrote a very long allegorical poem inspired by the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_12:0.0000:Roman dt la Rose and the Hospital d' Amours. It is to this very ver-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_13:0.0250:satility, no doubt, that the almost complete neglect of his claims to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_14:0.0000:recognition as a man of letters is due. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_15:0.0250:Le Livre du Cuer d 'Amours Espris* (A.D. 1457), as Renews allegory
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_16:0.0500:is called, is a work, partly prose and partly verse, in the form of a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_18:0.0500:One night the author dreams that his heart leaves his breast, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_19:0.0250:armed and equipped by Desir sets out to seek Doulce Mercy. His
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_20:0.0000:equipment includes a helmet, "timbre' tout de fleurs d'amoureuses
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_21:0.0000:pense'es," a sword, and a shield of " esperance pure " with three forget-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_22:0.0000:me-nots on it. His horse is Franc Vouloir. After a long series of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_23:0.0000:adventures^ in which the usual personifications take part (Jalouzie,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_24:0.0000:Melencolie, Bel Acueil, Tristesse, Humble Requeste, Honneur, Lar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_25:0.0000:gesce, and many more), and in which allegorical place-names occur
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_26:0.0000:(such as the manor of Bon Repos, the river of Tears, the forest of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_27:0.0000:Longue Actente, the bridge Pas Perilleux, and the plain of Pense'e
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_28:0.0000:Ennuyeuse), the Heart with his two companions, Desir and Lar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_29:0.0250:gesce, comes to the seacoast and sets sail for the Isle of the God
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_30:0.0000:of Love. As they approach the island they see a beautiful castle ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0100_34:0.0250:the literary reputation of Rent's princely contemporaries, Charles d'Orleans and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_2:0.0250:great establishment called L'Ospital cT Amours. The church.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_3:0.0250:" tout le pourpris de leans," was built on a rock of diamond. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_4:0.0000:walls were of marble and jasper, and the roof was covered with plates
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_5:0.0000:of enamelled silver. The Heart and his companions are entertained
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_7:0.0500:prioress.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_8:0.0000:Behind the church is a cemetery, which the Heart is eager to see,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_9:0.0000:because he has heard that Alain Chartier and other notabilities are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_10:0.0000:buried there. On the portal of the cemetery are blazoned the arms
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_11:0.0000:of many great personages, who have visited the Hospital and who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_12:0.0000:by thus, as it were, hanging up their shields have testified their sub-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_13:0.0250:jection to Love. Under each blazon is an inscription written "comme
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_14:0.0000:en epitaphe," telling whose the arms are and why their owner had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_15:0.0000:come thither. A long list of the blazons and inscriptions is given.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_16:0.0000:It includes those of David, Hercules, and Theseus, Julius Caesar
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_17:0.0000:and Mark Antony, Launcelot and Tristan, Charles Quint, Gaston
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_18:0.0000:Phe'bus, Comte de Foix, and King Rend himself. After examining
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_19:0.0000:the portal, the Heart and his companions enter the cemetery. It
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_20:0.0000:contains many tombs, six of which attract the visitor's particular
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_21:0.0000:attention. They are those of Ovid, Guillaume de Machaut, Boc-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_22:0.0000:caccio, Jean de Meun, Petrarch, and Alain Chartier, and they stand
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_23:0.0000:together in an enclosure by themselves. When the Heart asks Dame
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_24:0.0000:Courtoisie to whom some of the other tombs belong, she refers him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_25:0.0000:to " the book of L? Ospital d" 1 Amours, written by a clerk of Tournay." 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_26:0.0000:Then she shows him, outside the cemetery, the bodies of Love's ex-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_27:0.0000:communicates, unburied and frightful to see.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_28:0.0250:After hearing mass in the church for the souls of two lovers newly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_29:0.0000:slain through jealousy, the Heart visits and kisses the relics (such
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_31:0.0500:1 " Elle lui dist que s'il en vouloit savoir, qu'il lisist et regardast le livre de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_33:0.0000:en deviseroit" (p. 133). This passage is valuable, not only as an acknowledg-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_34:0.0000:ment of the source of King Rene's description of the Hospital, etc., but as evi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0101_35:0.0500:dence that he knew that L' Hospital d'Amours was not written by Alain Chartier.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_12:0.0000:Ce tres bel chastel de Plaisance estoit fonde* sur une roche d'esmeraude,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_13:0.0500:en l.iquelle y avoit vaines de dyamans nayfz, foison et si grant quantite' que
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_14:0.0250:on y veoit presqu'autant ou plus de dyamans que d'esmerauldes. Les quatre
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_15:0.0000:pans des murs dudit beau chastel estoient de cristal, et y avoit a chacun pan

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_17:0.0500:(pp. 145-6).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_18:0.0250:At the gate the wanderers are met by Bel Acueil, who consents to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_19:0.0000:ask the God of Love to receive le Cuer's homage. Love replies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_20:0.0000:favorably and the companions enter the castle, escorted by Bel
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_21:0.0000:Acueil. In the courtyard they find Oyseuse, who tells them that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_22:0.0000:God of Love is " en bien estroit conseil " with his mother Venus,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_23:0.0000:and must not be disturbed. She shows the new-comers the wonders
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_24:0.0000:of the castle until Love is ready to receive them. When, finally,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_25:0.0000:they enter the great hall, they find the god in royal raiment; "et
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_26:0.0000:tiroit sayettes et moult fleiches par les fenestres de la salle a la
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_27:0.0000:volle'e hors, et pas ne lui chaloit sur qui elles cheussent." Bel Acueil
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_28:0.0000:presents the Heart to Love. Desir begs the god to receive the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_29:0.0000:stranger into his service and to lend him the aid of his knights in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_30:0.0000:the conquest of Doulce Mercy. Love is in no hurry, and meantime
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_31:0.0000:they are well entertained. After dinner Dame Venus enters, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_32:0.0000:council is held, and orders are issued for the campaign. The quest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_33:0.0000:is undertaken by the Heart, Pitie', Bel Acueil, Promesse, and Hum-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_34:0.0000:ble Requeste. Doulce Mercy is won and is being conducted to the

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0102_36:0.0250:reappear and attack so violently that, in spite of the Heart's valor,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_1:0.0000:the lady is recaptured, his friends fall, and he himself is severely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_2:0.0000:wounded. Pitie', who has been hiding in a thicket during the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_3:0.0500:finds the Heart more dead than alive. She restores him to con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_4:0.0000:sciousness, and takes him to the Hospital of Love, where he wishes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_5:0.0250:to spend the rest of his days in prayer.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_6:0.0000:In this work three main streams of influence are evident. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_7:0.0000:opening part, with the symbolical armor and the wandering adven-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_8:0.0000:tures, belongs to the class of La Voie de Paradis and Guillaume de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_9:0.0250:Digulleville's Pelerinage. 1 The armor passage, which is frequently
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_10:0.0000:paralleled in religious allegory, is doubtless to be traced to St. Paul ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_11:0.0000:from the elaboration of the same idea we have pieces like Henryson's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_12:0.0000:Garment of Good Ladies? The second part is confessedly imi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_13:0.0000:from L 1 Hospital d' Amours, even to details like Courtoisie the cnfcr-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_14:0.0000:miere, and Pitie the prieuse. The addition of the relics is new,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_15:0.0000:but is in keeping with the description of the chapel and its services
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_16:0.0000:in the earlier poem. The concluding section with the rescue and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_17:0.0000:loss of the lady shows the influence of the Roman de la Rose most
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_18:0.0000:distinctly. The work stands apart (though not quite alone) among
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_21:0.0000:Charles, Duke of Orleans, father of Louis XII. of France, was a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_22:0.0000:friend of King Renews, and, as has been said, joined him in the fash-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_23:0.0000:ionable amusement of writing lyrics in competition. He was taken
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_24:0.0000:prisoner by the English at the battle of Agincourt (Oct. 25, 1415),
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_25:0.0000:and remained in England till he was ransomed in 1440. During
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_26:0.0000:these twenty-five years the captive duke doubtless found abundant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_27:0.0000:leisure for writing poetry, and a large body of his verse has come
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_28:0.0000:down to us. His extant works consist chiefly of love-poems cast
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_29:0.0000:in the elaborate verse forms that were fashionable in his time, .ind
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0103_30:0.0500:of poems bewailing his captivity. Among the love-poems is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_1:0.0500:William Allan Neilson.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_3:0.0000:for a number of ballades, rondeaux, and chansons. The arrange-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_4:0.0000:ment of Charles's poems in the order designed by him is a task
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_5:0.0000:which has not yet been successfully accomplished, so that it is not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_6:0.0000:possible to tell which of these short poems he intended to be con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_7:0.0250:tained in the whole, of which the allegory forms the framework.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_11:0.0000:in charge to a lady called Enfance and later to Dame Jeunesse. One
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_12:0.0000:St. Valentine's morning Jeunesse woke him and invited him to go
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_13:0.0000:with her to the God of Love. On arriving at the gate of a pleasant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_14:0.0000:manor, they were admitted by the porter, Compaignie. Bel Acueil
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_15:0.0000:and Plaisance welcomed them and led them before the God of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_16:0.0000:who was surrounded by courtiers singing and dancing. Jeunesse
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_17:0.0000:presented Charles as a scion of the house of France, and Love wel-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_18:0.0000:comed him, saying he had known his father and others of his lineage,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_19:0.0000:and asking if he had been struck by his dart yet. Then he handed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_20:0.0000:him over to Plaisant Beautd, with orders to give him no rest till she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_21:0.0000:had made him one of Love's vassals. She was to think of her con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_22:0.0000:quests over Samson and Solomon, and keep up her reputation.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_23:0.0000:When Beautd sat down beside Charles, he could not keep his eyes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_24:0.0000:off her ; so she sent a dart through them to his heart, which leapt
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_25:0.0000:for joy. He sent a thought to remove the dart, but in vain, and in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_26:0.0000:great distress and deadly pale he threw himself at Love's feet. Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_27:0.0000:laughed at him and recommended a doctor, and joked him about his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_28:0.0000:quick overthrow. At the instance of Beautd Charles yielded, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_29:0.0000:she then went to Love, announced his repentance, and begged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_30:0.0000:mercy on his behalf. Love appointed Beaute' his deputy, and she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_31:0.0000:laid down four chief commandments which Charles had to swear to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_32:0.0250:obey, and six minor rules which it would be well for him to follow. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_33:0.0000:He was then duly sworn ; Bonne Foy, chief secretary of Love, made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0104_34:0.0000:out the " lettre de retenue," Loyaultd sealed it, and it was delivered

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_2:0.0000:privileges of their realm and the assistance of their officers, and

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_6:0.0000:English translation, 1 apparently made from a lost MS., carries on the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_7:0.0000:narrative. The " lettre de retenue " Charles received with gratitude
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_8:0.0000:and humility, and promised life-long service. In exchange for his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_9:0.0000:heart he asked for another his lady's, since she had his. At this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_10:0.0000:Love looked sad, and said he lacked wit in supposing his lady could
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_11:0.0000:give her heart to every one who asked it. She must have her choice ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_12:0.0000:and Charles's business was to devise ways of winning her in a fitting
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_13:0.0000:fashion. Charles turned to look at Beauty, but finding her sur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_14:0.0000:rounded by Disdain and cruel Danger, he was afraid to speak lest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_15:0.0000:he might make his case worse, especially since Pity was asleep. So
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_16:0.0000:he decided to write a bill beseeching her to grant him some of her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_17:0.0000:heart were it only a piece of the size of a pin's head to save his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_18:0.0000:life. Withdrawing with Hope into an arbor, he sat down with the pen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_19:0.0000:and paper which he supplied, and tried to write something pleasing.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_20:0.0000:The ballades, etc., may be supposed to be the results of his efforts.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_21:0.0000:After the ballades the allegory is again taken up in the French
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_22:0.0000:MSS., and is continued in a series of short pieces in a variety of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_23:0.0000:forms of verse. The first of these is the Songe et Complainte. I n
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_24:0.0000:this Charles tells how one night in a dream there appeared to him an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_25:0.0000:old man whom he thought he had seen before, but whom he failed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_26:0.0000:to recognize. The visitor, however, explains that he is Aage, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_27:0.0000:had come once before from Dame Nature, bearing the letters charg-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_28:0.0000:ing Enfance to deliver the hero to Jeunesse. Raison, Aage said,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_29:0.0000:had complained to Nature of the many faults committed by Jeunesse
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_30:0.0000:and Charles ; and he warned the poet that this was no light m
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_31:0.0000:because Vieillesse, " la mere de courrous," would soon attack him,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_32:0.0000:and that, since she could not be escaped, he had better give up Folie
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0105_33:0.0250:and Love, while he still had Jeunesse. No one could serve satisfac-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_1:0.0000:torily both Amour and Vieillesse, and Amour ought to excuse him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_2:0.0000:now that his mistress was dead. Every one mocked an old man
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_3:0.0000:in love ; but while a man was still young he might honorably aban-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_4:0.0000:don love " comme par Nonchalance," and no one could say it was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_5:0.0000:through compulsion, but it would be clear that it was because of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_6:0.0000:faithfulness to the memory of his peerless lady. So he ought humbly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_7:0.0000:to ask the God of Love to release him from his allegiance^ and,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_8:0.0000:thanking him for the benefits received while in his service, retire
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_9:0.0000:honorably. With his fellow-subjects, too, he should first clear all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_10:0.0000:scores, asking pardon for any offences he might have committed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_11:0.0000:against them. Such was the advice of Aage, who concluded his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_12:0.0000:speech with a warning against Fortune, who would be certain to try
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_13:0.0000:to hinder him from the course recommended, holding up the terrors
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_14:0.0250:of ennui, but who should not be trusted, for she was as false as the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_15:0.0250:moon.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_17:0.0000:depressed at the prospect, to follow the old man's counsel. So he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_18:0.0000:determined to write a request for an honorable discharge, which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_19:0.0000:would stop the mouths of slanderers, and to present it to Amour at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_20:0.0000:his next feast.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_21:0.0250:La Rc$uestc follows, " aux excellens et puissans en noblesse, Dieu
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_22:0.0000:Cupido et Venus la de'esse." The petition recounts the poet's faith-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_23:0.0000:ful service,' and asks that on account of the death of his lady and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_24:0.0000:the impossibility of his ever loving again, he should get back his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_25:0.0000:heart and be freed from his oath ; and that Bonne Foy should be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_26:0.0000:ordered to make out a letter of quittance. If this is done, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_27:0.0000:promises to pray for Love and to remember the favor that he has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_28:0.0000:received and is going to receive through his "bonne mercy."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_29:0.0000:La Dtspartie (T Amours, which comes next, consists of nine bal-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_30:0.0000:lades and two other pieces. The first ballade tells how he presented
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_31:0.0000:his petition at the next parliament held by Amour, and how the god
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_32:0.0000:urged him to throw aside his grief and seek another mistress. In
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_33:0.0000:the second, the poet insists on the hopelessness of this, and pleads
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_34:0.0000:the granting of his request. In the third the god politely regrets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_35:0.0000:the poet's determination, acknowledges his faithfulness in the past,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0106_36:0.0000:and promises to grant his wish. The fourth tells of the passing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_1:0.0250:in his bosom. Then follows the formal quittance, in which Amour,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_2:0.0000:counselled by Franc Desir, declares Charles free from his oath,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_3:0.0000:vouches that he leaves the service of Love, not " par deffaulte, for-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_4:0.0000:fait ou vice," but solely because of the death of his lady, to l
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_5:0.0000:he wishes to remain as faithful as the widowed turtle-dove to her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_6:0.0000:mate. The letter is sealed and dated from the castle of Plaisant Recept
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_7:0.0000:on the day of the Feste des Mors. In the fifth ballade he is so over-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_8:0.0000:come by grief that when Amour in pity offers him his assistance, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_9:0.0000:is unable to speak, and takes his leave without a word, while Amour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_10:0.0000:hands him over to Confort, who, in the sixth ballade, leads him to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_11:0.0000:the manor of Nonchaloir. In the seventh, Passe-Temps, the governor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_12:0.0000:of this mansion, receives him, and approves of his resolve to spend
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_13:0.0000:the rest of his life there. Confort is sent back to report to Amour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_14:0.0000:his favorable reception. The letter which Confort bore to Amour fol-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_15:0.0250:lows, and in it Charles says that he shall always be eager to hear
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_16:0.0000:news of Amour ; that he is in good spirits in the house of Noncha-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_17:0.0000:loir ; that he hopes to stay there till he has to go to end his days
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_18:0.0250:with Vieillesse, a prospect which is gloomy enough but which is still,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_19:0.0000:thank God, far off; that he sends back Confort, for whose good
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_20:0.0250:company he is grateful, and who will ask pardon for him if, through
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_21:0.0000:Non Savoir, he does not address the god properly ; that he wishes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_22:0.0000:now to thank Amour for all past benefits, a thing he was unable to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_23:0.0000:do at the moment of parting, on account of his emotion ; and that he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_24:0.0250:will pray the Almighty to grant Amour honor and long life, and vic-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_25:0.0500:tory over the company of false Dangier.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_26:0.0250:In the eighth ballade Charles wishes to try whether he still pos-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_27:0.0000:sesses his old power of rhyming, and in the last he says that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_28:0.0000:plaster of Nonchaloir which he had applied to his heart has so cured
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_29:0.0000:him that he is now in good condition and forever proof against
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_30:0.0000:the " amoureuse maladie." He strains his eyes to catch a glimpse
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_31:0.0000:of his old enemy Plaisant Beaute', but they are "si treshastis, et
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_32:0.0250:trop plains de leur vouloir." The mood with which the poem closes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0107_33:0.0250:is expressed in the last envoi :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_1:0.0000:Though the story is told with the elegance for which Charles is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_2:0.0250:famous, and without many of the crudities which disfigured most of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_3:0.0500:the poems we have had to deal with, yet it cannot be claimed that he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_4:0.0000:has added anything of importance to the material of love-allegory.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_5:0.0000:The general scheme is very familiar, though we .may perhaps discern
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_6:0.0000:a touch of realism in the picture of the royal court, as, for exam-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_7:0.0000:ple, when the god graciously calls to mind members of Charles's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_8:0.0000:family when he is first presented. The figure is the feudal one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_9:0.0000:throughout, never the religious. The " lettre de retenue " we had in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_10:0.0000:germ as far back as the charter granted by the God of Love, in De
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_11:0.0000:Venus la Deesse d'Amor * ; and the commandments have been often
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_12:0.0000:paralleled. The exchange of hearts is found in Le Roman de la Poire? 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_13:0.0000:Samson and Solomon are stock examples of the power of woman.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_14:0.0000:The conceit about Enfance, Jeunesse, and Vieillesse, and the cure at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_15:0.0000:the mansion of Nonchaloir are the most individual points.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0108_17:0.0500:is less bound by convention and more alive to the psychological sig-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0110_34:0.0000:riol nothing but a " traite" de rhe'torique " contained in La Departie. He sug-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0110_35:0.0000:Simon Bourgoing as a possible author of some portion of the composite
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0110_36:0.0250:work (ibid., p. 256), and is disposed to limit the authorship of Saint-Gelais to a

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_8:0.0250:Saint-Gelais. This work, which is partly in prose, suggests, in sev-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_9:0.0000:eral respects, King Renews Livre du Cuer d* Amours Espris, and in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_10:0.0250:the course of it the writer takes occasion to eulogize both that author 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_11:0.0250:and Alain Chartier. 8 The allegory is a slightly veiled autobiography,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_12:0.0000:the Sejour d'Honneur being merely an episode. The poet falls
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_13:0.0000:asleep while meditating in his chamber. Sensuality appears to him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_14:0.0000:in the shape of a lovely woman and leads him by the roads of Fleurie
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_15:0.0000:Jeunesse and Deduit Mondain to the Port de Mondaine Liesse,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0112_16:0.0000:whence they sail to the island of Vaine Esperance. Leaving this

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0113_14:0.0000:in a dark corner, is chosen judge, and a long argument ensues.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0113_19:0.0000:sions on such subjects as ecclesiastical politics and the Immacu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0113_20:0.0000:late Conception. The statutes of the Poeme de la Prison of Charles

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_2:0.0000:own century. His conception of the sovereignty of Love is not at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_3:0.0000:all consistent. At the opening of the poem the figure is military,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_4:0.0000:and the God of Love descends into the besieged castle to reassure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_5:0.0000:his people. But when the castle is described, it has indeed the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_6:0.0000:usual pleasure grounds attached, but the building itself becomes a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_7:0.0000:temple with ecclesiastical furniture and attendants, like the chapel in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_8:0.0500:the Hospital d* Amours. Again, when Franc Vouloir champions the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_9:0.0000:cause of the ladies, the dispute becomes purely legal, Truth is taken
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_10:0.0000:as judge, and the God of Love is lost sight of altogether. In fact,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_11:0.0000:the poet too indiscriminately picked up from contemporary models
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_12:0.0000:fragments of different allegorical conceptions, no one of which was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_13:0.0000:particularly well-fitted for his purpose of a prolonged debate, and,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_14:0.0000:failing to give them any unity by a vigorous individual treatment,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_15:0.0000:produced a poem which is, to an unusual extent even in the fifteenth
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_19:0.0000:dialogue between Entendement and the author, but this dialogue
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_20:0.0000:takes place in a dream. This accords with an increasingly preva-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_21:0.0000:lent tendency. As the Middle Ages wore to an end and the intel-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_22:0.0000:lectual attitude became more rationalistic, it was more and more felt
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_23:0.0000:as imperative to resort to some such device as a dream to justify the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_24:0.0000:fantastic machinery of the allegory. In De Phyllide et Flora and its
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_25:0.0000:French derivatives the poets frankly place the pleasure gardens of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_26:0.0000:the God of Love within easy riding distance of the quite earthly and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_27:0.0000:natural opening scene, while the fifteenth century Hospital d* Amours
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_28:0.0000:has a vision within a vision in its effort to avoid the palpably absurd.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_29:0.0000:Yet it must be remembered that the English Court of Love, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0114_30:0.0250:dating from the sixteenth century, is not a dream ; and it is prob-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_6:0.0000:Death. In the first park, seated on a beautiful throne, is a young
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_7:0.0000:prince, naked, blindfold, and holding in his hand a drawn bow. IK-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_8:0.0000:is accompanied by his mother Venus (for it immediately appears

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_17:0.0000:of their wanderings, before Venus and the God of Love. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_18:0.0000:divinities converse with a hermit, who rails at them, and with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_19:0.0000:young churchman, who is seduced into staying with them. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_20:0.0000:prince has an audience in his turn. Venus and Cupid try to enlist
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_21:0.0000:him under their standard ; but since, according to the title, he is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_22:0.0000:"conquerant le Royaulme de bonne Renomme'e," he has strength
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_23:0.0250:enough to resist, and subsequently is received into the Chateau des

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_29:0.0250:gory. His L'Amant rendu Cordelier? though in the form of a dream,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0115_30:0.0500:is not strictly an allegory; yet his familiarity with such poems as we

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_5:0.0000:occurs, by way of prologue, a description in verse of the Parlement
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_6:0.0250:d' Amours in which the decisions are rendered. Though much of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_7:0.0000:gorgeousness of the traditional Court of Love is retained, the god
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_8:0.0000:or king is replaced by a president, and legal imagery prevails. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_25:0.0000:de Plaisance et Fleur de Rhetoricque? seems to have been intended as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_26:0.0250:a collection of both precepts and examples in the art of poetry. It
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0116_27:0.0250:begins with a versified treatise on rhetoric, and the pieces which

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_3:0.0000:already discussed under their respective authors ; others are anony-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_4:0.0250:mous. The fourth piece, Le Chief de Joyeuse Destinee, is an allegor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_5:0.0000:ical romance meant to show that love is the source of all good and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_6:0.0250:all evil. It has the familiar figures of Doux Regard, Bon Avis,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_7:0.0250:Loyaute, SoupQon, Haut Vouloir, Secret Penser, etc., and a descrip-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_8:0.0250:tion of the Palais d' Amours. The Jardin de Plaisance of the title
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_9:0.0250:is the scene in which many of the episodes, otherwise unconnected,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_10:0.0000:take place. For example, there is a morisque in which FAmoureux
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_11:0.0000:Languissant, Envieuse Jalousie, and others perform; and a number
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_12:0.0000:of ballades, rondeaux, and similar poems are introduced as the pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_13:0.0000:ductions of the lovers who frequent the garden. The volume as a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_14:0.0000:whole is so loosely put together that Goujet surmises that the com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_15:0.0000:piler died before completing his work, and that the contents of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_16:0.0250:portfolios were published haphazard by some one who did not

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_22:0.0000:that ensues, the downcast youth (le venant) speaks from experience
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_23:0.0000:of the pains he has suffered there, while the cheerful one (I'aHant)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0117_24:0.0000:maintains that great joys are to be expected. He is not deterred

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_25:0.0000:French, written before the time of the English Court of Love, which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_26:0.0000:have the idea of the God or Goddess of Love holding a court either
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_27:0.0000:as their centre or as an important part of their framework. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_28:0.0000:poems which merely contain allusions to this conception, or which

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_31:0.0250:par devant le Dieu Cupidon, pour une fill e, fort plaisante et recreative, & 4 person-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_32:0.0250:nages, summarized in La Valliere, Bibl. du TheAtre Francois, Dresden, 1768, 1, 10-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_33:0.0500:ii (from Recueil de plusieurs Farces, Paris, 1612). La Valliere dates it "towards
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0118_34:0.0500:the end of the fifteenth century."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_4:0.0500:Allegory, as a special literary form, plays a very much smaller part
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_5:0.0250:in the literature of Italy than in that of France or England during
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_6:0.0000:the centuries on which we are engaged. We do indeed find allegor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_7:0.0000:ical figures occurring frequently enough in Italian poems, and occa-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_8:0.0000:sionally whole works belonging to this class ; but there does not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_9:0.0000:seem to have been a time, like the period of French literature that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_10:0.0000:we have just been dealing with, when this was the form that a poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_11:0.0000:turned to, almost as a matter of course, when he wished to use his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_12:0.0000:imagination or to write of love. Dante, to be sure, used the alle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_13:0.0000:gorical method a great deal : the Vita Nuova is tinged with allegory,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_14:0.0000:and the Divine Comedy has much in it that can be so described.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_15:0.0000:But in both cases it is the detail about which this statement can be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_16:0.0000:made ; for the former has no plot in the sense in which the French
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_17:0.0000:allegorical romances have plot, and, in spite of the parabolic signifi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_18:0.0000:cation of such figures as Virgil and Beatrice, the outlines of the epic
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_19:0.0000:are the outlines of the poet's actual beliefs regarding the next world.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_20:0.0500:The reason for this contrast between the French and the Italian
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_21:0.0250:mediaeval literature is not far to seek. Allegory is a characteristically
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_22:0.0000:mediaeval form ; and in Italy the Middle Ages began so late and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_23:0.0000:Renaissance came so early that that country never had the oppor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_24:0.0000:tunity to fall completely under the spell that held France from the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_25:0.0250:time of the Roman de la Rose till the end of the fifteenth century.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_26:0.0000:Thus Petrarch, in spite of the fact that he wrote perhaps more pure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_27:0.0500:allegory than any other Italian, was at the same time an enthusiast
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_28:0.0000:for the New Learning.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_29:0.0500:But if the more formal part of the Court of Love tradition is not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_30:0.0000:prominent in Italy, many of its minor features abound. The poets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_31:0.0000:of that country, with their delicate and subtle treatment of the pas-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_32:0.0000:sion of love, give us much material for the history of the growth of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_33:0.0000:the chivalrous ideal. In this they show their indebtedness to Pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0119_34:0.0250:vengal sources of inspiration; and of their intimacy with French
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_2:0.0250:The earliest genuine specimens of love-allegory in Italy are direct
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_3:0.0000:borrowings from France. The Roman de la Rose was widely known * ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_4:0.0000:and // Fiore? by a certain Ser Durante, whose identity has not yet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_5:0.0000:been perfectly ascertained, though not exactly a" translation, is a

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_7:0.0000:poem. The elaborate descriptions, the mythological, philosophical,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_8:0.0000:and sociological digressions are cut out, though most of the personifi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_9:0.0000:cations, except Nature and Genius, are retained. Bel Acueil, whom
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0120_10:0.0000:the exigencies of gender led Guillaume de Lorris to make a young man,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0121_8:0.0000:subject of biology, directs him to a great plain 2 in which he finds

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_5:0.0250:In the Vita Nuova, Love is often personified : as, for example, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_6:0.0000:the garment of a pilgrim, 2 or as a youth in white raiment. 3 Frequently
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_7:0.0000:he is described as a lord giving commands. 4 Lovers are his liege-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_8:0.0000:men (" i fedeli d'amore "). 5 Once 6 he is a lord of fearful aspect who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_9:0.0000:appears holding the lady in his arms and feeding her with the burn-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0122_15:0.0500:which the Court of Love is held out of doors.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_11:0.0250:love. 1 The shade also pointed out and named to Petrarch some of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_12:0.0000:the famous lovers who followed the triumphal car of Amore (Julius
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_13:0.0000:Caesar, Hercules, Demophoon, Jason, Venus and Mars, Lancelot and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_14:0.0000:Guinevere, Tristan and Iseult, and others), sometimes sketching
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_15:0.0000:their sad history. The poet was trembling at the proofs thus given
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_23:0.0250:complaints against the unsatisfactoriness of the God of Love. Tamed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_24:0.0250:now, 2 he looked about him to see if there were any poet there among
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_25:0.0250:the rout. He saw Orpheus, Pindar, Virgil, Ovid, Catullus, Propertius,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0123_28:0.0500:mother's kingdom, in a delectable isle in the ygean which had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_14:0.0250:sonifications in the first of the lines quoted, run into those paradox-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_15:0.0000:ical conceits which occur all through the Middle Ages, and which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_17:0.0000:In the isle of Venus Petrarch was brought to a wretched prison,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_18:0.0000:or Hades, in which he was confined for a long time, finding relief at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_19:0.0000:last in a consideration of the nature of Love and in pitying his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_20:0.0000:fellow-prisoners. Some of these are represented as telling him their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_21:0.0500:tragic stories.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_24:0.0250:The "Triumph " form which Petrarch used here and in the similar
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_25:0.0000:poems on Death, Fame, Time, and Divinity, was, of course, suggested
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_26:0.0000:by the Roman triumphs awarded to successful generals. Ovid had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_27:0.0000:used it in a Triumph of Love, 2 which has been already quoted. It
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_28:0.0000:was a favorite motive in mediaeval art, appearing, especially in Italy,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_29:0.0000:in paintings and carvings as well as in poetry. 8 A century after
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0124_30:0.0250:Petrarch it was freely employed by Francesco Colonna. 4

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_14:0.0250:Entering, he sees a hall painted with portraits of philosophers, poets,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_15:0.0000:and historians, and with the Seven Sciences and other symbolic"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_16:0.0000:figures. The paintings are described at great length. Among them
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_17:0.0000:is the picture of a most lovely woman, "La Gloria del mondo,"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_18:0.0000:enthroned and crowned, holding a sword and an apple of gold.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_19:0.0000:Around her are a throng of mythological, scriptural, historical, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_20:0.0000:romantic figures. In a green meadow (still in the painting) the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_21:0.0000:sees Love, a beautiful youth with golden hair, winged, clad in cloth
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_22:0.0000:of gold, and holding a bow and two arrows, one of gold and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_23:0.0000:other of lead. Round him are many worshippers, some gay and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_24:0.0000:jocund, others sad and sighing grievously. Seated beside him in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_25:0.0000:great honor is a lady like an angel, whom the poet supposes to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_26:0.0000:" her who was formerly adored in Cyprus." There are also paint-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_27:0.0500:ings of many legendary love-episodes, from Jove and Europa to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_28:0.0250:Tristram and Iseult.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0125_31:0.0500:the walls. He is next conducted into a beautiful garden adorned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_3:0.0500:awakes, and is very sorrowful.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_18:0.0250:midst, raised on lofty columns, was a temple, around which danced
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_19:0.0000:young men and maidens, and above which doves were flying.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_20:0.0000:Monna Pace sat before the door and beside her Pazienza, while
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_21:0.0000:within, the altar-flames were fanned by sighs caused by Gelosia.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_22:0.0000:Priapus held the highest place in the temple. There were also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_23:0.0000:many relics in the sanctuary, showing the power of love, broken
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_24:0.0000:bows of Diana's band, Atalanta's apples, and the like. The walls
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_25:0.0000:were painted with the stories of Pyramus and Thisbe and many an-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_26:0.0000:other lover. In a more secret part of the temple she (i.e. Palemo's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_27:0.0000:personified prayer) found Venus, the door guarded by Ricchezza.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_28:0.0000:Inside it seemed dark at first, but presently on a great bed she saw
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_29:0.0000:the goddess lying with her beautiful golden hair all about her, her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_30:0.0000:breasts uncovered, and a thin gauze lying over the rest of her body.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_31:0.0000:Bacchus and Ceres sat on either side, and in her hand the goddess
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0126_32:0.0250:held the apple which she won in the Vale of Ida. 4
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_1:0.0000:The proofs of Boccaccio's familiarity with the Court of Love tradi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_2:0.0000:tion are so clear throughout this passage that they need hardly be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_3:0.0000:pointed out. The resemblance of the stanza quoted, especially in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_4:0.0000:the matter of the arrows, to the similar scene in Claudian l may be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_5:0.0000:remarked. The temple, with love-trophies for relics, we have seen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_6:0.0000:in French allegory, 2 but the instances are considerably later in date
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_7:0.0250:than Boccaccio. Besides the passage in the Parlement of Foulcs,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_8:0.0000:the Knightes Tale (vv. 1918 ff.) shows some traces of Chaucer's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_9:0.0000:acquaintance with the present description, though the fact of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_10:0.0500:having already used it in the Parlement of Foules prevented him

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_14:0.0000:one of the most extraordinary documents dealt with in the whole course
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_15:0.0250:of our investigation. The book is the product of a man essentially
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_16:0.0000:mediaeval in his cast of mind, but filled with an indiscriminating
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_17:0.0000:enthusiasm for the New Learning. Thus we have a sort of autobio-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_18:0.0000:graphical allegory of a love affair, hopelessly confused in plan, full
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_19:0.0000:of absurd digressions on a variety of subjects, but especially burdened
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_20:0.0000:with architectural descriptions, and written in Italian disfigured by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_21:0.0250:the most reckless importation of words from Latin, Greek, Hebrew
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_22:0.0250:in fact from every source accessible to the author.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_23:0.0000:Finished in 1467, the volume remained unpublished till the very
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_24:0.0000:end of the century, when it had the good fortune to appear with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_25:0.0000:addition of a hundred and seventy-two interesting and admirable
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_26:0.0000:wood-cuts, by whom is uncertain. Owing largely to these illustra-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_27:0.0250:tions, it had a great popularity in France, where it was republished
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_28:0.0250:(in translation) at least six times. An English translation of the first
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0127_34:0.0500:French translation is that of Claude Popelin, Paris, 1883. See Brunei's Manuel
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_1:0.0250:book was made in the time of Elizabeth, and this version, if not good
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_2:0.0000:in itself, is at least written in a style which is wonderfully appropriate. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_3:0.0000:It is fortunately not necessary to give an outline of the whole of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_4:0.0250:this production ; but a few passages will show what a Renaissance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_5:0.0000:treatment did for some of the commonplaces of the Court of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_6:0.0250:After a variety of adventures, Poliphilus comes, led by five nymphs

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0128_8:0.0250:ings are on the usual gorgeous scale of magnificence. I quote from

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_10:0.0500:The chief importance of the Hypnerotomachia in this study is in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_11:0.0000:the fact of its being permeated with the imagery and symbolism of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_12:0.0000:love-allegory. Its original contribution is of the slightest ; and there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_13:0.0000:is no reason to suppose that it reached England before our Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_14:0.0000:Love was written. But the work as a whole is one more proof of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_15:0.0000:prevalence of the literary forms we are studying.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_16:0.0500:D. GERMAN.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_18:0.0000:pletely under the influence of French literature than was the case in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_19:0.0000:either Italian or English. As a result, it developed one or two char-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_20:0.0000:acteristic forms found either not at all or to a much smaller extent
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_21:0.0000:in the other countries. Of such forms the most individual is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_22:0.0000:allegory of the Love-chase, where the woman is represented by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_23:0.0250:the prey, and the dogs and other accompaniments of the hunt are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_24:0.0000:the qualities and devices used to win her.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_27:0.0500:the Konigsberger Jagdallegorie, dated by its editor " about the middle
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0130_28:0.0250:of the thirteenth century." 2 The author is unknown, but appears
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_1:0.0000:with his four good hounds Trost, Harre, Staete, and Triuwe. But he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_2:0.0000:has no success : the hind outstrips his dogs, and the hunter himself,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_3:0.0000:worn out and dejected, utters a long lament, throws himself down,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_4:0.0000:and is apparently about to give up the chase. A wise man hears his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_5:0.0000:complaint and asks for details. Learning that he has pursued this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_6:0.0000:hind for some ten years, the wise man advises him to dismiss his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_7:0.0000:hounds and set three others, Zwifel, Wenken, and Falsch, on her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_8:0.0000:track. The hunter rejects this counsel with contempt. The poet,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_9:0.0000:however, who has overheard the conversation, determines to try his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_10:0.0000:luck. He has no trouble in finding Zwifel, Wenken, and Falsch, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_11:0.0000:with their help he soon catches the hind. He is leading her by a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_12:0.0000:cord when Minne and her company (gesinde) come up. The poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_13:0.0000:immediately addresses Minne, calling for judgment against the hind :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_14:0.0000:a good hunter had pursued her with good hounds for more than ten
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_15:0.0250:years in vain, and now she has been taken in one day by the aid of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_16:0.0500:these false dogs. Minne calls on her son to give judgment
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_25:0.0000:In this poem the line between the native chase-allegory and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_26:0.0000:borrowed Court of Love is not very well concealed. The accusing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_27:0.0000:of a hind, hunted down with hounds, of all the crimes of the cruel
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_28:0.0000:beauty, before a court of human beings (or divinities in human shape),
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_29:0.0250:can hardly be called artistic. Stejskal holds that in this poem we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_30:0.0500:see in German " zum ersten male abstracte wesen personificiert."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_32:0.0500:High German is the Jagd of the Bavarian Hadamar von Laber, 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0131_33:0.0250:1 Hadamar's von Laber Jagd, u. s. w., ed. by J. A. Schmeller, Stuttgart, 1850 ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_3:0.0000:The hero rides out one morning to find a love, and follows his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_4:0.0000:Heart, which is figured as a hound. He is also accompanied by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_5:0.0250:the hounds Geliicke, Lust, Liebe, Genade, Froude, Wille, Wunne,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_6:0.0000:Trost, State, Triuwe, and Harre, and in the course of the poem other
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_7:0.0000:personifications take part. He meets an experienced sportsman and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_8:0.0000:gets advice. The Heart comes on the track of a splendid animal,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_9:0.0000:and is wounded by it. Wolves (i.e. informers) appear. The hunter's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_10:0.0000:horse falls lame through loss of a shoe; so, following on foot, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_11:0.0000:hero is left behind by the dogs. An interview with a second adviser,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_12:0.0000:a venerable man this time, takes place. Finally, through the efforts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_13:0.0000:of Wille, Staete, and Triuwe, and the Heart, he comes within reach of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_14:0.0000:the prey. Brought so near, the hunter is somewhat abashed, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_15:0.0000:while the wolves put the hounds to flight the prey escapes, leaving
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_16:0.0000:the Heart more deeply wounded than ever. Further conferences
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_17:0.0000:with experienced persons take place, and the rest of the poem con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_18:0.0000:sists of complaints by the hunter about his ill-fortune, which, however,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_19:0.0000:are not unmixed with expressions of hope for ultimate success. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_20:0.0250:The similarity of the general plot to that of the Konigsberg alle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_21:0.0500:gory, and the identity in name of some of the dogs, suggest a connec-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_31:0.0000:manuscripts, and there are frequent digressions. Schmeller ( Vorrede, pp. xvii f .) has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_32:0.0000:taken the trouble to extract the substance of the narrative and to give it in a sum-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_33:0.0250:mary form, using sometimes one manuscript, sometimes another, in the arrangement
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0132_34:0.0250:of the material. I have followed this summary, which is skilfully drawn up.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_1:0.0500:Of the same school is Der Minne-Falkncr? in which ;i f.u
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_2:0.0250:hawk, which has run wild and taken flight, is the object of the poet's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_3:0.0250:despairing pursuit. The love divinities do not take any part in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_5:0.0500:occur the lines
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_12:0.0000:common in the French love-allegories, the spring landscape and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_13:0.0500:passages magnifying the power of love, for example, but, except
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_22:0.0000:1 Printed as Dritter Anhang to Schmeller's edition of Hadamar's von Laber
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_23:0.0000:Jagd, Stuttgart, 1850, pp. 171 ff. Schmeller (Vorrede, p. xix) remarks that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_24:0.0000:author mentions "der weise von der Laber" in st. 170, p. 205. Professor Kit-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_25:0.0000:tredge suggests that the idea of the poem may have come from the song of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_26:0.0000:Kiirenberger, " Ich zoch mir einen valken" (Afinnesangs Friihling, 3d ed., p. 8).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_27:0.0250:The editors of Des Minnesangs Friihling quote various parallels to this song,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_28:0.0500:among them an Italian sonnet of the thirteenth century (F. Trucchi, Poesie ital.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_29:0.0250:inedite, Prato, 1846, I, 54) ; cf. also Wallner, Zt.f. d. Alt., XL, 290-2.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0133_32:0.0500:3 Carefully studied by G. Ehrismann in Paul u. Braune's Beitrdge, XXII.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_4:0.0250:One hot day the poet comes into a wild mountain region through
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_5:0.0000:which flows a torrent. By means of a raft he reaches a beautiful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_6:0.0000:meadow, and soon sees a strong castle, guarded by giants, lions, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_7:0.0000:dogs. These are put to sleep by a great storm, which also drives the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_8:0.0000:poet into the castle for shelter. Inside the castle is a round pillar,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_9:0.0000:provided with five "spiegelfenster," and wonderfully wrought with gold
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_10:0.0000:and precious stones. While he is marvelling at this, the chamberlain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_11:0.0250:appears and welcomes him, tells him that the castle is called Minneburg,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_12:0.0000:and opens the pillar for him. Inside, behind the windows, stands the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_13:0.0250:figure of a man made of glass, and above this, the figure of a woman
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_14:0.0000:made of steel. When the female figure bends, it sees in the glass
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_15:0.0000:man the reflection of all that shows through the windows. Once
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_16:0.0000:there appears the reflection of a man, on which the woman gazes till
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_17:0.0000:she becomes pregnant and bears a child, a strong boy, knowing all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_18:0.0500:languages, but with eyesight that grows weaker as he grows older,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_20:0.0000:In the second chapter the poet seeks everywhere for a wise man
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_21:0.0000:to explain to him the nature of the child. At length he finds in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_22:0.0000:Alexandria one Meister Neptanaus, whom he takes back with him to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_23:0.0000:the Minneburg, to interpret the mysteries. Neptanaus explains that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_24:0.0000:the child is love (Minne) ; the castle is a pure woman ; the lion 1 is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_25:0.0000:her sense of honor which keeps her from shame ; the giants are her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_26:0.0000:relations ; the dogs are gossips and slanderers. When these guards
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_27:0.0000:sleep the lover may enter without harm. Further, it is explained
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_28:0.0000:that the pillar also represents a pure woman : the five windows are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_29:0.0250:her five senses, the glass man her reason, the steel woman her free-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0134_30:0.0250:will these last being the father and mother of love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_1:0.0000:same manner as the Minneburg. Cupido incites the child to take
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_2:0.0000:this stronghold, and there follows a description of an attack on the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_3:0.0250:castle by the attendants of the child Unmasse, Unsittigkeit, Un-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_4:0.0000:besonnenheit, and the like, and of its defence by Masse, Starke, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_5:0.0250:Weisheit. Negotiations follow, in which the counsels of Weisheit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_6:0.0000:prevail ; the child and the lady of the castle come to an understand-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_7:0.0250:ing. The result of their union is a child called Widerminne. In the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_8:0.0250:castle, which is now named "daz edel hus zu Froudenberc," there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_9:0.0000:is joy without end.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_10:0.0000:In the fifth chapter the child and his ande go out to walk one Sun-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_11:0.0000:day before the castle, and are attacked by a great crowd of slander-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_12:0.0000:ers. On the advice of Weisheit, the child hides himself with his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_13:0.0000:company, and the castle-gates are opened to the assailants. They,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_14:0.0000:however, fail to find the child ; so they go away, leaving him master of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_15:0.0000:Freudenberg. Now that peace is restored, the child wishes to show
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_16:0.0000:his gratitude to his attendants, Treue, Weisheit, and Gerechtigkeit,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_17:0.0000:for their help. Every true lover who has a well-founded complaint
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_18:0.0000:against his lady may come to Minne for justice. The Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_19:0.0000:here becomes judicial : Weisheit, Gerechtigkeit, and Treue lead their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_20:0.0000:servants loving knights and squires before the judgment seat
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_21:0.0000:of Love, and he gives sentence against the ladies in the case. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_22:0.0000:poet himself is identified with one of these servants, and takes the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_23:0.0000:opportunity to pour forth endless love complaints. At this point
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_24:0.0000:the manuscript mercifully breaks off. So far as the construction of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_25:0.0250:the plot is concerned, there is no reason why the poem should ever
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_26:0.0000:have stopped.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_29:0.0250:be a task large enough for a separate treatise. Here it must be suffi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_32:0.0500:the raft, the giants and lions, and the storm, suggests the machinery
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_33:0.0250:of the Arthurian romances or a more direct borrowing from popular
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_34:0.0250:fairy-lore, rather than the scenery of the allegorical poems of France.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0135_36:0.0500:able. There are two symbolical representations of a pure woman ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_1:0.0500:and Free-will, and then Widerminne, the child of Minne ; there are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_2:0.0250:two castles, Minneburg and Freudenberg ; two contests, one for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_3:0.0000:taking of Freudenberg, and one with the slanderers after the lady is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_4:0.0000:won ; and finally the purely social picture of life in the feudal court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_5:0.0000:at Freudenberg gives place to a legal court where cases are tried and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_6:0.0000:judgments given. It is in these last respects that the German poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_7:0.0000:comes nearest to the usual Court of Love type. The symbolism of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_8:0.0000:the pillars and windows and steel woman and glass man are more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_9:0.0250:nearly unique. The introduction of the poet's own love affairs is, of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_12:0.0500:Another somewhat extensive poem of this class, but conforming
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_13:0.0250:to a greater extent to the usual type, is Das Kloster der Minne. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_14:0.0000:Here the poet wanders, on the conventional May morning, into the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_15:0.0000:depths of a forest, where he sees a lady riding alone. She is very
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_16:0.0000:beautiful and magnificently attired in green samite. He hides be-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_17:0.0000:hind a tree and grasps her bridle as she passes. She threatens
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_18:0.0000:him with the anger of her mistress Minne, who is a queen, and, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_19:0.0000:answer to the poet's questions, she tells him of a magnificent Kloster
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_20:0.0000:built for Minne by a wise master, where she resides, surrounded by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_21:0.0000:a multitude of her subjects. The life of these merry devotees is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_22:0.0250:described, and the size, splendor, and arrangements of the place are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_23:0.0250:told, with directions how to get there.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_24:0.0500:The messenger then rides on and the poet sets out to find the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_25:0.0000:Kloster. The tracks of the lady's horse guide him out of the forest,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_26:0.0000:and the rest of the way, which leads through a beautiful country, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_27:0.0000:plain enough, and he soon comes in sight of the building. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_28:0.0000:gates are standing open, and at that moment a company of ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_29:0.0000:and gentlemen come out to dance on the green before the Kloster.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_30:0.0000:Some of these the poet recognizes as old acquaintances, but nobody
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_31:0.0250:seems to know him.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0136_33:0.0250:Braune's Beitrdge, XXII, 302, a dissertation on this poem by Georg Richter,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_1:0.0500:Suddenly there is heard the sound of a bell which hangs neni
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_2:0.0250:gate and is never sounded except by a stranger in search of some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_3:0.0000:adventure. A squire, it appears, has brought to the knights of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_4:0.0000:convent a challenge from five hundred stranger knights to engage in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_5:0.0000:a great tourney. Excitement runs high. The poet at last musters
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_6:0.0000:courage to address a lady of his acquaintance whom he sees among
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_7:0.0000:the throng. She greets him well and presents him to others. With
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_8:0.0000:her he passes through the gate and across the courtyard into a mag-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_9:0.0000:nificent palace, which is described. The rule of the order is ex-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_10:0.0000:plained to him : Minne is over them all ; it is to please her that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_11:0.0000:they have adopted this conventual life ; Minne has given them an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_12:0.0000:abbot, an abbess, and other officers. The poet also sees certain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_13:0.0000:offenders who are undergoing penance : with two he holds some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_14:0.0000:conversation, a telltale (clajfer) and a boaster (riimser). From a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_15:0.0000:terrace or balcony the poet and his guide look down into the court-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_16:0.0000:yard, where the convent-brothers are preparing for the tournament.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_17:0.0500:Never were there monks who looked so much like knights (v. 1109).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_18:0.0000:The tournament is then described.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_19:0.0250:After some further conversation, the lady consents, at the poet's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_20:0.0000:request, to show him Minne, whom he has long wished to behold.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_21:0.0000:She accordingly conducts him to a part of the convent where he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_22:0.0000:sees many ladies, knights, and squires making love. He still in-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_23:0.0000:quires for Minne, and asks if she is coming soon, but his instructress
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_24:0.0250:tells him that in looking at these lovers he is seeing Love. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_25:0.0000:lady takes this further opportunity to explain the nature of love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_26:0.0000:how it is over all, and so on. From this comes a familiar conversa-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_27:0.0000:tion, in which they grow more and more intimate, and when at last
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_28:0.0000:the poet is going to take his leave they agree to meet again in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_29:0.0500:twelve days. So, after drinking to their speedy reunion, the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_30:0.0000:goes off, determined to return and die in the order.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_31:0.0000:The name of this poem would lead one to expect the religious
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_32:0.0000:figure to be the prevalent one ; but, in spite of the repeated men-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_33:0.0000:tion of the " Ordensregel " and the passage on penance, the picture
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_34:0.0000:as a whole is that of the gay life of a feudal court. Curiously
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_35:0.0000:enough, the goddess herself remains in the background, and at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_36:0.0000:one point the poet refers to her as merely an abstraction; and we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0137_37:0.0000:have the interesting combination of the roles of guide and mistress
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_2:0.0000:Kloster. The solitary maiden in the forest is a very frequent figure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_3:0.0000:in German allegory, and it is a mark of the effect of physical sur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_4:0.0000:roundings that the forest is a much more constant element in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_5:0.0000:landscape of German poetry than in that of te other countries
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_6:0.0000:whose literatures we have to discuss. The allegorical signification
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_7:0.0000:is not pushed nearly so far in Das Kloster der Minne as in Die Min-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_8:0.0000:ncburg; and at times it seems to be almost lost sight of while the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_9:0.0250:poet is carried away by his zeal in describing the chivalrous scenes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_13:0.0000:Das Kloster der Minne are repeated. A lover loses himself in a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_14:0.0000:forest ; but, following a sound of music, he comes out into an open
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_15:0.0000:field where he finds a great crowd of people of all nations and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_16:0.0000:religions bowing before a huge pavilion. He presses through them,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_17:0.0000:and, entering the tent, finds Frau Venus surrounded by a large
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_18:0.0000:crowd of lovers to whose complaints she is listening. Everything
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_19:0.0000:seems to be spoken in foreign languages, but later the lover hears a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_20:0.0000:damsel present a complaint in German, and follows her example.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_21:0.0000:Venus explains that the lady to whom her lover is faithless is in a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_22:0.0000:far worse case than a man similarly situated. However, she prom-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_23:0.0250:ises to do justice in both cases. The poet is then carried away by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0138_24:0.0250:the press, and goes home.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_5:0.0000:garment, and her naked feet are torn and bleeding. She tells how
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_6:0.0000:once she had refused to listen to the wooing of a youth, and how at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_7:0.0000:last the case had been brought before the Court of Love, consisting
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_8:0.0000:of Queen Venus and five ladies, Ehre, Treue, Statigkeit, Salde, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_9:0.0000:Liebe. Liebe spoke for the youth, and State took the damsel's part.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_10:0.0000:The decision went against the damsel, who was condemned to wan-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_11:0.0000:der in the wood for seven years. She was now undergoing this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_12:0.0000:punishment. The poem ends with her entreaty to the author to tell
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_13:0.0000:her story to all good women, that they may be warned in time.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_16:0.0000:and comes through a forest into a flowery meadow, where, by a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_17:0.0000:spring, he finds a beautiful tent. Six ladies are singing and dan-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_20:0.0000:seeks advice, his Heart and his Body arguing the case. Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_21:0.0250:teaches him seven virtues which are written in the Book of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_22:0.0250:after which the poet goes home.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_23:0.0000:In a poem Von zwain Swestern, also in this MS., we find Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_24:0.0000:in the unaccustomed role of schoolmistress. The elder of the two
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_25:0.0000:daughters of a knight loves the son of a bourgeois. She is induced
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0139_26:0.0000:by her sister to think shame of the affair and wish to give it up.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0140_18:0.0000:wandering he goes to sleep under a tree. In a dream, the mysteri-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_1:0.0250:The author tells how one beautiful May morning he was driven by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_2:0.0000:the restlessness of love to walk in the fields. In a wood nearby he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_3:0.0000:heard the noise of a carriage and he hastened thither to see what it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_4:0.0000:meant The carriage was richly adorned with gold and in it sat three
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_5:0.0000:fair damsels. The poet followed them until they came to a place
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_6:0.0000:where Frau Venus sat " an ir gericht " in a tent with her companions.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_7:0.0000:There the ladies sprang out of the carriage, and one of them, Frau
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_8:0.0000:Ehre, immediately began to accuse Venus (now called Minne) to her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_9:0.0000:face as she sat there. Ehre complained that Venus made so many
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_10:0.0000:people abandon her that the number of her followers was much
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_11:0.0000:diminished, and so on. 1 Venus said that she was sorry if there was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_12:0.0000:any offence, but that she was only doing what she had always done.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_13:0.0000:She simply made people fall in love, and if any lover abandoned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_14:0.0000:Ehre it was not her fault. This Ehre and her companions had to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_15:0.0250:grant ; so the two parted in friendly fashion just as the day began
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_16:0.0000:to break.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_17:0.0250:Die Minne vor Gerichte 2 is just such another poem, Minne being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_22:0.0000:Brant, one, Die Gduchmatt of Thomas Murner, 3 contains some Court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_23:0.0250:of Love features. The chapters Venus Gewalt (pp. 30-5), Wenus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_24:0.0000:lere vnd ermanung zu allem wyppliche Geschlecht (pp. 83-9), and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_25:0.0000:enumeration of the usual classical and biblical love affairs, all suggest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_26:0.0000:a knowledge of the current love-allegories. In this book, too, there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_27:0.0000:is a chapter Frouw Venus berg (pp. 186-9), which, with an accompany-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0142_28:0.0250:ing woodcut, shows traces of the influence of the Tannhauser legend.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_1:0.0250:THE TANNHAUSER LEGEND.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_3:0.0500:that palace of perpetual delights and the allegorical Court of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_6:0.0250:The points of similarity are these : the gorgeous hall ; the abun-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_7:0.0000:dance of means of sensual enjoyment ; the throngs of fair women ; the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_8:0.0000:Queen of Love as presiding personage; and a young hero gaining
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_9:0.0000:admission to all this. On the other hand, let it be noted that in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_10:0.0000:Tannhauser story there is no conscious allegory whatever ; that there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_11:0.0000:is no feudal figure employed ; that the hero is seduced into taking
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_12:0.0000:part in the revels, whereas in the Court of Love poems he is usually
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_13:0.0000:a candidate whose admission is a matter of more or less uncertainty ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_14:0.0000:and that beyond the name Venus and the fact that her attractions
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_15:0.0000:are those of sensual love, there is no trace of the classical in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_16:0.0000:legendary goddess.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_17:0.0000:This becomes more apparent if we strip the legend of its more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_18:0.0000:modern accretions. 1 The story of Tannhauser as it is most familiar
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_19:0.0000:to-day in the music-drama of Richard Wagner is a combination of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_20:0.0000:several elements originally quite distinct. Two of these might at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_21:0.0000:first sight seem to emphasize the relation between the legend and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_22:0.0000:Court of Love, viz. the Wartburg poetic contest, and the name of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_23:0.0000:the minnesinger Tannhauser. But the Wartburg contest, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_24:0.0250:going back to a thirteenth-century poem on Heinrich von Ofterdingen,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0143_25:0.0000:was not associated with our story before the present century.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_4:0.0000:till the sixteenth century. Now the dates of the minnesinger Tann-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_5:0.0250:hauser are from about 1205 to about 1270, and there does not exist

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_10:0.0000:of Tannhauser that the earliest poetic versions of the legend are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_11:0.0000:written. In this association Paris sees a probable explanation of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_12:0.0500:the introduction of the minnesinger's name into a story of which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_13:0.0250:hero was previously anonymous.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_14:0.0250:The name "Venusberg" does not appear in the legend earlier
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_15:0.0000:than that of the minnesinger, and the supposition that it was a sub-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_16:0.0000:stitute for a phrase containing the name of an old Germanic divinity,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_17:0.0000:Holda or Berchta, is invalidated by the facts that these names are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_18:0.0000:no more ancient than the fourteenth century, and that the person-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_19:0.0000:ages themselves have nothing in common with Venus. The sugges-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_20:0.0000:tion that Venus replaced Freya loses its force when it is pointed out
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_21:0.0000:that we know nothing of Freya in a subterranean palace, alluring
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_22:0.0000:mortals from the world of men. The identification of the mountain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_23:0.0000:with the Horselberg in Thuringia is a figment of the present century.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_24:0.0000:Thus we have left only those elements of the story which are also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_25:0.0250:found in Italy, and found there earlier than in Germany the tale
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_26:0.0000:of a knight who is enticed into a palace of sensual delights where a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_27:0.0250:queen reigns over crowds of beautiful girls, and whose remorse leads
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_28:0.0000:him to abandon the palace and seek atonement.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_29:0.0250:Of this Italian story we have two main versions : one, the Gnerino
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_30:0.0000:il Meschino of Andrea da Barberino, written in 1391 ; and the other,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_31:0.0000:the account given in the Salade of Antoine de la Sale of a visit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_32:0.0000:to the Monte della Sibilla in the Apennines near Norcia, where the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0144_33:0.0250:legend had become localized. La Sale represents the story as cur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_0:0.0500:The Origins and Soitnrs of the Court of J \$'
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_1:0.0000:of the wide fame of this mountain as the abode of a supernatural
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_2:0.0250:being. The journey to seek absolution from the Pope is found in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_3:0.0000:both versions, the repentant sinner being successful in the earlier,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_4:0.0000:though not in the later. In Guerino il Meschino the divinity still
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_5:0.0000:retains much of the Sibylline character, for the hero goes to seek her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_6:0.0000:in her capacity as a revealer of the unknown. He resists her entice-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_7:0.0000:ments to remain, and absolution is granted him because he thus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_8:0.0000:overcomes temptation. In the version in the Salade, the Pope at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_9:0.0000:first refuses absolution in order to emphasize the greatness of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_10:0.0000:offence, and only yields when the knight, hopeless of salvation for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_11:0.0000:his soul, has returned to the mountain to make the most of what
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_12:0.0000:remains of the life of the body. The incident of the budding staff
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_13:0.0000:as cause of the Pope's repentance appears first in Germany ; but all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_14:0.0000:this matter of absolution is quite clearly the result of church influ-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_15:0.0000:ence. Laying that aside, we have the legend in its original pagan
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_16:0.0000:form. This form Paris is inclined to regard as of Celtic origin and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_17:0.0000:as having reached Germany from the Celtic west by way of Italy.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_18:0.0000:It belongs, he conjectures, to the group of beliefs about a happy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_19:0.0250:other-world which appear very widely in folk-tales, especially in those
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_20:0.0250:countries that have come under Celtic influences.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_25:0.0500:In England love-allegory in the vernacular began comparatively
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_26:0.0250:late, and the reason is fairly obvious. The form was essentially an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_27:0.0000:artificial courtly form, meant to appeal to the cultivated if not to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_28:0.0250:learned mind, and this kind of verse in England was written almost I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0145_29:0.0250:entirely in French until the fourteenth century was well advanced. I

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_9:0.0250:of Lincoln is not properly speaking a love-allegory at all, but it con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_10:0.0500:tains at least one passage too closely akin to certain features of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_11:0.0000:Court of Love to be neglected. Grosseteste's poem was written in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_12:0.0000:French, but it was translated into English as early as the beginning
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_13:0.0500:of the thirteenth century. Other English translations followed, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0146_14:0.0500:a long extract from it was incorporated into the fourteenth-century

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_2:0.0000:of a splendid castle an allegorical representation of the body of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_3:0.0000:the Virgin. The castle stands on a high and polished rock. It
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_4:0.0000:is enclosed by walls and ditches, painted with bright colors, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_5:0.0000:strengthened by towers, barbicans, and so forth. In the highest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_6:0.0000:tower is a fountain whence spring four streams that fill the clii
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_7:0.0000:In this same tower is a white throne, to which seven steps lead and

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_10:0.0000:the green color betokens her faith, the blue her hopeful and humble
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_11:0.0000:service, the red her holy love (la seinte charite). The four towers are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_12:0.0000:the cardinal virtues ; the seven barbicans are the seven other virtues
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_13:0.0000:that quell the seven deadly sins. The well is Mary's mercy, which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_14:0.0250:can never be exhausted ; and the brilliant throne is Mary's soul, 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_15:0.0250:which God made his seat.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_18:0.0500:tation faintly suggests the other and more metaphorical type of castle. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_19:0.0000:Before we come to any genuine Court of Love poem in English, we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_20:0.0000:have a piece of evidence of familiarity with the conception, drawn
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_21:0.0000:from a non-literary source. In the Gentleman's Magazine for Febru-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_22:0.0000:ary, 1835, Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick s describes certain ancient carved
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_23:0.0000:caskets, and one of these has what is manifestly a representation of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_24:0.0000:a Castle of Love. He calls it a lady's casket of ivory, of the time
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_25:0.0000:of Edward II. " The top contains the particulars of the siege of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_26:0.0000:Chateau d' Amour, or, as it was also termed, the Castle of Roses.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_27:0.0000:In the left compartment is the castle, with ladies on the battlements
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_28:0.0000:hurling down roses on their assailants, and over the gateway an angel
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_29:0.0000:shooting with a longbow at the son of a knight, who has his cross-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_30:0.0000:bow charged with a rose. Another knight is scaling the walls with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_31:0.0000:a rope ladder, while two others are employed with a trepid, loading
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0147_36:0.0250:8 On Ancient Caskets of Ivory and Wood, "from The Analyst, a magazine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_1:0.0250:it with roses, that by the force of this projectile they may make a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_2:0.0000:decisive impression on the fortress. In the right-hand compartment
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_3:0.0000:the ladies are seen on the battlements, and over the gateway, wel-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_4:0.0000:coming the knights ; while two, on horseback, in front, are about to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_5:0.0000:engage two warriors completely armed, each party fighting with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_6:0.0000:bunch of roses. The centre compartment represents a joust where
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_7:0.0000:one of the combatants has his shield charged with three roses." *
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_8:0.0250:The casket has also scenes from Arthurian story and other romantic
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_9:0.0000:material.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0148_11:0.0500:treatment and the profusion of roses indicate that Meyrick is in the

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_3:0.0000:she recommends that he confess himself to Genius, her own ( 'Icrk.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_4:0.0000:Genius appears with a "benedicite," and in order to make the con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_5:0.0250:fession exhaustive he begins to go over the seven deadly sins, with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_7:0.0250:Having exhausted the sins and all their subdivisions, the con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_8:0.0000:fessor (bk. viii) advises Gower to give up love ; but the poet says
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_9:0.0000:this is not possible and asks for the good offices of Genius with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_10:0.0250:Venus and Cupid. After debate Genius agrees to carry a letter
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_11:0.0000:written with the tears of the lover. The letter despatched, the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_12:0.0250:awaits the result. Suddenly Venus appears and asks his name, but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_13:0.0250:does not encourage him,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_24:0.0250:There is great noise of music, and in the company Gower sees
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_25:0.0000:Tristram and Isolde, Lancelot and Gunnor, Galahot and his lady,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_26:0.0000:Jason and Creiisa, and many others. Elde comes towards Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_27:0.0000:with slow music, followed by David with Bersabee, Solomon with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_28:0.0000:more than a hundred wives and concubines, Samson, Aristotle,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_29:0.0000:Virgil, and other old men. These aged lovers pray to Venus for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_30:0.0000:him. Finally Cupid comes and withdraws his "firy lancegay "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_31:0.0250:(III, 369) ; Venus applies a cooling ointment to the poet's wounded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_32:0.0500:heart, his temples, and his reins, and shows him his wrinkled face
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0149_33:0.0500:in a mirror. Genius bestows absolution, and Venus, having pre-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0150_1:0.0500:sented Gower with " a paire of bedes blacke as sable " and some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0150_2:0.0000:parting advice to "tarry in her court no more," vanishes (III, 375).

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0150_18:0.0500:the Metamorphoses is the source of so many similar references (as,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0150_19:0.0500:for example, that quoted from the Hypnerotomachidf it may be as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_1:0.0500:fully exhibited. The personal application to Gower's own old age
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_2:0.0000:has already been paralleled 1 ; but the other features are e
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_3:0.0250:recognized. Genius is borrowed from the Roman de la Rose, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_4:0.0500:the idea of using the form of a Confession might easily be suggested
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_8:0.0000:when he was strongly influenced by French and Italian models so
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_9:0.0000:abound in the conventions of the Court of Love allegory that it is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_10:0.0000:not at all wonderful that an uncritical age should have attributed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_11:0.0000:the English Court of Love to him. The single fact of most impor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_12:0.0000:tance in considering his relation to love-allegory in general, is his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_13:0.0000:translating the Roman de la Rose. This gave him at the outset of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_14:0.0000:his poetical career a profound and apparently a sympathetic acquaint-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_15:0.0000:ance with the most prolific love poem of the Middle Ages; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_16:0.0000:traces of its influence are easily found throughout most of his works
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_17:0.0250:written before 1386, and occasionally even after he had begun the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_18:0.0000:Canterbury Tales.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0151_20:0.0500:strict sense, has several of the stock features of that class. There

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_10:0.0250:The Parlement of Foules shows close relations to the Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_11:0.0000:Love convention, though its main situation is that borrowed from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_12:0.0000:the Anticlaudianus, in which Nature is the presiding goddess. 4 The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_13:0.0250:form is again that of a dream, and the debt to the Somnium Scipionis
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_14:0.0250:and the commentary of Macrobius is not only openly acknowledged,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_15:0.0000:but Africanus himself acts as guide to the hero as he enters the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_16:0.0250:" parke, walled with grene stoon." This park is the regular Court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_17:0.0000:of Love meadow, the description being characterized by the tend-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_18:0.0000:ency towards lists, as of trees and beasts, which seems especially
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_19:0.0000:common in Middle English poetry. The descriptions of Cupid and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_20:0.0000:the Temple of Venus which follow are translated, as has already
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_21:0.0000:been noted, 6 from the Teseide of Boccaccio. The courtiers are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_22:0.0000:Plesaunce, Aray, Lust, Curtesye, Craft, Delyt, Gentilnesse, Beautee,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_23:0.0000:Youthe, Fool-hardinesse, Flaterye, Desyr, Messagerye, Mede, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_24:0.0000:others. The temple is of brass, founded upon great pillars of jasper,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_25:0.0000:and its ministers and altars, its representations of Priapus, Venus,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_26:0.0250:Bacchus, and Ceres, and its wall-paintings of famous love-stories are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_27:0.0250:just as in Boccaccio.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_29:0.0500:eral personifications such as Philosophy, Fortune, Rhetoric, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_30:0.0250:Music, belonging naturally to the type of the abstractions in Clau-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0152_31:0.0250:dian and Martianus Capella. The picture of Philosophy (Prose i)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_1:0.0500:occur in the Hous of Fame. In Boethius, too, occurs a passage on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_2:0.0000:Love which may not be without significance in connection with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_3:0.0250:frequent outbursts on the sovereignty of Venus or Cupid. 1 The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_5:0.0500:The rest of Troilus, though dealing with the same natural phe-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_6:0.0000:nomena as the love-allegories, has wonderfully few parallels to show.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_7:0.0000:The description of the heroine conforms to the type in some degree,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_8:0.0000:and Troilus finally gains his end by swooning (iii, 1092), just as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_9:0.0000:Philogenet and many other heroes do. His sleeplessness and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_10:0.0000:other indications of his distressful condition are similar to the symp-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_11:0.0000:toms that will be remarked upon among the statutes in the next
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_12:0.0000:chapter. But it is to be observed that these are all points where
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_13:0.0000:the allegories approach realism, not where the Troilus approaches
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_14:0.0000:allegory. Had it been the other way, Troilus and Criseyde would
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_15:0.0000:not stand out in such magnificent contrast as it now does, against
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_16:0.0250:the mass of barren and characterless production for which the muse
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_17:0.0000:of allegory is responsible.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_20:0.0000:First, the main part of the poem, dealing with the House of Fame
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_21:0.0000:proper, belongs to the genus of descriptions of divine habitations,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_22:0.0000:a genus of which the Palace of Love is a species. The House of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_23:0.0000:Fame stands on the summit of a hill difficult of access. This feature
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_24:0.0000:is paralleled in Claudian 3 and in Alanus de Insulis, 4 and its origin
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_25:0.0000:is probably to be found in the classical conception of the top of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_26:0.0000:Olympus as the dwelling-place of the gods. In Chaucer, the moun-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_27:0.0000:tain is of ice, and on it are inscribed many names of famous men,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_28:0.0000:though on the south side these names have been thawed almost to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_29:0.0000:illegibility. The building itself is of "stone of beryle " (v. 1184),
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_30:0.0000:and in this respect may be compared with the gorgeous descriptions
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_31:0.0000:of the Castle of Love already cited, which appear as early as Ovid. 6
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0153_32:0.0250:In some instances the costly material is used also for the rock on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_1:0.0500:William Allan Neilson.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_2:0.0500:which the palace is built, as in the case of the rock of diamond in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_3:0.0250:King Rent's poem. 1 The gorgeousness of the interior, the music,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_4:0.0500:the pomp of the feudal court, the statues of famous men, the crowds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_5:0.0500:of suitors, the dream-setting all these are familiar features in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_6:0.0250:Court of Love poems.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_18:0.0250:The walls are decorated with scenes from the first book of the Aeneid. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_19:0.0000:The Prologue to The Legend of Good Women is of still greater
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_20:0.0000:importance for our purpose, on account of its relations to the Eng-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_21:0.0000:lish Court of Love. The dream-setting and the " jolly tyme of May "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_22:0.0000:both reappear ; Daunger and Pitee are personified s ; and the Daisy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_23:0.0000:makes its first important appearance in literature. Its praises had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_24:0.0250:already been sung by Guillaume de Machaut in his Dit de la Fleur
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_25:0.0000:de Us et de la Marguerite? and this Chaucer doubtless knew; but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_26:0.0000:there seems reason to believe that Chaucer had a special personal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_27:0.0000:liking for the flower that thenceforth was to have so honorable a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_28:0.0000:place in English poetry, and that his affectionate treatment of it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_29:0.0000:here is the result of his own feeling rather than merely an imitation
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_30:0.0250:of Machaut. Froissart's Dittie de la flour de la Margherite 5 may also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0154_31:0.0250:have been known to Chaucer.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_13:0.0000:This is the first passage in which I have noted the God of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_14:0.0000:wearing a halo, and this feature, along with the title "Seyntes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_15:0.0250:Legende of Cupyde " 1 applied to the whole poem, and the phrase
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_16:0.0500:" Seynt Venus " (B, 338), suggests strongly the religious figure which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_17:0.0000:we have found alternating with the feudal. The picture of Cupid
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_18:0.0000:strolling in the flowery meadow with his queen and train is, of course,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_19:0.0500:very close to the situation in the Roman de la Rose, and even in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_20:0.0500:earlier poems of the Altercatio group.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_22:0.0000:as her transformation into a daisy, is original with Chaucer, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_23:0.0000:forms the clearest proof of the acquaintance of the English Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_24:0.0000:Love poet with his works. The description of the lady is individu-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_25:0.0000:alized in Chaucer by the device of making her dress represent the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_29:0.0000:In the Knightes Tale Chaucer again draws the main features of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_30:0.0000:his Temple of Venus from Boccaccio, but his treatment of the origi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_31:0.0000:nal is much freer than in the Parlement of Foules. The personified
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_32:0.0000:abstractions, instead of being represented as walking about, take
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_33:0.0000:their place along with sighs and tears as mere wall paintings (vv.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_34:0.0000:1060-76). There are pictures also of the " Mount of Citheroun," the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0155_35:0.0500:garden with the porter Idleness, Narcissus, Solomon, and the rest.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_10:0.0250:his successors down to the date of the Court of Love was very strong ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_11:0.0000:and in no one is it more clearly evident than in John Lydgate (1370?-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_12:0.0000:1450?). If we accept the chronology outlined by Schick in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_13:0.0000:Introduction to his edition of Lydgate's Temple of Glas, this influ-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_14:0.0500:ence is most apparent in the disciple's early and most imaginative
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_15:0.0000:period, about 1400-12.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_16:0.0500:The first poem of Lydgate which approaches the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_17:0.0000:type is the Flour of Curtesye? which shows especially the influence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_18:0.0000:of the Parlement of Foules. We have the St. Valentine's Day set-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_19:0.0000:ting, with the prominence of birds ; but the main part of the poem is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_20:0.0000:devoted to the praise of the lady in whose honor it is named. Per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0156_21:0.0000:sonifications such as Malebouche, Envy, and False Suspicion occur.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_17:0.0500:is imitated by Chaucer, Parlement of Foules, v. 276. The jewels and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_21:0.0000:One winter night the author went to bed sad at heart, and dreamed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_22:0.0000:of being carried in spirit to a Temple of Glass on a rock of ice.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_23:0.0000:He entered and found the walls painted with the portraits of many
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_24:0.0000:famous lovers, kneeling as they presented "bills" to Venus. Diclo
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_25:0.0000:was there and Medea, Penelope, Alcestis, "who was turnyd to a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_26:0.0000:daiesie," and many another. He saw also thousands of lovers com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_27:0.0000:plaining to the gods of hindrances such as envy, jealousy, slander,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_29:0.0000:lady, whose beauty and character are described in great detail, kneel-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_30:0.0000:ing before the statue of Venus and holding in her hand a bill to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_31:0.0000:effect that she was dying for love and prayed for help. Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_32:0.0000:answered favorably, promising to send joy after pain. The maiden
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0157_33:0.0500:was grateful and promised faithful service.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_1:0.0000:Apart from the crowd of worshippers who were thronging round
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_2:0.0000:the altar was a love-sick knight, torn between Hope and Dread, who,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_3:0.0000:after a long soliloquy, approached the oratory and prayed for aid in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_4:0.0000:the wooing of his lady. She, it appeared, was the one who had just
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_5:0.0000:been seen in the pains of love for this same knight. So Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_6:0.0000:smilingly gave him hope, and laid down a long series of rules for his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_7:0.0000:observance, finally sending him forth to seek an interview with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_8:0.0000:lady. In fear and trembling he went and presented his complaint,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_9:0.0000:which the lady received blushingly, but which she referred to Venus.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_10:0.0250:Together they went before the goddess, who bound them with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_11:0.0000:golden chain heart to heart, and added further instructions.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_16:0.0250:Borrowings from Chaucer appear throughout this poem with great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_17:0.0000:frequency. The Temple of Glass itself on the rock of ice is, of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_18:0.0000:course, taken directly from the Hous of Fame ; Alcestis and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_19:0.0000:Chaucerian story of her transformation into a daisy appear both in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_20:0.0000:the allegory itself and in the Complaint 1 which in some manuscripts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_21:0.0000:is appended to it ; references to the Tales of the Knight, the Squire,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_22:0.0000:and the Merchant occur ; and minor allusions are scattered through
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0158_23:0.0000:the whole poem. Lydgate also shows an acquaintance with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_3:0.0500:HOCCLEVE AND SIR R. ROS.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_4:0.0250:Contemporary with these poems of Lydgate's is Thomas 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_5:0.0000:cleve's Letter of Cupid? translated in 1402 from Christine de Pi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_6:0.0250:Epistre au Dieu d' Amours which was written in 1399, and which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_7:0.0000:has already been examined. 2 Hoccleve rearranges the matter of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_8:0.0000:poem and makes some additions which need not be discussed here.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_9:0.0000:Another translation may be mentioned at this point, though it was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_10:0.0250:probably made nearly fifty years later, that by Sir Richard Ros, of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_11:0.0250:Alain Chartier's La Belle Dame sans Mercy? Nothing of importance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_15:0.0000:ized by Dryden, is an anonymous poem of the fifteenth century.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_16:0.0000:The God of Love does not appear in it ; but it has several important
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_17:0.0000:details linking it to the Court of Love class. It begins with a May
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_18:0.0000:morning, and the description of a walk in a grove where the heroine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_19:0.0000:(for it purports to be written, or at least told, by a woman) finds an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_20:0.0000:arbor in which she sits down to listen to the song of the birds.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_21:0.0000:Presently there comes from the grove a procession of gorgeously
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_22:0.0000:arrayed ladies, all clad in white, laden with jewels, and wearing gar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_23:0.0000:lands of green leaves of laurel, agnus-castus, and woodbine. These
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_24:0.0000:are followed by a crowd of knights correspondingly apparelled, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_25:0.0250:engage in jousts, those wearing laurel proving the victors. Then
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0159_26:0.0250:they join the ladies in dancing under a great laurel tree.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_2:0.0000:with the refrain, " Si douce est la margarete." But as the sun
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_3:0.0250:rises high their flowers wither, and shortly a storm comes and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_4:0.0500:drenches them with rain, while those who are crowned with leaves
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_9:0.0000:The speaker now leaves the arbor and meets a solitary lady in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_10:0.0000:white, who explains that the first group were the Ladies of the Leaf,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_11:0.0000:and their queen was Diana. Those of them who bore agnus-castus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_12:0.0000:had remained virgins ; those with laurel had made " victorious
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_13:0.0000:name " ; those with woodbine had never been untrue in love. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_14:0.0000:knights were the Nine Worthies, the Knights of the Round Table,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_15:0.0000:the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne, and the Knights of the Garter.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_16:0.0000:The Ladies of the Flower had been led by Flora, and her followers
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_17:0.0000:were such as loved idleness, hunting and hawking, playing in meads,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_18:0.0250:"and many other such lyk idle dedes." The writer decides to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_19:0.0250:choose the Leaf for her own allegiance.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_21:0.0000:among the ladies bear a slight similarity to the scene described in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_22:0.0000:Andreas Capellanus 1 has led Professor Morley 2 to mention this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_23:0.0000:poem as merely a variant of the Lai du Trot story. That tradition
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_24:0.0250:may have influenced the form of The Flower and the Leaf, but this is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0160_28:0.0500:influence of Chaucer and probably of Lydgate worked on the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_0:0.0500:The Origins and Source* of the L'ourt of J i 5 ,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_1:0.0500:the Court of Love model, and important also as helping t<j show tin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_4:0.0500:In this work the allegory takes the form of a dream which a lady
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_5:0.0250:relates to a knight. She dreamed that a lady in blue, called I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_6:0.0000:veraunce, summoned her to the house of Loyalte, called
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_7:0.0250:Regard. Diligence served as guide; a robe of blue was provided
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_8:0.0000:for the heroine also ; Discrecioun, the chief purveyor, was met
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_9:0.0000:the gate ; the porter, Countenaunce, admitted them ; the steward
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_10:0.0250:Largesse, the marshal of the ball was Bel Chere, the chamberlain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_11:0.0000:Remembraunce, the secretary Avysenesse ; and every one was clad
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_12:0.0000:in blue. A great number of ladies soon arrived, and after some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_13:0.0000:delay all were led into a great hall of the usual type, with walls of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_14:0.0000:beryl and crystal, on which were engraved stories of Phyllis and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_15:0.0000:Demophoon, Pyramus and Thisbe, Antony and Cleopatra, the love-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_16:0.0000:lorn Anelida, and many more. On a platform was set a throne en-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_17:0.0000:crusted with jewels, on which presently the lady of the palace took
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_18:0.0000:her seat and received the "bills" of the throng. Each petition had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_19:0.0000:a French motto, "Sans que jamais," " Entierment vostre," and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_20:0.0000:like, and they complained of the faithlessness and instability of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_21:0.0250:lovers, and so on. The bills were handed over to the secretary, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0161_22:0.0500:the lady announced that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_2:0.0000:for the identification of the authoress with the writer of the Flower
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_3:0.0000:and the Leaf & all conclusive. The parallelisms quoted are extremely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_4:0.0000:frequent commonplaces, and the attributing of the different treat-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_5:0.0000:ment of the final e to a later period in the lady's life 1 is too easy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_6:0.0000:to be convincing. The movement of the verse of the two poems
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_7:0.0000:seems to my ear very different. Professor Skeat has himself noticed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_8:0.0000:the frequency of run-on stanzas in the Flower and the Leaf, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_9:0.0000:absence of them in the Assembly: A similar statement can be made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_10:0.0000:about the lines ; for in the former poem full stops and semicolons
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_11:0.0000:are much more frequent in the middle of lines, and run-on lines
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_12:0.0500:also occur oftener. The common authorship must be regarded as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_16:0.0250:connection between ihtJZingis Quatr 2 of James I. of Scots and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_22:0.0250:After an apostrophe to his unripe youth and an invocation of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_23:0.0000:Muses, the poet tells how one spring, when he was about ten years
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_24:0.0000:old, 8 he was put on board ship to be taken abroad. But the ship
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_25:0.0000:was captured by enemies, and he was thrown into prison, where he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_26:0.0000:had to remain nearly eighteen years. There he used to complain
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_27:0.0000:bitterly against Fortune's cruel treatment of him ; and once, getting
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_28:0.0000:up early to seek comfort, he went to the window and looked down
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_29:0.0000:into the garden, where the nightingales were singing love-songs. As
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_30:0.0000:he stood watching them he began to wonder how true all the talk
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0162_31:0.0500:about the rapture of love might be ; and, looking down into the gar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_5:0.0500:As he watched her, he speculated on whether she was a goddess or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_6:0.0250:a woman; and, concluding that she was human, he offered thanks
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_7:0.0000:to Venus for receiving him into her service, and prayed for mercy.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_8:0.0000:Looking down once more at the lady, he envied her little dog, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_11:0.0500:He was at his wit's end to know how to rouse the nightingale to a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_12:0.0000:sense of the occasion without scaring her away, when she burst into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_13:0.0000:song again, to the melody of which he made a prayer to the lady.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_14:0.0000:Then all the birds took up their song in praise of Love and M .
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_15:0.0250:and again he gave it words.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_16:0.0500:But now the lady turned and passed out of the garden, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_17:0.0250:lover was left to bewail his plight. Worn out at length with weep-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_18:0.0000:ing and complaining, he threw himself on his knees at the window,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_19:0.0500:and, with his head on the stone, dreamt.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_23:0.0250:At once he was caught up through the air and came to the great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_24:0.0250:crystal Palace of Venus, which he found thronged with lovers, some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_25:0.0000:of whom had died in Love's service after a long life, and now, with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_26:0.0000:the heroes of romance, and love-poets such as Ovid and Homer, \vc re-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_27:0.0000:attended by Good Will. Others, young people who had been true
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_28:0.0000:lovers but had been cut off in middle age, were attended by Cour-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_29:0.0000:age. A third group, people of religion, who had forsworn Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_30:0.0000:and repented afterwards, but had not had courage to serve him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_31:0.0000:openly, were attended by Repentance. All this a voice explained
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_32:0.0000:to him. Beyond a curtain stood a multitude who came to present
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_33:0.0000:complaints, some because they had been shut up in cloisters in their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_34:0.0250:youth, some about unhappy marriages, some of being cruelly parted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0163_35:0.0500:from their true lovers,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_1:0.0250:In a chair of state sat Cupid with a bent bow in his hand. By
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_2:0.0000:him hung, "in a case," three arrows, headed with gold, silver, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_3:0.0000:steel, respectively, and fit to inflict wounds of greater or less severity,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_4:0.0000:the last being the worst. In an alcove lay Venus, attended by Fair
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_5:0.0000:Calling and Secrecy. Her the poet saluted, and prayed for mercy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_6:0.0000:and for help in his suit. Venus answered favorably, but said that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_7:0.0000:on account of his imprisonment the matter was not altogether in her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_8:0.0000:hands. She dwelt on his inferiority to his lady, and sent him to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_9:0.0000:Minerva for counsel, with Good Hope as his guide. She also told
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_10:0.0000:him to remonstrate with men for their neglect of her laws, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_11:0.0000:neglect that she felt so deeply that she wept. (Her tears are the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_12:0.0000:rain which causes the flowers to spring to pray men to be true in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_13:0.0250:love ; in proof of which it may be noted that the birds cease from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_14:0.0000:song when it rains.)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_15:0.0000:The poet thanked Venus, and set off for the palace of Minerva,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_16:0.0000:to which he was admitted by Patience. Minerva received him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_17:0.0000:graciously, and gave him much moral advice, quoting Ecclesiastes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_18:0.0000:to induce him to bide his time, and promising him aid if his inten-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_19:0.0000:tions were strictly honorable. Having been assured on this point,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_20:0.0000:she said she would use her influence with Fortune in his behalf.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_21:0.0500:The mention of this goddess leads to a digression on chance and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_22:0.0000:necessity.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_23:0.0500:Returning to earth, the lover found himself in a fair plain beside a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_24:0.0000:river, and there he saw all manner of beasts (which are enumerated
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_25:0.0000:each with an epithet, in the manner of the lists of trees, etc., already
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_26:0.0250:noticed). 1 Within a " round, walled place " he found Fortune, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_27:0.0000:before her feet was her wheel, on which a multitude of people were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_28:0.0000:clambering, some of them falling into a dreadful pit below, whence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_29:0.0000:they never came up. When he called for Fortune's help she admitted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_30:0.0000:that hitherto he had had bad luck, but said it was going to turn
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_31:0.0000:now. With this he was led to the wheel, stepped upon it, and, just
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_32:0.0250:as Fortune, telling him to hold on, took him by the ear to say fare-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0164_33:0.0250:well, he awoke.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_1:0.0250:good. He went to the window, and there alighted on his hand .1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_2:0.0000:white dove bearing a branch of red gillyflower, on the " lists " of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_3:0.0000:which was written in gold a message bidding him be of good cheer,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_4:0.0000:for his cure was decreed in heaven. This he read again and again,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_5:0.0000:and pinned it above his bed. Gradually his pain died away, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_6:0.0250:Fortune so well fulfilled her promise that he gained both his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_7:0.0250:dorn and his love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_10:0.0250:The relation of this poem to Lydgate's works on the one hand
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_11:0.0000:and the Court of Love on the other will be discussed in a later chap-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_12:0.0000:ter. 1 At present we may note that there are here all the most impor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_13:0.0000:tant Court of Love features : the abundance of flowers and birds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_14:0.0000:and their use as erotic symbols ; the courts of Venus, Minerva, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_15:0.0000:Fortune with the allegorical figures and the shades of departed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_16:0.0000:lovers in attendance; the palace of crystal and the meadow watered
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_17:0.0000:by a river ; the instructions to the true lover, and the binding together
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_18:0.0000:of the whole by the thread of the hero's love-story. The most strik-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_19:0.0000:ing thing about the poem as a whole is the extent to which this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_20:0.0000:mass of convention is vitalized, every detail being given a significa-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_21:0.0000:tion for the individual case, so that we are left with an impression
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_22:0.0000:of reality such as we get from no other poem of the type. Even if
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_23:0.0000:the arguments 2 recently put forth against King James's authorship of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_24:0.0000:the Kingis Quair had not been met on technical grounds of language
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_25:0.0000:and history, they would not have been convincing. It would still
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_26:0.0250:have remained well-nigh impossible to believe that there existed in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_27:0.0000:the fifteenth century a poet, anonymous and hitherto unsuspected,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_28:0.0000:with sufficient dramatic capacity to produce a work bearing through-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_29:0.0000:out the marks of emotion which should appear profoundly personal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_30:0.0000:but which should yet in fact be only imagined. Such an achieve-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_31:0.0000:ment as the writing of this poem by any one but the hero of it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_32:0.0000:would imply not only the use, but the mastery, of a form of art
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_33:0.0000:utterly unknown in the Middle Ages ; and the Kingis Quair, what-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_34:0.0250:ever we may assert about its freshness and vitality, remains in form
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0165_35:0.0250:an essentially mediaeval production.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_1:0.0500:THE ISLE OF LADIES.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_3:0.0000:from being a pure Court of Love poem. It is a mixture of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_5:0.0250:features characteristic of those mediaeval productions which drew
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_10:0.0250:This island was peopled with beautiful ladies, all young but one,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_11:0.0000:and she was still lusty. To her the author had to give an account
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_12:0.0000:of himself ; but before she passed judgment the queen arrived, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_13:0.0000:with her a strange knight and the poet's lady. This knight had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_14:0.0000:seized the queen on the rock whither she had gone to gather the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_15:0.0000:apples of perpetual youth, health, and pleasure for her maidens ; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_16:0.0000:the poet's lady had come to her rescue, after which all three came to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_17:0.0000:the isle. When the knight was asked his intentions he swooned, but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_18:0.0250:was brought back to consciousness after many tender attentions from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_19:0.0000:the queen.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_27:0.0500:Stud., XII, 175 ff., interprets this poem as an allegorical account of the match
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_28:0.0000:between Henry V. and the fair Katherine of France; see also W. Hagedorn,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_29:0.0000:Ueber d. Sprache einiger nor ditcher Chaucerschiiler, Gottingen, 1892, p. 20. But
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_30:0.0500:cf. Engl. Stud., XIII, 24. On the resemblance of the poem to Le Dit dou Lion
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0166_31:0.0500:of Guillaume de Machaut, I have already commented (p. 62, above).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_12:0.0000:addressing the poet's lady he recommended the poet as a faithful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_13:0.0000:servant. The lady was well-disposed towards him. The queen now
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_14:0.0000:came and presented a bill to Cupid in which she promised life-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_15:0.0250:long devotion. The god read it with a smile and called a council
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_16:0.0500:for the next day.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_17:0.0000:The next day arrived, and the god was seated in state in the midst
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_18:0.0000:of the throng. A long speech was made by " a counsayler, servant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_19:0.0000:of Love," the conclusion of which was a promise from the god to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_20:0.0000:put all parties in accord before he left the island. Another swoon-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_21:0.0000:ing scene took place. The poet's lady set sail, and the poet, running
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_22:0.0000:into the water after her ship, was almost drowned and was taken on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_23:0.0250:board unconscious. Vitality returned only with the gift from his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_24:0.0000:lady of one of the magic apples.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_26:0.0000:The two elements already referred to (p. 156) are easily detected
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_27:0.0000:here. The meadow, the walls of glass and gates of gold, the throngs
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_28:0.0000:of fair ladies, the God of Love with attendant birds, the arrows, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_29:0.0000:reproving of the stubborn beauty, the swooning lovers, the throne of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_30:0.0000:state and the council all this is familiar Court of Love machinery.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_31:0.0000:On the other hand, the part played by boats, the magic apples, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_32:0.0000:seizure and rescue of the queen, are clear traces of the supernatural
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0167_33:0.0000:romance. The ballade with which the poem closes contains some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_11:0.0000:after the song all the ladies went into a chamber and took their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_12:0.0000:places according to rank, the Goddess of Love being enthroned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_13:0.0250:above them. But one lady so smote the poet with her beauty that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_14:0.0500:he retired to a corner
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_25:0.0500:One April morning when the poet was walking in a beautiful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0168_26:0.0250:garden full of flowers that represented to him his lady, he fell into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_3:0.0000:against the policy of concealing one's feelings. I Jut it is useless to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_4:0.0250:try to escape love : the poet must either seek the remedy or continue
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_5:0.0000:to suffer. He replies to all this that it is useless for the servant to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_6:0.0000:dispute with the lord : Love knows why he smote him with this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_7:0.0000:hopeless passion. "Fool," says the bird, "there is no worn;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_8:0.0000:high as to despise or hate a man who is worthy to be of Love's court,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_9:0.0250:and shows her faithful service." The poet is charged either to speak

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_21:0.0250:After Cresseid was cast off by Diomede, she came back to her father.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_22:0.0000:One day, entering an oratory in the temple, she reproached Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_23:0.0000:and Cupid with such vehemence that she fell into an ecstasy, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_24:0.0000:saw a vision. She heard Cupid the king ring a bell that summoned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_25:0.0000:the seven planets from their spheres. First came Saturn, described
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_26:0.0000:as a personification of winter ; then Jupiter, amiable and garlanded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_27:0.0000:" as it had been in May " ; Mars, armed and foaming at the mouth :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_28:0.0000:Phoebus, riding in his chariot of the sun ; Venus, who " with ane
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_29:0.0000:eye lauch, and with the uther weip " ; Mercury, with book in hand
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_30:0.0000:and carrying a box of drugs ; and last Cynthia, with the man-in-the-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_31:0.0250:moon painted on her breast. Mercury is chosen " to be foir-speikar
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0169_32:0.0000:in the parliament," and Cupid charges Cresseid with having slandered
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_1:0.0500:his mother and himself. It is agreed to leave the sentence to Saturn
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_2:0.0250:and Cynthia, who condemn her to the loathsome life of a leper.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_4:0.0250:This " parliament " is, to be sure, not strictly a Court of Venus ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_5:0.0000:but it is a court of the gods on a question to which Venus and Cupid
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_6:0.0000:are parties, and in which love is the principal matter. The descrip-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_7:0.0000:tion of Venus departs entirely from the tradition, all the stress being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_8:0.0250:laid on her character :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_13:0.0250:GAVIN DOUGLAS.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_14:0.0250:The list of Court of Love poems in the sixteenth century opens
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_15:0.0000:with Gavin Douglas's Palice of Honour^ (1501). Here we have not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_16:0.0000:only a picture of the Court of Venus on the march, but in the Palace
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_17:0.0000:of Honor itself a mansion which conforms closely to the type of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_18:0.0000:building usually inhabited by the God or Goddess of Love, but which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_19:0.0250:we have before found used for other divinities, as, e.g., in Chaucer's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_20:0.0000:Hous of Fame.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_21:0.0500:After a Prologue in praise of May, the poet describes a vision in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_22:0.0000:which he finds himself in a desert place through which runs a hideous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_23:0.0000:torrent. As he is complaining against the instability of Fortune, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_24:0.0000:perceives approaching a cavalcade of ladies and gentlemen, in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_25:0.0000:midst of whom there sits in a jewelled chariot a magnificently beau-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_26:0.0000:tiful queen, in purple and gold, attended by twelve damsels and a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_27:0.0000:" lustie rout " of lords and ladies. After they pass, two wretches, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_28:0.0000:turn out to be Achitophel and Sinon, ride up and explain that it is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_29:0.0000:Minerva, Queen of Sapience, who has just gone by, and that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0170_30:0.0250:twelve damsels are the sibyls,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_5:0.0000:Soon, however, he sees Actaeon, in the form of a .sta-, torn by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_6:0.0000:hounds, and immediately there follows Diana riding on an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_7:0.0000:and attended by a scanty train, including Jephtha's daughu-i.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_8:0.0000:ginia, and other famous virgins. Next he hears a sound of musu .
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_9:0.0000:and in a car of a degree of gorgeousness extraordinary even for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_10:0.0250:a Court of Love poem, Venus appears, drawn by twelve coi;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_11:0.0000:trapped in green velvet, with golden harness. Inside the goi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_16:0.0000:The account of the music which accompanies this car gives the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_17:0.0000:an opportunity to display his knowledge of musical terms and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_18:0.0000:names of instruments. Mars rides on horseback beside Venus, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_19:0.0000:in the account of those who follow her chariot Douglas shows his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_20:0.0000:familiarity with Chaucer by his choice of such lovers as Arcite,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_21:0.0000:Palamon, and Emily, Troilus and Cressida, Ceyx and Alcyone,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_22:0.0000:Alcestis, and Griselda. As they ride past, the poet, who is watching
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_23:0.0000:all from a hiding-place in the tree, is moved to sing " a ballet of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_24:0.0000:inconstant love," in which he insults Venus and Cupid. The god-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_25:0.0000:dess hears and is wroth, and he is dragged before Mars, Cupid, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_26:0.0000:Venus to answer the charge of blasphemy brought by a clerk called
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_27:0.0000:Varius. In reply he denies her jurisdiction, first, because " ladyis
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_28:0.0000:may be judges in na place," and, second, because he is a spirituall
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_29:0.0000:man." Naturally this does not pacify the goddess, and when the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_30:0.0500:First Part of the poem ends the poet is trembling lest she condemn
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_31:0.0250:him to death or transform him into a beast.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_33:0.0000:arrival of the Court of the Muses, attended by a great crowd of poets,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_34:0.0000:ancient and modern. To Calliope Venus submits the case, and at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_35:0.0000:her suggestion the author is pardoned on condition that he "say
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_36:0.0250:sum breif or schort ballat " in praise of Venus, and promise not to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0171_37:0.0500:refuse the next reasonable request which she shall make of him.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_1:0.0500:He recites the "ballat" on the spot, and is set free. He gives
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_2:0.0000:thanks to Calliope, who places him under the charge of a sweet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_3:0.0000:nymph, and he sets off with the Muses on a tour about the world, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_4:0.0000:the course of which they come to the " Musis caballine fontane."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_5:0.0000:There a scene after the style of the Courtof Love meadow is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_6:0.0250:described, and in a tent the Muses have a banquet, while Ovid and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_7:0.0000:other poets recite their verses to them.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_8:0.0000:In the Third Part the poet and his guide finally arrive at the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_9:0.0000:Palace of Honour, situated on the summit of a " roche of slid hard
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_10:0.0000:marbell stone," which shines like glass. The top of this hill the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_11:0.0000:reaches only by the aid of the nymph, who takes him by the hair and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_12:0.0000:carries him up. On the top of the hill is a lovely meadow, in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_13:0.0000:midst of which stands the palace. This is most imposing, with lordly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_14:0.0000:towers and carvings and precious stones. Here the poet again finds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_15:0.0500:Venus enthroned, and before her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_18:0.0000:By her side is blind Cupid. Facing her is a mirror, more wonderful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_19:0.0000:than Canace's, 1 in which all the events of history are to be seen. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_20:0.0000:goddess recognizes her quondam prisoner, and after some conversa-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_21:0.0000:tion gives him a book 2 to put in rhyme. More details about the palace
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_22:0.0000:are given r Lawtie (Loyalty) is the keeper and Patience the porter,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_23:0.0000:Charity master of the household, Constance the king's secretary,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_24:0.0000:Liberality treasurer, Innocence and Devotion " clerkis of closet and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_25:0.0000:cubiculairis," and so on. The hall of Prince Honor is described
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_26:0.0000:in the traditional fashion with decorations from natural phenomena
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_27:0.0000:and classical story, and the magnificence of it all, and finally of its
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_28:0.0000:lord, is such as to cause the poet to swoon. His nymph restores
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_29:0.0000:him, preaches him a sermon on honor, and finally leads him out to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_30:0.0000:show him the garden. But as he crosses the moat he falls off the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_31:0.0000:tree which serves as a bridge, plunges "over the head" into the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0172_32:0.0000:water and awakes.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_2:0.0000:court in the meadow, represented here by the trial-scene of the poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_3:0.0000:and the feast of the Muses by the Castalian spring ; and the court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_4:0.0000:in the palace, represented by the Mansion of Honor itself. 'I In-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_5:0.0000:legal aspect appears in the trial-scene just referred to. The allegor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_6:0.0000:ical courtiers are found in the officers of the household, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_7:0.0000:representative figures from history and romance occur half a :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_8:0.0000:times. Douglas seems to have been very well read in tlii
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_9:0.0000:poetry as well as in the classics ; and suggestions must have been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_10:0.0250:gathered from many sources. Chaucer's Hous of Fame* is the work
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_13:0.0000:ical powers that it is hardly necessary to dwell on his other poem of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_14:0.0000:this class, King Hart: 1 This is an allegory on the life of man and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_15:0.0000:belongs rather to the didactic than to the erotic type. It is full of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_16:0.0000:personifications, and there are descriptions (for example, that of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_17:0.0500:castle of Dame Plesance) which resemble the familiar Castle of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_18:0.0250:Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_20:0.0500:The Golden Targe 6 of Dunbar is an allegory of the assault of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_24:0.0000:ing of the flowers on a May morning, the poet tells how in a dream
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_25:0.0000:he saw Nature, Venus, Aurora, Flora, and many another divinity
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_26:0.0000:come by ship into a beautiful meadow. They danced and sang by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_27:0.0000:the river, and the poet crept through the leaves to see. But the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0173_33:0.0500:6 Poems of William Dunbar, ed. by J. Small for the Scottish Text Society,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_7:0.0250:At first Reason succeeded in repulsing the assailants; but Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_8:0.0000:sent Dissymilance, with the pick of her army, including Presence,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_9:0.0000:and Presence cast dust in Reason's eyes so that he was befooled.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_10:0.0000:Then the poet, wounded almost to death, yielded to Beauty. Very
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_11:0.0000:soon, however, the whole company re-embarked, and with the noise
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_12:0.0000:of their parting salute the poet awoke. He concludes with a loyal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_13:0.0000:apostrophe to his masters, - Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_14:0.0000:The idea of collecting all the divinities in the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_15:0.0000:meadow has not occurred in any previous example ; and Dunbar's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_17:0.0250:deal of vigor.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_18:0.0000:The Thrissil and the Rois * is a poem after the model of the Parle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_19:0.0000:ment of Foules, Dame Nature being the presiding deity. She makes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_20:0.0000:the Lion King of Beasts, the Eagle of Birds, and the Thistle of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_21:0.0000:Flowers, crowning the Rose as his queen while all the surrounding
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_22:0.0000:creatures rejoice. The occasion of Dunbar's poem (the marriage of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_23:0.0000:the king) was similar to that of Chaucer's. Both in this poem and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_24:0.0000:in The Golden Targe we have May personified as a fresh maiden " in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_25:0.0000:brycht atteir of flouris forgit new," 2 a point which seems original
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_26:0.0000:with Dunbar.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_27:0.0500:In Bewty and the Presoneir 3 we have another allegorical love-con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_28:0.0000:test, which, though not properly a Court of Love, has yet so many of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_29:0.0000:its features as to deserve mention. The lover gazes on his lady till
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_30:0.0000:he has no power to resist, and Fresche Bewty shuts him up in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0174_31:0.0000:castle of Penance, where Strangenes is porter, Comparison captain,

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_9:0.0250:before the Court of Love which we shall discuss, is too long to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_10:0.0000:dealt with in detail ; and in the following analysis many parts that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_11:0.0250:are not strictly in the line of the investigation will be very slightly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_13:0.0000:The hero, La Grande Amour, meets Fame as a lady on horseback,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_14:0.0000:surrounded with tongues of fire and accompanied by the hounds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_15:0.0000:Governaunce and Grace. (This is the only instance of allegorical
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_16:0.0000:hounds I have met with outside of German literature.) She tells him
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_17:0.0000:of the great beauty of La Bell Pucell, directs him to the tower of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_18:0.0000:Doctrine, and departs, leaving the greyhounds with him. He finds
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_19:0.0000:the tower, which is of copper, and which stands on the summit of a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_20:0.0000:craggy rock. Its turrets gleam with images of gold. Within, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_21:0.0000:walls are draped with arras, on which is pictured a foreshadowing of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_22:0.0000:his own adventures. The officers of the household are named in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_23:0.0000:fashion just noted in the Palice of Honour. Countenance is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_24:0.0000:porter, the marshal is dame Reason, the butler Curteis Continuance,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_25:0.0000:the chief cook Temperance, the chamberlain Fidelity, and the high
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_26:0.0000:steward Liberality. Dame Doctrine sends the hero to Grammar,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_27:0.0000:Logic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, and Music, who all have quarters in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_28:0.0000:establishment. At the tower of Music he meets La Bell Pucell,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_29:0.0000:dances with her, and falls deeply in love. He also gets acquainted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_30:0.0000:with Counsel, who gives him much good advice. On further inter-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_31:0.0000:views with La Bell Pucell, the hero wins her favor ; but their union
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0175_32:0.0500:is postponed. After visits to Geometry and Astronomy, he goes to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_1:0.0500:the Tower of Chivalry, where he offers prayer in the temple of Mars.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_2:0.0000:Mars advises him to make oblation to Venus, but Fortune stands by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_3:0.0250:and mocks. Minerva leads him to King Melyzyus, who knights him,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_13:0.0500:Thus accoutred, he rides forth with Sir Truth, Sir Fidelity, Sir For-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_14:0.0000:titude, Sir Consuetude, Sir Justice, Sir Misericord, Sir Sapience, Sir
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_15:0.0250:Curteysy, Sir Nurture, and Sir Concord, who escort him for some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_16:0.0500:distance. After an encounter with False Report, he comes to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_24:0.0000:The temple is walled about with ivory and is all of gold. Dame
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_25:0.0000:Sapience is secretary, and to her the lover makes appeal, and she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_26:0.0000:consents to draw up a " Complaynt to Venus " for him. This sup-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_27:0.0250:plication, which contains a summary of his previous adventures,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_28:0.0000:requests that Venus send Cupid to let the lady know what he is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_29:0.0000:suffering for her. Venus gives him hope, and instructs him to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_30:0.0000:patient and faithful, while she tells Sapience to write a letter exhort-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_31:0.0250:ing La Bell Pucell to show favor to La Grande Amour. This letter
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0176_32:0.0250:is given
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_1:0.0000:Later he meets, and with his sword Clara I'rmlem e overcomes, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_2:0.0000:giant with three heads (Falsehood, Imagination, and Perjury;, v.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_3:0.0000:upon Verity, Good Operation, and Fidelity congratulate him. Per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_4:0.0000:severance, meeting him, tells of La Bell PucelPs favorable reception
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_5:0.0250:of the letter from Venus and her resistance to Disdain and Strange-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_6:0.0000:ness. After more fights with giants and other adventures, he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_7:0.0250:finally arrives at the mansion of La Bell Pucell, who, with Peace,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_8:0.0000:Mercy, Justice, Reason, Pleasaunce, Grace, and Memory, receives
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_9:0.0000:him graciously into her gorgeous house. Suddenly Venus and <
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_10:0.0250:arrive to hasten the marriage, which takes place next da\.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_11:0.0250:Ecclesiae officiating.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_12:0.0000:Grande Amour and La Bell Pucell live together for many years ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_13:0.0250:but at last Age comes and arrests the hero. He has interviews with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_14:0.0500:Confession, Contrition, Satisfaction, and Conscience, then dies,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_17:0.0250:In spite of the enormous length of this work, it will be seen from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_18:0.0250:the outline that the material and the general treatment are far from
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_19:0.0500:novel. The poem is excessively diffuse and wearisome, so much so
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_21:0.0500:Yet the allegory of Stephen Hawes suggests considerations of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_22:0.0250:some importance. It is about three hundred years later than the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_23:0.0000:Fablel dou Dieu d' Amours and Venus la Deesse ; and from these three
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_24:0.0000:hundred years we have found still extant so many examples of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_25:0.0000:the Court of Love type that we are justified in saying that, even if
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_26:0.0000:none is lost, there was produced on an average one every three years
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_27:0.0000:for three centuries. Yet the development of the characteristic ideas
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_28:0.0000:in the interval has been extremely small. The personification of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_29:0.0000:the sciences is as old as Martianus Capella ; the allegorical armor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_30:0.0000:is taken from St. Paul ; the gleaming palaces are found in Ovid ; the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_31:0.0000:fights with the many-headed giants are only a slight step beyond
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_32:0.0000:Prudentius. The combination of these things, digressions on natural
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_33:0.0000:phenomena and all, was already familiar in the thirteenth century ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_34:0.0000:and, indeed, Hawes's poem is very close in parts to Li Fablel and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_35:0.0000:the Roman de la Rose. Here and there we may find points taken
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0177_36:0.0500:from men nearer his own day ; but the advance from the poems we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_1:0.0250:have just mentioned is no greater than we might expect to be made
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_2:0.0000:in one generation by a single man of genius. Yet Boccaccio, Pe-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_3:0.0000:trarch, and Chaucer, to mention only three, had used the form.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_4:0.0000:There could hardly be a more striking evidence of the barrenness
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_9:0.0000:first chapter, mention was made of certain statutes which Philogenet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_10:0.0000:had to sign. 1 From the manner in which they are introduced, these
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_11:0.0000:commandments might be expected to be in the form of laws for the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_12:0.0000:regulation of the conduct of the subjects of the Lord of Love ; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_13:0.0000:to some extent this is the case. The first one of the twenty, for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_14:0.0000:example, demands loyalty to the King and Queen of Love ; while,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_15:0.0000:with a transference to the religious figure, the fourth exhorts subjects
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_16:0.0500:to seek to extend the kingdom of Love, to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_19:0.0000:But in the great majority of the statutes, the God of Love and his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_20:0.0000:kingdom or court are quite lost sight of, and the rules become state-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_21:0.0000:ments of the ideal of conduct for the mediaeval gentleman, of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_22:0.0000:traditional symptoms of lovers, or of precepts for seduction. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_23:0.0000:task of classification is not an easy one ; for in addition to the fact
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_24:0.0000:that these divisions, from the very nature of the subject-matter, run
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_25:0.0000:into one another, the poet occasionally found a difficulty in making
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_26:0.0000:his exposition of a particular principle end with the end of a stanza,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_27:0.0000:and, in order to complete the stanza, threw in an additional precept
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_28:0.0000:having no close connection with that contained in the former part.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0178_29:0.0000:As, however, these addenda are usually repeated in the principal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0179_4:0.0250:and it should be understood that the groups are by no means mutually
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0179_22:0.0500:C. LOVERS' SYMPTOMS.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_1:0.0500:Group A seems the natural result of the Court of Love conception,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_3:0.0250:Group B is a collection of the principles which pervade the litera-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_4:0.0000:ture, as they must have pervaded the society, of the chivalrous epoch,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_5:0.0250:and the ideas represented will be found abundantly, both formally
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_6:0.0250:drawn up, as here, and informally expressed or implied, in the mate-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_9:0.0250:great frequency in love-poetry whether allegorical or not, but which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_11:0.0000:Group D, which is less fully represented in the present poem,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_12:0.0000:is still important, since in some of the earlier poems it includes the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_13:0.0000:greater number of the rules. Statute xvi is not properly a statute of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_14:0.0000:seduction, of course, but is placed here for convenience as belonging
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_15:0.0000:to that side of the subject which deals with the more sensual aspect
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_16:0.0250:of love. It seems to be quite original with the author of the English
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_17:0.0500:Court of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_19:0.0500:A complete discussion of the ideas represented by these statutes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_20:0.0000:is quite impossible here. It would imply not only the tracing of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_21:0.0000:development of the erotic precepts of Ovid as they spread through
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_22:0.0000:mediaeval Europe, but also a study of the growth of the whole chival-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_23:0.0000:rous ideal and its expression in lyric, in romance, and in books of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_24:0.0000:conduct and courtesy, as well as in allegory. The present chapter
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_25:0.0000:must be regarded as little more than a collection of material for such
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_26:0.0500:a study from the particular part of the field represented by the class
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_27:0.0500:of works treated in the previous chapter.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_29:0.0000:to the Ars Amatoria. The advice given by Ovid in this poem
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0180_30:0.0250:belongs as a whole to Group D ; yet in some of its precepts we find
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_6:0.0250:And here it may be said once for all, that in each case the spirit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_7:0.0000:of the entire poem determines into which group a rule should be put.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_8:0.0000:In Ovid the whole matter of winning the lady's good-will, of which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_9:0.0000:the giving of presents is a detail, is simply a basely conceived means
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_10:0.0000:to an immoral end. Thus, if a rule retained this character, it would
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_11:0.0000:belong to Group D. But in the Middle Ages, in that part of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_12:0.0000:literature inspired by the finer side of courtly love, the spending of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_13:0.0000:thought, pains, or money to please one's lady is part of the quasi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_14:0.0000:religious worship offered her ; and, to whatever extent this had a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0181_15:0.0000:sensual basis, it was still one side of knightliness.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_9:0.0000:again the lower ethical level is apparent, for while in the chivalrous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_10:0.0000:codes consideration for the lady is the motive insisted on, in Ovid it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_11:0.0250:is fear of the husband or the desire to carry on more intrigues than
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_12:0.0500:one without exciting the suspicions of the different mistresses.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_13:0.0250:The same thing holds of the rules in Group C. The paleness and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_14:0.0250:sleeplessness of lovers, instead of being the genuine symptoms of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_15:0.0250:passion-struck youth, appear in Ovid as shams assumed for the pur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_16:0.0500:pose of working on the feelings of the intended victim. Take, for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_17:0.0250:example, Ars Amatoria, i, 729 ff . :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0182_28:0.0250:whole might be placed in this category. The eleventh Statute is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_9:0.0250:tastes of the Middle Ages, we must not regard Ovid merely as a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_10:0.0000:classic whose reputation was known to all while his books were read
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_11:0.0000:only by the few. The number of translations, paraphrases, adapta-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_12:0.0000:tions, and moralizations of his works which were current through-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_13:0.0000:out Western Europe, but especially in France, prove him to have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_14:0.0000:been popular in a sense in which this word can be used of very few
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_15:0.0000:classical writers. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_16:0.0250:One of the earliest mediaeval works to show Ovid's influence is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_17:0.0000:the Latin " comedy " (of about the twelfth century), known as Pam-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_18:0.0000:philus de Amore? The plot of the piece consists in the seduction of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_19:0.0000:a girl, Galatea, by a young man Pamphilus, with the aid of an unscru-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_20:0.0000:pulous old woman. It opens with a soliloquy on the pains of love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_21:0.0000:by the young man. He appeals to Venus, and in answer to his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_22:0.0000:reproachful prayers the goddess appears and gives him counsel as to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_23:0.0000:how to obtain his desires. It is in this speech by Venus, and after-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_24:0.0000:wards in some of the instructions of the old woman that the parallels
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0183_25:0.0000:to our statutes occur. Naturally most of them fall in Group D.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_10:0.0000:work from about 1470 to an uncertain date, probably in the seven-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_11:0.0000:teenth century. This includes two French paraphrases and an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_12:0.0000:Italian version. Besides these closer imitations, we have proof of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_13:0.0000:the influence of the Pamphilus in the character of the procuress in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_14:0.0000:the famous fifteenth-century Spanish tragi-comedy Celestina? which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_15:0.0000:in turn was translated and imitated very widely throughout Europe.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_16:0.0250:Much closer to Ovid is Maistre Elie's version of the Ars Ama-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_18:0.0500:of Paris for Rome, and the consequent adaptation of the passages
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_19:0.0500:dealing with the customs of classical times to suit the French life of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_22:0.0500:which the God of Love appears to the poet in a dream and asks
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0184_23:0.0250:him to draw up the rules of the doctrine of love for the guidance of

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_6:0.0000:on education and the choice of a career, matters of dress and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_7:0.0000:care of the person, the author goes into an Art of Love, which '

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_9:0.0000:eral advice on conduct. A Catalan version from the second half of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_10:0.0000:the fourteenth century expands the amatory part and follows it up
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_11:0.0250:with a diatribe against women. In both versions the moral tone
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_12:0.0000:remains Ovidian in the parts dealing with love. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_32:0.0250:1 The work begins with the verse, " Moribus et vita quisquis vult esse foetus"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0185_33:0.0000:There is a second Latin poem entitled Facetus, and a third called Fay- or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_12:0.0250:ANDREAS CAPELLANUS.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_15:0.0000:Whatever may be finally proved concerning the personality of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_16:0.0000:author or the date of the work, there can be no doubt that it is a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_17:0.0000:product of the courtly society of the time of Eleanor of Aquitaine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_18:0.0000:and her daughter Marie de Champagne, and that its author was a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_19:0.0000:person who had full opportunity to observe the workings of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_20:0.0000:social code to which these ladies gave their sanction. The book of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_21:0.0000:Andreas gives us the theory of that system the practice of which is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_22:0.0000:concretely presented in the romances of Chre'tien de Troyes ; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_23:0.0000:for scientific purposes the abstract statement is more illuminating
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_24:0.0000:than the concrete, for the elements of the new code are more easily
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_25:0.0000:analyzed in it.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_26:0.0250:The ascetic ideal upheld by the mediaeval church could not in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_27:0.0000:the nature of things appeal permanently to a fashionable society,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_28:0.0000:so that, when the reaction came, the pendulum not only swung away
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_29:0.0000:from celibacy, but, passing the point of married chastity, went to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_30:0.0000:the other extreme, and a system of conduct grew up in which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_31:0.0000:central point was adulterous love. But to social anarchy the human
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_32:0.0000:spirit is always in the long run averse; and no sooner had the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_33:0.0250:revolt to license taken place than there began to grow up round
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0186_34:0.0250:the new immorality a system of checks and restrictions, perhaps
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_3:0.0250:and restrictions, its conventions and traditions, that the work of

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_18:0.0000:as aims in Ovid, whom to love, how to win her, how to keep
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_19:0.0000:her, form the kernel of Andreas's book. In chap, vi of bk. i,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_20:0.0000:which includes more than half the work, there are given imaginary
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_21:0.0000:conversations between lovers of various ranks, as, for example, ple-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_22:0.0000:beius ad plebeiam, plebeius nobili, nobilis plebeiae, nobilior nobiliori, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_23:0.0000:so on. It is in one of these, that in which loquitur nobilis nobili,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_24:0.0000:that the account of the palace of love and the procession of lovers
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_25:0.0000:already quoted 2 occurs. Other chapters deal with the love of clerks,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_26:0.0000:nuns, rustics, and courtesans ; another with twenty-one love deci-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_27:0.0000:sions, and still another with the rules of love. A third book has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_28:0.0000:been added on the model of the Remedia Amoris, and it is devoted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_29:0.0000:chiefly to the vices of women. There is no attempt made in this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0187_30:0.0250:last part to be consistent with the first two.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_11:0.0000:These also profess to have high authority. The story is told of a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_12:0.0000:British knight whose lady refused to grant him her love unless he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_13:0.0000:brought her the hawk which perched in Arthur's hall. After many
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_14:0.0000:adventures and contests, and with much machinery of magic ban-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_15:0.0000:quets and gorgeous castles and terrible giants, the knight achieves
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_16:0.0000:his quest, and at the same time finds attached to the hawk's perch a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_17:0.0000:"chartula, in qua regulae scribuntur amoris, quas ipse amoris rex
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_18:0.0000:ore proprio amatoribus edidit."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_19:0.0250:These regulae, however, are laws rather than commandments,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_20:0.0250:statements of what naturally occurs in matters of love rather than
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_21:0.0000:rules to be obeyed. This distinction appears even when the subject-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_22:0.0000:matter is the same as in the direct commands of the statutes of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0188_23:0.0250:Court of Love. Thus, corresponding to the rule of Secrecy, we

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0189_26:0.0500:natural history of love, bits of love-lore, some of which were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0189_27:0.0250:doubtless traditional sayings, and others evolved by the author in

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_13:0.0000:into French ; in the fourteenth, twice into Italian ; and in the fif-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_18:0.0000:many questions still remain unsettled. 1 That parts of the book were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_19:0.0000:in circulation before it took the shape in which it has come down
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_20:0.0000:to us seems to be proved by the fact that it quotes itself : as, for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_21:0.0000:example, when the knight who describes the palace of love ends his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_22:0.0000:list of precepts with the words:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_25:0.0250:where the words "libro ad Gualterium" agree with a description of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0190_26:0.0250:the work of Andreas frequently found in manuscripts of the book

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0191_16:0.0000:the substance of his codes must have been drawn from these dis-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_7:0.0000:writings of the troubadours, are collected and arranged. The author
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_8:0.0000:himself describes the part dealing with love as " le perilhos tractat
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_9:0.0000:d'amor de donas segon que han tractat li antic trobador en lors can-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_10:0.0000:sos." 2 Rules are laid down for ladies 3 as well as for their lovers.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_12:0.0000:house and in the street, to be gay and courteous, to keep good com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0194_13:0.0000:pany, and not to stop to speak on their way from church. If any

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0203_25:0.0000:the Dis du Preu Chevalier? in which the knight is instructed as to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0203_26:0.0000:the way to " haute prouesce " by the stages of Vigour (whence he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0203_27:0.0000:sets out), Renomme'e, the hostel of Courtoisie and Largesce, Valour,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0203_28:0.0000:and Hardement, to Prouesce, Science, Loiaute' and Vraie Amour. 3
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0203_29:0.0000:The same author's Dit des huit Couleurs* represents Venus as direct-

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_10:0.0250:1386) the figure of the steps, which we found in Guiraut de Calanso
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_11:0.0000:and also in Watriquet, is elaborated as follows : the knights guard-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_12:0.0000:ing the steps by which the bridegroom ascends represent the virtues
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_13:0.0000:of Avis, Hardement, Emprise, Atemprance, Justice, Loyaute, Lar-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_14:0.0000:gece ; and the ladies guarding the steps at the bride's entrance are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_15:0.0000:called Maniere, Humilite', Francise, Courtoisie, Carit^, Pite, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_16:0.0000:Fois. This poem contains also a sermon bidding the knight honor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_17:0.0250:the church and be to his friends
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_23:0.0000:against lying, boasting, and "tristesse," and consideration for ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_24:0.0000:is strongly insisted on. The inscription over the portico, against
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_25:0.0000:liars and deceivers, has already been quoted. 4 In the same poem,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0204_26:0.0000:Congnoissance also dwells on " leaute* en couraige," " veritd en

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0205_10:0.0000:the first part is after the manner of Andreas Capellanus. The five
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0205_11:0.0000:qualities of a lover are thus stated: (i) qu'il soit discret; (2) qu'il
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0205_12:0.0250:soit boins ; (3) qu'il ne soit ireux ; (4) qu'il ne soit orghilleus ; (5)

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_8:0.0000:treatments of the character of the true lover in mediaeval literature
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_9:0.0000:is to be found in Le Livre des Cent Ballades? which may have been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_10:0.0250:written by the famous Mare'chal Bouciquaut and his companions.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_11:0.0250:The editor dates it between 1386 and 1392. The instructions for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_12:0.0000:knightly conduct are fitted into the following framework :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_13:0.0000:The young man who tells the story represents himself as meeting,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_14:0.0000:on the road between Pont de Ce and Angers, an old knight who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_15:0.0000:guesses from his appearance that he is in love. This conjecture
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_16:0.0000:turning out to be correct, it gives the veteran an excuse for explain-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_17:0.0000:ing in a long series of ballades the rules of loyal and honorable
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_18:0.0000:love, which Amour had given him when he was in the same case.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_19:0.0250:These rules are in substance as follows.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_20:0.0500:To be joyous day and night, to be envious of no one, to love God,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_21:0.0000:to destroy no good man's reputation, to support no bad cause, to love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_22:0.0000:his lady, to praise " ses faiz, ses riz, ses jeux," and to be curious to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_23:0.0000:find things to please her (v, xxiv,'etc.).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_24:0.0500:To be "gent," " doulz et pbisant," not to be too silent but to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_25:0.0000:speak seasonably and graciously, to clothe himself neatly, not to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0206_26:0.0000:slander any one (vi, vii, etc.).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_2:0.0250:The youth declares his resolve to follow the same path (In, and after
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_5:0.0000:The youth next finds himself in the midst of a joyous cornj-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_6:0.0000:disporting themselves on the banks of the Loire. But he strays off
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_7:0.0000:alone to gaze on the water and think of his mistress, when a lady,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_8:0.0000:observing his lovesick appearance, comes to him with advice. She
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_9:0.0000:is surprised at his determination to be loyal, and prophesies great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_10:0.0000:dejection for him if his mistress should turn out to be unkind to him.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_11:0.0000:The instructions she offers are on a much lower plane than those of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_12:0.0000:the old knight, though some are naturally the same. Thus she too
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_13:0.0000:tells him to be "gracieux, secret, ddbonnaire, joieux, plaisant, . . .
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_14:0.0000:lie, gent, joliz, et gaillart " (Ixii, Ixxviii, xcii). But the burden of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_15:0.0000:her discourse is not to be too discriminating, to be pleasing to all
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_16:0.0250:women, and to take what favors they offer him. Persistency is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0207_25:0.0250:But the youth remains unconvinced, and they agree to refer the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_0:0.0500:igS William Allan Neilson.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_1:0.0500:In this book we have very clearly opposed two different ideals of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_2:0.0000:love, of both of which we have had abundant indications in the two
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_3:0.0000:preceding centuries, though we have not before found them thus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_4:0.0000:clearly contrasted. That of the lady is the old attitude which is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_5:0.0000:most clearly represented by Ovid and his mediaeval imitators, with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_6:0.0000:some of the grossness left out, but with an essentially immoral
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_7:0.0000:element at the heart of it. It is lower than the usual troubadour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_8:0.0000:ideal, inasmuch as that made much of the virtue of loyalty to one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_9:0.0000:woman at a time. That of the old knight, on the other hand, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_10:0.0000:loftier than the troubadour's, since it is clearly honorable love with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_11:0.0000:a view to marriage which he recommends and praises. It includes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_12:0.0000:all the nobler attributes of the mediaeval " gentle " knight, and all the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_13:0.0000:reverential devotion to woman which characterizes the chivalrous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_14:0.0000:youth of all times. It is, on the whole, the finest ideal to be found
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_15:0.0000:in the field which we are at present attempting to cover, in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_16:0.0000:twelfth, thirteenth, or fourteenth century. In the fifteenth, parallels
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_17:0.0250:are more easily discovered.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_18:0.0250:A very delightful picture of the realization of this ideal is to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_19:0.0000:found in the life of the famous chevalier who is supposed to be one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_20:0.0250:of the authors of Le Livre des Cent Ballades. In Le Livre des Faits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_21:0.0000:du MarechalBouciquaut?- we read that when the "gracieux jouvencel "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_22:0.0000:began to feel the arrows of love he became more pleasant and gracious
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_23:0.0000:than ever. He made poetry, was more careful about his dress, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_24:0.0000:constantly sought to distinguish himself in arms to win his lady's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_25:0.0000:favor. If she was present no one surpassed him "en gracieusete
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_26:0.0000:et courtoisie, en chanter, en danser, en rire, en parler, et en tous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_27:0.0000:ses maintiens." He wrote chansons and rondeaux, and recited them
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_28:0.0000:in such a way as to convey secretly to his lady their application to her:
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_29:0.0250:Ains devant elle et entre toutes dames estoit plus doux et benigne que
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_30:0.0000:une pucelle. Toutes servoit, toutes honoroit, pour Pamour d'une. Son

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_33:0.0000:que nul n'apperceust ou son cuer estoit. Humblement et douteusement
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0208_34:0.0250:servoit Amour et sa Dame, car il lui sembloit qu'il n'avoit mie assez faict

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_4:0.0500:The statutes 2 in the Poeme de la Prison of the Duke of Orleans
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_5:0.0000:are divided into two groups : (i) four commandments which every
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_6:0.0000:subject of the God of Love must swear to observe ; (2) six rules to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_7:0.0000:which the lover takes no oath, but which are recommended as likely
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_8:0.0000:to be of service. Beaute' it is who, under instructions from the god
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_9:0.0000:himself, draws up these rules and administers the oath.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_10:0.0000:The four imperative precepts are these : (i) to hold the God of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_11:0.0000:Love as " seigneur and souverain," to be a faithful subject, and to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_12:0.0000:spare no pains in his service ; (2) to love in one place only ; (3)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_13:0.0000:to keep counsel, and not to give slanderers occasion to talk, by fool-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_14:0.0000:ish words and glances ; (4) not to boast of ladies' favors. In these
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_15:0.0000:we have, as it were, the binding rules of the game, the first being,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_16:0.0000:like the first in the English Court of Love, a formal statute in keep-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_17:0.0000:ing with the feudal situation, and the others the points which were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_18:0.0000:absolutely essential if the practice of courtly love was to go on at all.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_19:0.0000:Most of the six minor rules ought to come under Group B, as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_20:0.0000:simply regulations for gentlemanly conduct ; but they are stated with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_21:0.0000:the proviso that no lover is bound to keep them " se son prouflfit n'y
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_22:0.0000:voit." The poet, then, regarded them rather as devices to help in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0210_23:0.0250:winning the lady (a sort of elevated version of the Ovidian precepts),
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_15:0.0500:It will be remembered that in the account of the longer Code
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_16:0.0000:d' Amour in Andreas Capellanus a legend was told connecting it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_17:0.0000:with the court of King Arthur. This association appears again in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_18:0.0000:some of the later prose romances, where there are to be found lists
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_19:0.0000:of Laws of the Round Table, giving the qualities requisite before a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_20:0.0000:knight was admitted to fellowship in Arthur's hall. The following
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0211_21:0.0000:group is representative, though much longer codes occur.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_11:0.0250:the Sicilian school we naturally find, as we found in the Provencal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_12:0.0000:troubadours, single statutes, especially belonging to Group (7, scat-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_13:0.0250:tered through the lyrics. Thus, for example, we have the paleness
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_19:0.0500:Later, in Guittone d'Arezzo, we have a series of twenty-four son-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_20:0.0000:nets 4 which Goldschmidt takes together as forming a kind of Ars
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_21:0.0000:Amandi. These consist chiefly of the commonplaces of the trou-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_22:0.0000:badours, but show also the influence of Andreas Capellanus and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_23:0.0000:Ovid. Thus sonnets 406-8 define Love ; 409 advises the lover to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_24:0.0000:declare his passion; 410 suggests different courses according to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_25:0.0000:the lady's attitude; 411 shows that too much responsiveness must
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_26:0.0000:not be looked for at once ; 412 provides for the lady's coldness ; 413
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_27:0.0250:interprets her glances; 414 shows how further behavior must be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0212_28:0.0250:determined by the relative social positions of the lovers. It is clear
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0213_9:0.0500:in Guiraut de Calanso seems to have been copied from him by the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0213_12:0.0000:We have, however, an anonymous sonnet 3 which comes much
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0213_13:0.0250:nearer the regular Court of Love Statutes than these fragmentary

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_3:0.0000:Hence the statutes are general instructions in morals, etiquette, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_4:0.0500:worldly wisdom. The plot, so far as it concerns our subject, is as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_5:0.0500:follows :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_6:0.0250:At the request of Love, the poet collects the servants of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_7:0.0000:god at his castle. Then through Eloquence, Love promulgates his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_8:0.0000:statutes, the "Document!" which are to be observed by all who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_9:0.0000:aim at the glory of serving him. These have been collected by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_10:0.0000:twelve ladies, with such names as Patience, Hope, Prudence, Glory,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_11:0.0000:Justice, Innocence, Gratitude, and Eternity ; and the poet is charged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_12:0.0500:to communicate the laws to all who are not able to be present at the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_13:0.0000:parliament.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_19:0.0500:such characteristic national forms as we found in the central idea of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_20:0.0500:the Court of Love allegory. The numbered commandments occur
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_21:0.0250:several times, but the virtues insisted on are those with which we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_23:0.0500:In Die Zehen Gebote der Minnef a poem of the last half of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_24:0.0000:thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century, the following are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_25:0.0250:the points of which expositions are given : (i) Triwe, (2) Zuht, (3)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_26:0.0000:Statichait, (4) Gedulde, (5) Hiibeschait, (6) Milt, (7) Verswigenhait,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_27:0.0000:(8) Balthait, (9) Mass, (10) Beschaidenhait. The virtue of " Mass"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_28:0.0250:or Measure, which we have not usually found in such lists, is, of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_29:0.0000:course, merely a borrowing from the books on conduct in general, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_30:0.0000:which it held a very important place. The poem ends by enjoining
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_31:0.0000:women to favor those who obey these commandments, and to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0214_32:0.0500:chaste and faithful.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_1:0.0500:In Ain Mynn Red von Hertzen und von Leib? which has already
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_16:0.0000:The Hatzlerin Liederbuch has also a poem on table-manners ( Von
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_17:0.0000:Tisch Zucht*') which touches the statute about personal neatness ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_18:0.0000:and in Germany, as in the other countries, we have an abundance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_19:0.0000:of books on behavior in general. From Wilken's and Bartsch's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_20:0.0000:accounts of the manuscripts in the University Library at Heidelberg, 7
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_21:0.0000:and from the lists given in Goedeke's Grundriss, it appears that a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_22:0.0000:number of German statute poems are not yet published.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0215_31:0.0500:4 Der Minne Regel von Eberhardus Cersne aus Minden, ed. by F. X. Wober,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_3:0.0250:of Oton de Granson 2 which he was translating, that instead of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_4:0.0000:usual lover's praise of his mistress which the French poet wrote, we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_5:0.0000:have a lady's praise of her lover. Hence the qualities which the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_6:0.0000:lady selects for mention are worth comparing with the statutes.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_7:0.0000:She delights in the manhood and the worthiness, the truth and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_8:0.0000:stedfastness, the "gentilesse," bounty, wisdom, " governaunce," and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_23:0.0500:Apart from the translation of the Roman de la Rose, however,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_24:0.0250:there is no formal issuing of commandments by Love in Chaucer ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0216_25:0.0250:though many of the individual qualities occur incidentally. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_2:0.0500:The English Court of Love makes mention of certain statutes for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_3:0.0000:women which the hero was not permitted to read. We have once
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_4:0.0000:or twice found, for example, in the Cosset h a las Jtuias in the /?/
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_5:0.0250:d'Amor? and in the Conseils d* Amour of Richard de Fourniv.il. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_6:0.0250:instructions for ladies, but hardly anything so formal as The X C<>w-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_7:0.0250:inaundemcntes of Loue which is printed in Stow's 1561 edition of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0217_8:0.0250:Chaucer. These are :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0218_22:0.0500:" Romance myn aucthor," which may point to an original, or may
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0218_23:0.0000:be merely an instance of what seems to have been a meaningless
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0218_24:0.0500:phrase with many mediaeval writers. The " Romance de la Rose "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0218_25:0.0500:is referred to in support of Measure.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0219_2:0.0000:are not numbered, but are given in a loose way, the same idea often

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0220_26:0.0000:less formal than those in the Temple of Glas. Only one or two are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0220_27:0.0000:actually stated as commands ; three or four others are quite clearly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0220_28:0.0000:indicated in a passage where Venus charges the poet with messages
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0220_29:0.0250:to men, reproaching them for their neglect of her laws ; and one or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0220_30:0.0250:two more are implied in the names of attendants and other persons.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0221_8:0.0500:followed by some verses which show clearly that it was the religious
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0221_9:0.0500:rather than the feudal metaphor which the poet had in mind (vv.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0221_10:0.0250:858-61).
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_5:0.0500:passages, as, for example, that against the false lover; but the list
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_20:0.0000:Among Dunbar's poems there is a short piece of three stanzas,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_21:0.0000:which has no Court of Love setting, but which nevertheless consists
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_22:0.0000:entirely of Advice to Lovers? The chief points are : (i) to beware
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_23:0.0000:of evil-report ; (2) not to be miserly, "skerche in 3our spending";
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_24:0.0000:(3) "Be layth alway to do amiss or schame " ; (4) to be secret;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_25:0.0000:(5) to be true; (6) not to be a liar; (7) not to be a tattler; (8)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_26:0.0250:" Be nocht of langage quhair ^e suld be still " ; (9) " Be nocht our
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_27:0.0000:prowd, thinkand ye haif no peir"; (10) " Be ye so wyiss that vderis
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0222_28:0.0500:at $ow leir"; (n) "Be nevir he to sklander nor defame"; (12)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_3:0.0000:THE function of Philobone in the Court of Love is twofold: first,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_4:0.0500:she is a guide, who shows the lover round the court and the temple,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_5:0.0500:and, second, a go-between, who introduces the lover to the lady and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_9:0.0500:demands explanation, and it is more artistic to have a dramatis per-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_11:0.0250:his own person.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_12:0.0500:The Somnium Scipionis from book vi of Cicero's De Republica is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_13:0.0000:usually regarded as the main source of the dream-form in mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_14:0.0000:literature. 1 Guillaume de Lorris mentions it as well as the Commen-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_15:0.0000:tary on it by Macrobius, in the opening of the Roman de la Rose
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_16:0.0000:(vv. 7 ff.), and Chaucer quotes it at least four times. 2 It is in this
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_17:0.0000:work that we have the prototype of Philobone in her first capacity.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_18:0.0000:Scipio the younger has been hospitably entertained by Masinissa,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_19:0.0000:and, after much talk about his illustrious adoptive grandfather,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_20:0.0000:retires to rest. Scipio the elder appears to him in a vision, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_21:0.0250:reveals to him the secrets of the after life and many of the workings
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_22:0.0000:of the universe.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_24:0.0000:is generally admitted ; and the similarity of function between the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_25:0.0000:elder Africanus on the one hand, and Virgil and the other figures
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_26:0.0250:who act as guides in the Divine Comedy on the other, is not the least
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_27:0.0250:obvious of the parallelisms between Dante and Cicero.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_29:0.0500:dement of Foules, after a Proem giving an outline of " Tullius of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_30:0.0500:dreme of Scipioun," the elder Scipio appears in a vision to Chaucer
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0223_31:0.0250:himself, and leads him into the park in which the scene of the Park-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_1:0.0250:ment is laid. The eagle in the second book of the Hous of Fame
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_2:0.0000:does the poet a similar service, and so, in the third book, does the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_3:0.0000:unknown man who takes him to the House of Rumour. 1 In the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_4:0.0250:German poem 'Die Minneburg ' 2 we have two men : first, the cham-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_5:0.0000:berlain, who explains the elaborate symbolism of the pillars and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_6:0.0000:glass figure ; and, second, Meister Neptanaus from Alexandria, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_7:0.0000:interprets the allegory of the castle as a whole. In Petrarch the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_8:0.0250:melancholy shade of a fellow Tuscan 3 explains to the poet the mean-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_9:0.0250:ing of the different features of the Trionfo d'Amore.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_10:0.0250:But the business of cicerone in the mediaeval allegories, especially
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_11:0.0000:in France, is usually given to a maiden. In the procession that fol-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_12:0.0000:lows the God of Love in Andreas Capellanus, 4 it is one of the ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_13:0.0000:doomed to purgatory that tells the knight the reason of the fates of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_14:0.0000:those he sees. In the Fablel dou Dieu d^ Amours 6 a nymph escorts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_15:0.0000:the lover round the palace and shows him the grave of her own dead
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_16:0.0000:knight. In the Roman de la Rose various ladies, such as Idleness
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_17:0.0250:and Courtesy, explain things to the hero. Influenced by this model,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_18:0.0000:doubtless, King Rene' makes Oyseuse, "la belle amie du dieu
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_19:0.0500:d' Amours," and Bel Acueil show to the Heart and his companions
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_20:0.0250:the wonders of the palace of the god. 6
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_22:0.0000:hero meets and with whom he views the tournament, not only
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_23:0.0000:explains to him the rule of the Kloster, but gets along so well with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_24:0.0500:him that before the end of the poem they are lovers. This is an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_26:0.0500:The lady in the English Flower and the Lea/ 8 who tells the poetess
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_27:0.0000:the meaning of the costumes of the two parties of knights and ladies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_28:0.0000:is herself a member of the train of the Queen of the Leaf. So also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_29:0.0000:the nymph who guides Gavin Douglas in the Palice of Honour, lift-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_30:0.0000:ing him up steep mountains by the hair, fishing him out of the moat
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0224_31:0.0250:when he falls over the bridge, and reviving him when he faints, is a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_14:0.0500:Now Philobone is a perfectly proper and a very friendly young
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_15:0.0250:woman, and it seems almost ungentlemanly to hint that she may
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_16:0.0000:have low connections. Yet this match-making side of her character
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_17:0.0250:leads us to compare her with the obnoxious figure of the procuress
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_21:0.0000:is that of Dipsas, 1 who, however, is represented as instructing the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_22:0.0000:mistress how to gain the lover. The most frequent go-between on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_23:0.0000:behalf of the man is the maid-servant, such as Nape 2 or Cypassis, 8
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_24:0.0250:who is bribed to speak well of the lover to her mistress and lead her
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_25:0.0500:to think favorably of him.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_26:0.0500:The most important mediaeval source for this type is the figure of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_27:0.0000:the old woman in Pamphilns* Her function is to prepare the mind
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_28:0.0000:of the girl, to arrange meetings, and to give the hero hints as to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_29:0.0000:methods of attack. Many of the later examples of this type of char-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_30:0.0000:acter, such, for example, as Celestina in the tragi-comedy of that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0225_31:0.0000:name, 5 are imitated from the hag in Pamphilus ; while others, male
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_1:0.0500:in Pamphilus, however, all the directions for seduction are not given

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_3:0.0000:in chap, iv, gives precepts of no lofty ethical tone. 1 The author

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_5:0.0000:divinities with somewhat scanty reverence (as tn his making Cupid
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_6:0.0000:serve as interpreter of the symbolism of the Panther 2 ), makes Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_7:0.0000:advise with the lover, suggest the sending of rings and verses, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_8:0.0250:attempt to stir up his courage to seek a personal interview.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_9:0.0000:There is no doubt that the author of the Court of Love had a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_10:0.0000:pretty wide knowledge of the class of literature of which his own
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_11:0.0000:poem is an example, so that both of these types must have been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_12:0.0000:familiar to him. The situation being what it is in the Court of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_13:0.0250:it required no extraordinary imagination to combine the roles, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_14:0.0250:thus to produce the character of Philobone.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_26:0.0250:The eagle sang " Venite," the falcon "Domine, Dominus noster,"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0226_27:0.0000:the popinjay " Celi enarrant," the goldfinch " Domini est terra,"

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0227_11:0.0500:distinct features found more frequently apart in mediaeval literature:

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0227_28:0.0500:Fulgentius, who explained everything in classical mythology, has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_1:0.0500:The mating of birds in the early spring as one of the first signs of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_2:0.0500:the new season, and the prominence that this phenomenon attained
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_5:0.0250:The very first group of mediaeval Court of Love poems shows us
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_6:0.0000:the tradition firmly established. The barons forming the court of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_7:0.0500:King of Love in Florance et Blancheflor are birds, and the nightingale
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_8:0.0000:and parrot settle the dispute by wager of battle. 1 The nightingale in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_9:0.0000:the Fablel dou Dieu d' Amours 2 presides at a discussion on the worthy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_10:0.0250:lover, and in Venus la Deesse the same bird gives the description of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_11:0.0000:the " horn qui bien aime," already quoted among the statutes. 3 In
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0228_12:0.0250:the Fablel, when the hero comes to the grave of the king's son who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0229_7:0.0500:is sung by a bird on St. Valentine's Day. On the same day the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0229_8:0.0000:Parlement of Foules is held, and there the sparrow is called " Venus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0229_9:0.0500:sone " (v. 351). In the Prologue to the Legend of Good Women, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_1:0.0500:The jfcingis Quair is full of the love-songs of birds. " The lytil
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_13:0.0250:In the introduction to Lancelot of the Laik? it is a bird that comes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_14:0.0250:to the love-lorn hero as a messenger from Cupid. Dunbar, who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_15:0.0500:calls them "Venus chapell clarkis," 2 makes "the mery foulis, blis-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_16:0.0500:fullest of chere," sing "to dame Venus, lufis mychti quene . . .
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_17:0.0500:ballattis in lufe, as was the gyse." 3
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_25:0.0500:We have noticed from time to time in previous chapters a tend-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_26:0.0000:ency of the prevailing metaphor in the Court of Love to change
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_27:0.0000:from the feudal to the religious. A temple sometimes accompanies
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_28:0.0000:and sometimes replaces the castle ; prayers with incense and offer-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_29:0.0000:ings take the place of legal pleadings ; and an altar with a statue
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0230_30:0.0000:appears instead of a throne occupied by a living sovereign. It has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_2:0.0250:pagan deity, but were rather those of mediaeval Christianity.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_3:0.0000:Venus, in fact, was put in the place of the Virgin ; or rather, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_4:0.0250:modes of adoration of the Virgin were transferred to the shrine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_5:0.0250:of Venus.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_7:0.0000:religious devotion towards a lady, in non-allegorical poetry. This
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_8:0.0000:was not confined to the attitude implied in the resolution in the Livre
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_9:0.0250:des cent Ballades,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_13:0.0000:of erotic verse. An example is found in Guillaume de Machaut's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_14:0.0250:Dit du Vergier, where Love speaks at length on his power of mak-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_15:0.0000:ing the foolish wise and the wise foolish, 1 exalting the lowly and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_16:0.0000:humbling the proud, with an obvious allusion to Scripture. So
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_17:0.0000:Bernard de Ventador compared a kiss to the joys of Paradise, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_18:0.0000:thought a day spent in a love adventure worth a hundred. Arnaut
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_19:0.0000:Daniel was willing to hear masses and burn candles to gain his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_20:0.0250:lady's favor. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_21:0.0500:More formal and elaborate, and more strictly entitled to be called
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_22:0.0000:parodies, are the Paradiso, Purgatorio, and Inferno of lovers in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_23:0.0000:Andreas Capellanus and the parallel passages ; and the reading of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_24:0.0000:Ovid and singing of love-songs instead of the Gospel and Psalms
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_25:0.0000:for the day in the Romaricimontis Concilium? In Venus la Deesse
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_26:0.0000:d'Amor* a bier with the body of a true lover is brought in, and a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_27:0.0000:funeral service is held in the temple of the God of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_28:0.0500:Paternosters and Credos were frequently made the vehicles of love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0231_29:0.0000:sentiments and others quite as far removed from their original mean-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_9:0.0500:Similar instances are the Patenostre du Vin? the Credo au Ribaut?
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_10:0.0000:in which a debauchee mixes the words of the Creed with regrets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_11:0.0000:for his wickedness, the Patenostre a V Userier? and the Credo a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_12:0.0000:r Userier? in most of which, however, the words of the prayer or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_13:0.0000:the Creed are not welded into the general sense of the passage. 5 It
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_14:0.0000:ought to be said, too, that these are not in the proper sense bur-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_15:0.0000:lesques, i.e. there is no attempt made to ridicule the sacred things
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_16:0.0250:parodied, but only a borrowing of sacred formulas to give piquancy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0232_17:0.0000:to the secular matter.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0233_28:0.0250:the Oryson, and, finally, the Epystel in prose, in which, after greet-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0233_29:0.0250:ings to all faithful brethren, the clerk speaks of his own life as that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0233_30:0.0000:of " an errynge pylgrym in the seruyse of the myghty and dredful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0233_31:0.0000:god of loue." He calls to mind the examples of Troilus, Penelope,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0233_32:0.0500:Polyxena, Dido, the "holy legende of Martyrs of Cupydo," and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0234_2:0.0500:that he may " sum mercy fynde, or that the god of love enspyre my

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_12:0.0000:Court of Love. The most extensive and elaborate example of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_13:0.0000:religious service sung by birds in honor of Venus is a poem already
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_14:0.0500:outlined, La Messe des Oisiaus* of Jean de Conde, written two cen-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_16:0.0000:In the work of Jean de Conde, Venus, who has been received by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_17:0.0000:the birds with great joy, commands the nightingale to sing mass
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_18:0.0000:before they dine. So the nightingale begins with the Confession,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_19:0.0000:and, immediately after it, the larks up above begin the Introit, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_20:0.0000:other birds joining ; then, in a beautiful clear voice, all together
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_21:0.0000:sing the Litany. When that is finished the nightingale leads in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_22:0.0000:the Gloria in excelsis, after which service is interrupted in order to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_23:0.0000:have the cuckoo driven out. Resuming, the nightingale turns to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_24:0.0000:congregation and says " Dominus vobiscum," and they all respond
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_25:0.0000:heartily. The priest repeats the Collect ; the thrush in his highest
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_26:0.0000:voice reads the Epistle ; after which the larks, who never tire of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_27:0.0000:singing, begin the Alleluia in which a chorus of about five hundred
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_28:0.0000:birds join. When that is finished four birds, the goldfinch, the lin-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_29:0.0000:net, the chaffinch, and the " chinchevens," sing another in four parts,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_30:0.0000:all the birds, led by the larks, joining in again at the close. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_31:0.0000:blackbird reads the Gospels ; the nightingale repeats the Creed ; and,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0235_32:0.0250:after the singing of the Offertory, the parrot preaches the sermon
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_1:0.0250:which has already been described, 1 and absolution is bestowed. Just
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_2:0.0000:as all the lovers fall on their knees, the cuckoo comes flying over, cry-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_3:0.0000:ing " Tout cuku " and causing great indignation. When they have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_4:0.0000:returned from pursuing the scoffer, the nightingale begins the Preface,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_5:0.0000:and the Sanctus is sung. The priest devoutly elevates a beautiful
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_6:0.0000:red rose, surpassing all flowers in beauty, perfume, and size, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_7:0.0000:then lowers it again. The Paternoster is chanted and the Agnus
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_8:0.0000:Dei follows. The priest wishes the dove to bring the "peace,"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_9:0.0000:and he brings in his bill a green rush, from which comes a great
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_10:0.0000:sweetness. From the rose the priest takes three leaves, which he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_11:0.0000:uses to perform cures, yet the rose remains entire. Then with wine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_12:0.0000:and water in a chalice the remaining ceremonies are duly performed ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_13:0.0000:all sing the Postcommunion ; the nightingale says the closing Col-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_14:0.0000:lect, and the blackbird " Ite missa est.." The other birds reply
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_15:0.0250:with Deo gratias, the priest pronounces the Benediction, " et a dit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_17:0.0500:Very similar to this, though much shorter, is the poem by Lydgate,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_18:0.0000:the Devotions of the Fowles? The poet walks out in the sunshine
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_19:0.0000:and hears the popinjay sing the Nativity (" A solis ortus cardine "),
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_20:0.0000:the pelican the Redemption (" Vexilla regis prodeurtf "), the night-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_21:0.0000:ingale the Resurrection (" Consurgat Christus tumulo "), the lark
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_22:0.0000:the Ascension (" Eterne rex altissime "), the dove " Veni Creator
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_23:0.0000:Spiritus," and all the birds together " O lux beata Trinitas."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_25:0.0250:without proof, to Skelton, may be later than the English Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0236_26:0.0250:Love. Here the author goes out on an April morning and sees on

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_11:0.0500:hints of the same idea in short passages. Thus in the Cuckoo and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_21:0.0000:Thus it appears that, though the different elements which are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_22:0.0000:present in the Birds' Matins at the end of the English Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_23:0.0000:(the association of Birds with Venus, and the custom of parodying
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_24:0.0000:church services) were common enough in both French and English ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_25:0.0000:poetry, the combination of the two is found elaborately worked out
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_26:0.0000:only, so far as I can discover, in the Messe des Oisiaus. The poet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_27:0.0000:of the Court of Love may, of course, have worked it up from such
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_28:0.0000:hints as hare been quoted from Clanvowe and Dunbar, or he may
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_29:0.0000:have combined the two elements for himself; but in view of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_30:0.0000:fact that he, like other mediaeval poets, seldom invented when he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_31:0.0500:could imitate, it is more than probable that the source of the last
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0237_32:0.0250:section of our poem is to be found in Jean de Conde.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_2:0.0500:THE IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF THE COURT OF LOVE.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_3:0.0250:THE foregoing chapters have furnished in considerable detail the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_4:0.0000:means of realizing the extent to which the main features of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_5:0.0250:Court of Love were prevalent in the love-allegory of Western Europe
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_6:0.0000:for at least three centuries before the English poem was written.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_7:0.0000:Certain of these features have proved to be so common that it is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_8:0.0000:useless to regard them as in themselves means of proving any im-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_9:0.0000:mediate relation to any particular source or sources. Thus, such
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_10:0.0000:conceptions as that of Venus or Cupid holding a court in which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_11:0.0000:courtiers, either allegorical personages or the ghosts of famous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_12:0.0000:lovers, form the retinue of the divinity ; a temple of Venus in which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_13:0.0000:lovers offer sacrifices and prayers ; the gorgeous palace of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_14:0.0000:goddess ; the decoration of walls with love-stories ; the description
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_15:0.0000:of the mediaeval type of female beauty (with golden hair, laughing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_16:0.0000:eyes, red lips, fair skin, even teeth, slender figure, and so on) ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_17:0.0000:the May-morning landscape, with streams and flowers and birds;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_18:0.0000:the presenting of " complaints " and " bills " ; the nymph who acts
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_19:0.0000:as guide and interpreter ; with a score of minor details such con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_20:0.0250:ceptions occurring in any two poems tell nothing whatever about
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_21:0.0500:the immediate relations of these poems.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_22:0.0500:It is necessary, therefore, if we are to prove anything with regard
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_23:0.0000:to those sources which actually suggested certain features of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_24:0.0000:Court of Love, to find either striking parallelisms in detail which can-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_25:0.0000:not be set aside as commonplaces, or the presence of some distinct
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_26:0.0000:feature which in itself is not a regular part of poems of the type.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_27:0.0000:What has been said of commonplaces in general may be said
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_28:0.0000:almost as strongly of the main features of the Roman de la Rose.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_29:0.0000:A direct knowledge of that poem by any later mediaeval author is to be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_30:0.0000:presumed almost as certainly as a knowledge of the Bible ; and even
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_31:0.0000:though a writer had not himself read the book, its influence would
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_32:0.0000:still appear in his work if he followed the allegorical tradition at all.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0238_33:0.0250:And this tradition, it has sufficiently appeared, every allegorist did
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_3:0.0500:The evidence in the case of Chaucer's influence is more tangible ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_4:0.0000:and this influence was both mediate and immediate. Lydgate was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_5:0.0000:a professed disciple, and he, for one, can be proved as an intermediary
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_6:0.0000:for the indirect influence. But there abound in the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_7:0.0000:phrases which recall Chaucerian phrases, and it is not possible to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_8:0.0000:determine whether these came directly from the master himself, or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_9:0.0250:whether the Court of Love poet got them from one of his numerous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_10:0.0250:imitators. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_24:0.0250:The last phrase is decisive. Alcestis is by no means a rare figure
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_25:0.0250:in mediaeval poetry, 2 though of much more frequent occurrence after
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_26:0.0000:Chaucer than before, and she is mentioned by Lydgate in the Tem-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_27:0.0000:ple of Glas without any reference to the nineteen ladies. This num-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_28:0.0000:ber indicates a clear reference to the Prologue of the Legend of Good
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_29:0.0500:Women, as also does the important role assigned Alcestis as Queen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0239_30:0.0500:of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_1:0.0500:The part played by Pity in the Court of Love is pretty certainly also
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_2:0.0000:due to Chaucer's influence. It will be remembered that Philogenet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_3:0.0000:notices (vv. 693 if.) in the Temple of Love a jewelled shrine where,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_4:0.0000:Philobone tells him, " a tender creature is shryned . . . and Pite is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_5:0.0000:her name." She had seen an eagle " wreke him on a fly " and had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_6:0.0000:died of tender heart. Since then lovers had been ill-off, and only
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_7:0.0000:" hot corage spedeth the maters all of court " now. Here a reflec-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_8:0.0000:tion seems to be cast on the ways of women as degenerate, and it is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_9:0.0000:natural that, when it is necessary to have Rosial relent, the author
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_10:0.0250:should want to make her do so from the more womanly motive. So
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0240_11:0.0500:he brings Pity to life again.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_1:0.0250:The situation in Chaucer's Compleynte unto Pite, moreover, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_10:0.0000:Around her hearse stood Bounty, Fresh Beauty, Lust, Jollity, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_11:0.0250:others " withouten any wo " and "confedred alle by bonde of Cruel-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_12:0.0000:tee " (v. 52). The bill he had written to present to Pity follows,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_13:0.0000:and, though purporting to have been written before she died, it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_14:0.0000:contains a reference to her death (v. 117). There is no resuscita-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_15:0.0000:tion here ; but it seems fair to suppose that the Court of Love author
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_16:0.0250:borrowed the idea of the shrine, and had the further development
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0241_17:0.0000:suggested by the circumstances in his own poem.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_1:0.0500:Venus have had some one who came before the goddess with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_2:0.0000:grievance. But this elaborate description of the various classes of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_3:0.0000:suitors and their causes of complaint seems to be the invention of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_4:0.0250:Lydgate, from whom both James I. of Scots and the author of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_5:0.0000:Court of Love borrowed it. In the following table I have selected
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_6:0.0000:from the Temple of Glas, in which the list is by far the longest, those
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_7:0.0000:classes that are paralleled in either of the other poems. In all three
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_8:0.0000:cases the description of the complainants is introduced by mention
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_9:0.0250:of famous lovers. In Lydgate and the Court of Love these are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_10:0.0250:painted on walls or windows, and in both Dido's is the first name ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_30:0.0000:others peculiar to itself, natural developments according to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_31:0.0000:poet's individual fancy, easy enough after the general idea was once
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_32:0.0000:seized. It is to be noticed, however, that the only point common to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_33:0.0000:the two later poems and absent from Lydgate is that of the loss of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0242_34:0.0000:the lover by death ; and this is too familiar an idea to serve as any
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0243_0:0.0500:The Origins and Sources of the Court of Love. 233
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_22:0.0500:on the two others is clearly manifest, there is no trace of the depend-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_24:0.0250:Once the point is granted that the author of the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_25:0.0000:knew the Temple of Gtas, many parallels in detail become significant,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_26:0.0000:and it would not be hard to draw up lists of these to show that there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_27:0.0000:is a strong presumption that it was from Lydgate that the author got
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_28:0.0000:his main outline, as well as the minor points specified. But material
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_29:0.0000:for such a comparison has already been supplied in the analyses
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_30:0.0250:given of the two poems, and it seems hardly worth while to insist
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0244_31:0.0000:further on a matter already sufficiently proved.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_1:0.0250:the Court of Love. We have noticed that in that poem Philogenet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_2:0.0000:makes two distinct rounds of sightseeing in the Court, and there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_3:0.0000:does not seem to be any good reason in the nature of the plot for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_4:0.0250:this duplication. Now in the Temple of Glas Lydgate also intro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_5:0.0000:duces a second description, beginning at v. 531. This, however, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_6:0.0000:easily accounted for. The first description is introductory to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_7:0.0000:account of the heroine ; the second to that of the hero ; and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_8:0.0000:duplication does not strike the reader as at all out of place. But
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_9:0.0000:in the Court of Love the author himself is the hero and is not
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_10:0.0000:described from the outside at all. Does it not seem possible that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_11:0.0000:the Court of Love poet was here somewhat unintelligent in his imita-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_12:0.0250:tion, as mediaeval imitators often enough were, and copied this bit of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_13:0.0000:machinery without supplying the proper motive for its existence?
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_14:0.0000:Did the author of the Court of Love know the Kingis Quair?
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_15:0.0000:Mr. J. T. T. Brown says no, because, as he holds, the author of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_16:0.0000:Kingis Quair copied the Court of Love. But his denial of James
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_17:0.0000:I.'s authorship of the Scottish poem has been sufficiently disproved
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_18:0.0250:by M. Jusserand. 1 The Court of Love was written more than half
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_19:0.0000:a century at least after James's death. Yet Mr. Brown's parallels, 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_20:0.0000:in spite of his protests, work equally well either way ; and we have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_21:0.0000:to consider whether they prove anything with regard to an immedi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_22:0.0000:ate relation between the two poems at all. The majority of these
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_23:0.0000:parallels, it is clear to any one acquainted with the mass of mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_24:0.0000:poetry of this sort it would be clear merely from the material
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_25:0.0000:collected in our third chapter are simply mediaeval commonplaces;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_26:0.0000:a criticism which Mr. Brown anticipated but did not forestall. 3
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_27:0.0000:Others are due to a common knowledge of Chaucer. The most
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_28:0.0000:important arise from the fact just proved, that both used the Temple
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_29:0.0250:of Glas as a model. Of the existence of this poem of Lydgate's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_30:0.0500:Mr. Brown does not seem to have been aware, unfortunately, it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_34:0.0250:Glasgow, 1896; and cf. Henry Wood, Chaucer's Influence upon James /., Halle,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0245_36:0.0250:1887.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_4:0.0000:poems. The very fact that both authors were diligent students of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_5:0.0000:Chaucer and Lydgate, while on the one hand it would tend to lead
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_6:0.0000:us to draw false inferences as to the influence of the one on the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_7:0.0000:other, would on the other hand tend to cover up traces of such an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_8:0.0000:influence, had it really existed. The examination of the passages
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_9:0.0000:on the classes of complainants failed to produce any clear evidence.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_10:0.0000:A comparison of the statutes is almost as barren. The first statute
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_11:0.0000:of the Court of Love indeed, demanding truth to the King and Queen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_12:0.0000:of Love, which we did not find in the regular tradition of the stat-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_13:0.0000:utes, and which is not formerly stated by Lydgate, is represented in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_14:0.0250:the Kingis Quair by Venus's tearful protest against the desertion of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_29:0.0250:Another argument is suggested by Professor Skeat who " admits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_30:0.0000:the certainty " that he [the author of the Court of Love] consulted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_31:0.0000:the Kingis Quair. He thinks the metre suggests Scottish influence,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_32:0.0000:and draws attention to the use of " celsitude " and " pulcritude,"
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_33:0.0000:rhyming together, as possibly due to the same source. Yet these
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_34:0.0250:peculiarities might be owing to the influence of other Scottish poets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0246_35:0.0250:than James I.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_0:0.0500:The Origins and Sources of the Court of Love. 237
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_1:0.0500:Thus it seems possible that we should reckon the Kingis
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_3:0.0000:in favor of it is not conclusive, there is no important obstacle to it,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_5:0.0250:With regard to the relation of Court of Love to the Poeme de la
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_6:0.0000:Prison of Charles d'Orle'ans the case is somewhat similar though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_7:0.0000:hardly so strong. The presence of Charles in England, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_8:0.0000:existence of an English translation of at least part of the Poeme de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_9:0.0000:la Prison increase the chances of his work's being known to an Eng-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_10:0.0250:lish poet. Charles is one of the comparatively few Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_11:0.0000:poets who actually numbered his statutes, and it is remarkable that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_12:0.0000:the somewhat rare Statute I which was found in the English Court
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_13:0.0000:of Love and also in the Kingis Quair is the first of the command-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_14:0.0000:ments in the Poeme de la Prison. This, however, is the most definite
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_15:0.0000:point apart from features that are too widely spread to be available
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_16:0.0000:as evidence. There are coincidences in the classical examples
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_17:0.0000:quoted (Dido, for example, and Alcestis), but these alone prove
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0247_18:0.0250:nothing.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0248_11:0.0250:Professor Skeat has pointed out, Jupiter's intrigues with Europa,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0248_12:0.0500:Antiope, Alcmene and Danae, which are alluded to in the Court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0248_13:0.0500:Love (vv. 820-4), are a l so mentioned all together in Met., vi, 103-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_1:0.0000:author. The only other instance I have found of this figure used of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_2:0.0000:a woman's beauty is in the following lines from the Architreniu*. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_3:0.0000:The application is quite different, but it is just possible that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_4:0.0000:line in the Court of Love is the result of some such passage imper-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_5:0.0000:fectly remembered. The lines occur in the description of the most
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_14:0.0500:To sum up. The author of the Court of Love was most influenced
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_15:0.0000:by Chaucer and Lydgate. The poems by the former which are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_16:0.0000:most used by him are the Legend of Good Women, Parlement of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_17:0.0000:Foules, Hous of Fame, and Compleynt to Pity. Troilus and Criseyde
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_18:0.0000:is frequently recalled by single lines, and by such episodes as the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_19:0.0000:swooning of Philogenet. The Bok of the Duchesse may have sug-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_20:0.0000:gested the painted windows near the beginning of the Court of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_21:0.0000:but the device is common. Occasional verses show a knowledge of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_22:0.0500:at least some of the Canterbury Tales. The total result gives the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_23:0.0500:impression of a very devoted disciple.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_24:0.0000:Of Lydgate's works The Temple of Glas has had, of course, by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_25:0.0000:far the greatest influence on our author; and the lines proving
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_26:0.0000:a knowledge of one of his ballades have been quoted. Professor
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_27:0.0000:Skeat quotes occasional parallels that make it probable that he was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_28:0.0000:not unacquainted with other works of Lydgate. With fair assurance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_29:0.0000:we may say that he had read Ovid and Maximian, and that he knew
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_30:0.0000:La Messe des Oisiaus of Jean de Condd. The evidence with regard
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_31:0.0000:to Charles d'Orldans and James I. of Scots is inconclusive. In addi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_32:0.0000:tion to all this we may feel sure that he knew other poems of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0249_33:0.0250:Court of Love type, and doubtless received from them hints for his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_3:0.0000:Professor Skeat thinks that the coining of the names Philogenet
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_4:0.0000:and Philobone points to the author's being a disciple of the New
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_5:0.0000:Learning. But these names seem to be rather mediaeval than
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_6:0.0000:modern in the kind of scholarship they suggest. " Philogenet," I
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_7:0.0000:presume, means "a lover born," and "Philobone," probably, "good
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_8:0.0000:to lovers " ; and such a hybrid as the latter would lead one to be-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_9:0.0000:lieve that the "clerk of Cambridge" (v. 913) was more interested
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_10:0.0250:in making his " art of love " and songs " in honour of the King and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_11:0.0000:Quene of Love " (vv. 897-9) than in reviving the study of Greek.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_15:0.0250:THE RELATION OF THE ALLEGORY TO THE INSTITUTION
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_17:0.0250:THE debate (debat~) as a literary form appears very early in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_18:0.0250:mediaeval literature. According to Ebert, 1 the chief influence which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_19:0.0000:moulded its development was that of the classical eclogue. Yet the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_20:0.0000:dialogue is a very natural form for any one to adopt who wishes to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_21:0.0000:make a show of presenting both sides of an argument, and it might
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_22:0.0250:quite conceivably be used by writers who knew nothing of the clas-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0250_23:0.0500:sical tradition.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_1:0.0250:of the Psychomachia appears in a Latin life of St. Christopher, 1 in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_2:0.0000:which the author represents Pudicitia and Libido as taking the forms
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_3:0.0000:of two women, and disputing with each other in Christopher's prison.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_4:0.0000:Such discussions became favorite clerkly exercises, and commonly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_5:0.0250:took a didactic turn. They are represented in English by such poems
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_6:0.0500:as the Debate of the Body and the Sou!, and, in a different field, 734*
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_7:0.0000:Owl and the Nightingale. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_8:0.0250:The introduction of love into these debates was only a matter of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_9:0.0000:time ; and we are not surprised to find " ddbats d'amour " among the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_10:0.0000:very earliest specimens of mediaeval amorous poetry. The Ronmri-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_11:0.0000:cimontis Concilium 5 is, of course, a debate, and the subject there dis-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_12:0.0000:cussed, the comparative merits of knights and clerks as lovers, we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_13:0.0000:have traced through the whole series of poems of the Altercatio type
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_14:0.0000:down to the sixteenth-century farce played between the young monk
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_15:0.0000:and the old soldier. 4 In the first of these the Court of Love element
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_16:0.0000:is quite subordinate, appearing, indeed, only in the lady cardinal's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_17:0.0000:announcement that she is sent by the God of Love ; in Florance et
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_18:0.0250:Blancheflor, the god and his barons are introduced as a court of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_19:0.0250:appeal, but the debate is still the main point of interest.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_20:0.0250:The growth of this kind of discussion is shown in the Fablel dou
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_21:0.0000:Dieu d 'Amours? in which the nightingale calls the other birds round
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_22:0.0000:him and complains that love has degenerated. The hawk lays the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_23:0.0000:blame on the "villaine gent," but the thrush objects to the hawk's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_24:0.0000:confining love to clerks and knights ; while the jay thinks that to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_25:0.0250:love and be well loved is to be as worthy and wise as a clerk, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_26:0.0000:to be indeed a " chevalier d'amour."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_27:0.0500:By the fourteenth century we find the love-debate a familiar type.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_28:0.0000:Guillaume de Machaut wrote a Jugement du Roi de Behaigne? in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_29:0.0250:which he represents himself as overhearing a dispute between a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_30:0.0250:dejected lady and an equally dejected knight, as to which is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0251_31:0.0250:more unfortunate. The lady has lost her lover by death ; the knight's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_1:0.0500:mistress has given her heart to another. Machaut intervenes and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_2:0.0000:proposes the king of Bohemia as arbiter. The suggestion is adopted,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_4:0.0000:Machaut's patroness was displeased at t^is conclusion ; so he
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_5:0.0250:wrote a Jugement du Roi de Navarre (Nov. I349). 1 Here the dis-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_6:0.0000:cussion is between a beautiful lady and the poet on the justice of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_7:0.0000:the king of Bohemia's decision, and the arbiter chosen this time is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_8:0.0250:Charles the Bad of Navarre. The poet loses, and is condemned
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_9:0.0250:to write some chansons.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_14:0.0000:her affections on a second, more sincere. Is she therefore perjured ?
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_15:0.0000:2. A knight has lost all hope of seeing his mistress again, since a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_16:0.0000:jealous husband has shut her up in prison. May he, after an interval,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_17:0.0000:seek a new love ? 3. A damsel is deserted by a knight, who transfers
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_18:0.0000:his addresses to a powerful dame, who repulses him. The knight
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_19:0.0000:then returns and again seeks the favor of the damseh Ought she to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_20:0.0000:pardon him or be pitiless ? To the same arbiter the following dilemma
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_21:0.0000:in the Livre du Dit de Poissy 8 is submitted : Which is the more worthy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_22:0.0000:of pity a lady grieving for a lover taken prisoner in battle, or a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_23:0.0250:squire who cannot forget nor cease to love a lady who only despises
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0252_26:0.0000:house of Louis, Duke of Orleans, between a knight embittered by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_4:0.0250:The well-known Arrets d' Amours of Martial d'Auvergne, 1 with the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_5:0.0000:commentaries by Benoit de Court, which have played so important
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_6:0.0000:a part in discussions on the alleged institution of the Court of Love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_7:0.0000:are really only a variety of the debates of which we are giving instances,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_8:0.0000:though they are worked up with a greater parade of legal machinery
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_9:0.0000:and in a more conscious spirit of humorous burlesque. It is strange
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_10:0.0000:that in the face of the fanciful Court of Love setting already quoted, 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_11:0.0000:any one should have seriously supposed that this book contained evi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_12:0.0000:dence for taking the Court of Love as an established institution. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_13:0.0000:Arrets themselves, indeed, are usually trivial enough to make it clear
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_14:0.0000:to any one that they are merely jeux d* esprit. The commentary by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_15:0.0000:Benoit de Court is interesting on account of the mock seriousness
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_16:0.0000:with which he keeps the form of legal discussion and the number
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_17:0.0250:of classical parallels he quotes.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_18:0.0500:The influence of Martial d'Auvergne in giving a more strictly legal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_19:0.0000:turn to the debates is seen in Guillaume Coquillart's(A.D. 1421?-! 491?)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_20:0.0000:Playdoyer d'entre la Simple et la Rusee? Two beauties dispute the heart
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_21:0.0000:of a young gallant. " La Simple " claims to have been his first love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_22:0.0000:and charges " la Ruse'e " with fraudulent interference. But " la Ruse'e "
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_23:0.0000:has him and means to keep him ; so the cause is tried before a tribunal,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_24:0.0000:lawyers arguing on either side. The evidence as to facts is contra-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_25:0.0000:dictory ; an inquest is ordered and the Enqueste d'entre la Simple et la
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_26:0.0000:Rusee, continuing the same plot as a framework, becomes a vehicle for
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_27:0.0000:satire on contemporary life. The Jugement Definitif sur un Plaidoyer
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_28:0.0000:d' 'Amour* is of a similar kind, the plaintiff being a lover who charges
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0253_29:0.0000:an unrelenting mistress with cruelty and gets a verdict in his favor.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_1:0.0500:"la Tannde " and " la Noyre," the question being which is the more
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_2:0.0000:miserable. The first loves a knight whose whereabouts is unknown
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_3:0.0000:to her ; the second is so closely watched by her husband that she
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_4:0.0000:gets no opportunity to show favor to her lover. They finally agree
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_5:0.0000:to refer their case, under false names, to two renowned princesses,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_6:0.0250:the Duchess of Orleans and the Countess of Angouleme. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_8:0.0250:Debat de la Demoiselle et de la Bourgoise? settled in favor of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_11:0.0250:In the debates of which typical specimens have just been cited,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_12:0.0000:the whole piece was in each case the work of one author, the form
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_13:0.0000:being dramatic rather than purely argumentative. But there arose,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_14:0.0000:also very early in the Middle Ages, another kind of poetical debate,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_15:0.0000:one in which there was a real contest between different poets, each
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_16:0.0000:of whom supported only one side. The earliest form of this is the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_17:0.0000:Provencal tensos in its double form of the simple tensos (in which one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_18:0.0000:poet produced a stanza and was answered by another poet using the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_19:0.0000:same verse-form) and the jocx partitz (in which the first poet pro-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_20:0.0000:pounded a question, undertaking to defend the side which the other
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_21:0.0000:did not choose). More than two poets might take part, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_22:0.0000:tensos ended with an appeal to ladies. 4 The very earliest troubadours
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0254_23:0.0000:seem to have used this form, for Diez quotes from William IX.,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_1:0.0250:After the genuine troubadour period was over, when an attempt
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_2:0.0000:was being made in Provence to revive its former poetic glori<
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_3:0.0000:1323 seven citizens of Toulouse formed themselves into
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_4:0.0250:Companhia dels .vii. Trobadors deTholoza," and invited all Provencal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_5:0.0000:poets to assemble at that city on May i, to compete for a golden
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_6:0.0000:violet which was to be given as a prize for the best poem presented.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_7:0.0000:This association or Academy became firmly established, granted
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_8:0.0250:degrees, and drew up an ars poetica the well-known Las Flors del
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_9:0.0250:Gay Saber or Las Leys d' Amors} In the reign of Louis XIV., in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_10:0.0000:1694, new rules were drawn up and a fresh start was made. Royal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_11:0.0500:interest was again shown in 1725 by Louis XV., who increased the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_14:0.0000:the Emperor Conrad I. Speaking of the time of Frederick Barbarossa
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_15:0.0000:he quotes Melchior Goldast 3 thus : " Viri Principes et Equestres
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_16:0.0000:nonnunquam etiam Imperatores, Reges, certamina instituere poetica ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_17:0.0000:in quibus nobili familia Virgines offerebant victoriam cantus," and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_18:0.0000:there is mention of crowns of victory. If, however, Germany got its
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_19:0.0000:example in Provence it must have been from the society of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_20:0.0000:troubadours themselves rather than from this later revival. The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_21:0.0000:Wartburg song-contest, 4 added by Wagner to the Tannhauser story,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_22:0.0500:goes back to a thirteenth-century poem, and so quite antedates the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_23:0.0250:" Jeux Floraux."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0255_24:0.0500:The Provencal jocx partitz appears in Northern France as the jeu

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_1:0.0500:the trouveres in the assemblies known as " Puys d'amour." * These
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_2:0.0250:meetings took their name from a village in Velai, Pui Notre Dame,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_3:0.0000:where there was an annual festival in honor of the Virgin ; but " des
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_4:0.0000:Porigine," says Passy, " 1'esprit litteraire dispute a 1'esprit religieux
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_5:0.0000:la direction des Puys ; souvent meme avec succes." After mass and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_6:0.0000:the singing of sacred music, the crowd entered a hall. On an eleva-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_7:0.0000:tion sat the president, the judges, and other important persons.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_8:0.0000:Hymns to the Virgin, love songs, and finally jeux partis were pre-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_9:0.0000:sented to the audience ; the subjects of these last being the passion
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_10:0.0000:of love and the duties of marriage. One poet gave the challenge,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_11:0.0000:another took it up, and sometimes three, rarely four, engaged in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_12:0.0000:contest, the challenger naming a judge. Sometimes each side named
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_13:0.0000:a judge, and rarely there were three. These gave the decisions, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_14:0.0000:crowd merely looking on ; and crowns of flowers or of silver were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_15:0.0000:awarded to the winners, who gained thus the privileges of (i) being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_16:0.0500:called " Sire " ; (2) wearing the crown at these sessions ; (3) being
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_17:0.0250:a judge in future though this last point is doubtful.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_18:0.0500:The fondness for discussion on the subtler questions of love which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_19:0.0250:is implied in the forms of poetry and social amusement just described,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_20:0.0000:manifested itself in Italy, perhaps less formally but no less frequently. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_21:0.0000:Here for, three centuries the proposing of dubbii, questioni, or giochi,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_22:0.0000:formed one of the chief amusements of courtly society. A picture of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_23:0.0250:the way in which such discussions took place occurs in the Filocolo*
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_24:0.0000:of Boccaccio.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_25:0.0250:Filocolo, driven by stress of tempest into Naples, finds in a garden
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_26:0.0000:a courtly company bent on amusement, with Fiammetta at their head.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_27:0.0250:It is proposed that love-questions be discussed ; Fiammetta is chosen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0256_28:0.0000:queen and arbitress, and crowned with a garland ; the company take

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_3:0.0500:of Boccaccio and from Dante, by Jacomo di Giovanni di Ser Mii
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_5:0.0000:Another instance is found in Castiglione's // Cortegiano? Here
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_6:0.0000:the gentlemen of the ducal court of Urbino propose, on the occasion
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_7:0.0000:of festivities in honor of Pope Julius II., a series of giochi, the ques-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_8:0.0000:tions suggested being such as these : Which virtue would a man
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_9:0.0000:prefer his lady to have ? If she must have some spot, which vice
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_10:0.0000:would he prefer ? Why do women hate rats and love serpents ? The
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_11:0.0000:subject ultimately chosen, the discussion of which forms the sub-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_12:0.0000:stance of the book, is the character and conduct of the ideal gentle-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_13:0.0250:man. Thus // Cortegiano, in spite of its seriousness and extent, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_14:0.0250:yet only an elaborate dubbio discussion.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_15:0.0000:Gli Asolani oi Cardinal Bembo (b. 1470) 8 contains an account of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_16:0.0000:a discussion between three young men and several ladies in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_17:0.0000:garden of the Castello del Trivigiano. The subject is love. Perottino
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_18:0.0000:brings many reasons to prove it a bad thing; Gismondo dwells on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_19:0.0250:the sweetness of its fruits, and declares it is always good ; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_20:0.0500:Lavinello takes up a middle position.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_21:0.0500:In the Quattro Libri di Dubbii of Ortensio Lando 4 (1552) we have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_22:0.0250:a large collection of instances. The four books are : (i) Amorous,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_23:0.0000:(2) Natural, (3) Moral, (4) Religious ; and the questions raised and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_24:0.0000:solved in the first are such as these : Can there be love without
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_25:0.0000:jealousy ? Are men or women more constant in love ? Which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_26:0.0500:deserves love the more, the simple beauty or the clever woman who
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0257_27:0.0250:is plain ?

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_7:0.0250:The foregoing instances sufficiently indicate the different types of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_8:0.0000:love debates prevalent in mediaeval literature and mediaeval society.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_9:0.0000:Taken thus together they seem clearly enough to be the expressions
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_10:0.0000:(various yet constantly running into one another when we attempt to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_11:0.0000:draw lines of division) of the prevalent tendency to take delight in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_12:0.0000:subtle discussions on the subject of love. On such grounds, how-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_13:0.0000:ever, as these instances afford, the belief has been built that there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_14:0.0000:existed in the Middle Ages an institution called the Court of Love, in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_15:0.0000:which actual cases of disagreement between lovers were submitted to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_16:0.0000:formal tribunals, tried by formal laws, and settled by decisions which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_17:0.0000:derived their force from the sanction of public opinion. Besides the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_18:0.0000:material already given in this chapter, three other documents have
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_19:0.0000:been adduced in support of this belief : fat Lives of the Provencal Poets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_20:0.0000:by Johannes Nostradamus, the book of Andreas Capellanus, and a frag-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_21:0.0000:mentary record of a " Cour Amoureuse," held about 1400. Seventy
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_22:0.0000:years ago Diez 2 showed that the evidence of Nostradamus was worth-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_23:0.0000:less ; first, because that writer's idea of the Courts of Love was formed
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_24:0.0000:upon a misunderstanding of passages in the writings of the trouba-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_25:0.0000:dours which referred to the poetical amusements we have described;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_26:0.0000:and, secondly, because his supposed historical examples proved on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_27:0.0000:examination to be inconsistent with the known dates of the alleged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0258_28:0.0000:participants.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_1:0.0250:fourteenth century. Since it has been established that this work is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_2:0.0250:certainly not later than the early years of the thirteenth, its contents
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_3:0.0000:have become the main ground on which the supporters of the older
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_4:0.0000:theory of the Courts of Love have founded their case. It is not part
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_5:0.0000:of the present undertaking to examine in detail the often-repeated
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_6:0.0000:and often- answered arguments on this question. Trojel and Rajna
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_7:0.0000:still find in Andreas certain decisions, stated by him to have been
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_8:0.0000:made by the Countess of Champagne, which they think point to the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_9:0.0000:existence of a serious institution. Gaston Paris, however, continues
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_10:0.0000:to meet them with the objection which has been urged over and over
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_11:0.0000:again but never satisfactorily met, that the conception is inconsistent
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_12:0.0000:with the very conditions in which it is presented. The one essential
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_13:0.0000:requirement in the conduct of all affairs of chivalrous love in the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_14:0.0000:Middle Ages was, as has appeared from our statutes, the necessity
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_15:0.0000:for secrecy. On the other hand, the only means for the enforcing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_16:0.0000:of the decisions of the supposed tribunals that has been suggested by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_17:0.0000:the upholders of the belief in the institution is public opinion. Now
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_18:0.0000:the method of bringing public opinion to bear upon a person whose
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_19:0.0000:very name is unknown to that public has not yet been evolved.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_20:0.0250:Until it has been, it is unnecessary to seek further reasons for scepti-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_21:0.0000:cism with regard to the institution. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_22:0.0250:If then, we reject this belief in a serious tribunal, what have we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_23:0.0000:left? First, we may feel sure that then, as now and always, lovers'
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_24:0.0000:quarrels were sometimes settled by the intervention of a third person ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_25:0.0000:and, doubtless this situation occasionally found its way into litera-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_26:0.0000:ture. 2 But this is no evidence of a formal institution. Second, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_27:0.0000:much more important for our present purpose, there existed, as a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_28:0.0000:very widespread fashionable amusement, the custom of disputing on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_29:0.0000:subtle points of love. This might be in connection with poetical
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_30:0.0000:contests, or might be merely conversation ; there might be formal

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_32:0.0500:designate the winners at all. But there is no proof that the name
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_34:0.0500:2 For example, in Raoul de Houdan's Meraugis de Portlesguez (ed. H. Miche-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0259_35:0.0250:lant, Paris, 1869, pp. 33, 37), in which the queen arbitrates between two rival
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_1:0.0500:" Court of Love " was used of this amusement in the time of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_2:0.0500:troubadours. The phrase belongs originally to the type of allegory
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_5:0.0000:I do not mean to say, however, that these love discussions, -
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_6:0.0000:whether conducted in tenses by troubadours, in jeux partis by trou-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_7:0.0000:veres, as dubbii, questioni, or giochi by Italian courtiers, or as mock-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_8:0.0000:pleadings in the courts of those ladies of whose decisions Andreas
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_9:0.0000:has handed down so misleading a tradition, were without their
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_10:0.0000:influence upon the conduct and ideals of courtly life in the Middle
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_11:0.0000:Ages. As must already have appeared, the question of the existence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_12:0.0000:of Courts of Love comes down to a question of jest or earnest, and the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_13:0.0000:line between these is no easy one to draw. In our modern life we
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_14:0.0000:see men take to sport with all the seriousness of which they are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_15:0.0000:capable, while others, quite literally, " play the game " of politics.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_16:0.0000:An international yacht race moves men as deeply as a national elec-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_17:0.0000:tion, and affects as permanently ideals of conduct and the sense of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_18:0.0000:honor. There is no reason to believe that business and play were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_19:0.0000:any more clearly divided in the Middle Ages * ; and we may grant the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_20:0.0000:love discussions of Eleanor of Aquitaine and her daughter an immense
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_21:0.0000:influence upon knightly conduct without in any way invalidating the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_22:0.0500:contention that these ladies and their courtiers were only playing a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_23:0.0000:game.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_24:0.0250:It was stated above that there were three documents used to sup-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_25:0.0000:port the idea of a serious Court of Love, in addition to the evidence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_26:0.0000:drawn from the debates. The third of these affords an excellent
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_27:0.0000:example of the way in which this phenomenon of the serious influence
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_28:0.0000:of a pastime did occur, in connection, too, with the cultivation of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_29:0.0500:both love and poetry.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_31:0.0250:1 Professor Josiah Royce has drawn my attention to an interesting extension
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_32:0.0000:of the field over which these observations apply, in the phenomena of the play
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_33:0.0000:of birds and other animals, which at certain times (other than mating seasons)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_34:0.0000:meet to perform dances and the like, with all the regularity and apparent serious-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0260_35:0.0000:ness which they exhibit in such necessary activities as getting food. See The

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_2:0.0250:Charles VI. of France. 1 But the manuscript from which this was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_3:0.0000:taken was incomplete, and the earlier pages with the statement of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_4:0.0000:nature of the Court and its most important officers were lacking.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_5:0.0250:Recently, however, M. A. Piaget 2 has found in a collection of armo-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_6:0.0000:rial bearings in a manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale a com-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_7:0.0250:plete list ; and has besides drawn attention to the description of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_8:0.0000:Charter of this Court, published in E. -J. de Turck's Inventaire des
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_9:0.0500:Archives de V Ordre de la Toison d'Or in 1760.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_10:0.0250:From these authorities it appears that the Cour Amoureuse was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_11:0.0000:founded in 1400 " sur 1'humilite et la fidelite ou probitd, et instituee
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_12:0.0000:a 1'honneur des dames." It consisted of (i) Le Prince de la Cour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_13:0.0000:d'amour; (2) three "grands conservateurs " (these were, at the time
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_14:0.0000:of its first organization, Charles VI., Philip, Duke of Burgundy, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_15:0.0000:Louis, Duke of Bourbon); (3) several other "conservateurs"; (4)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_16:0.0250:twenty-four " chevaliers, ecuiers et autres, possedant la rhetorique et
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_17:0.0000:la poesie, appelles ministres de la Cour, lesquels avoient la principale

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_23:0.0000:gives the names of over 600 members, including many of the most
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_24:0.0000:notable people in France. From the statement of the duties of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_25:0.0000:" ministres " it appears that the Cour Amoureuse was meant not only
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_26:0.0000:to glorify and defend ladies, but also to cultivate poetry; for, as
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0261_27:0.0250:M. Piaget says, "en 1400, c'etait tout un."

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_4:0.0000:plaint against Malebouche, after reading which the poet tries to console
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_5:0.0000:her by recalling the calumnies endured by the chaste Susanna and by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_6:0.0000:Our Lord, and advises her to ignore the slanderers, promising that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_7:0.0000:if she does so they will die of chagrin. The lady takes comfort and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_8:0.0250:requests the poet to send to Pierre de Hauteville, prince d' Amour, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_9:0.0000:letter asking him to expose the case to all the members of the Cour
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_10:0.0250:Amoureuse. The epistle follows, and is a formal statement of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_11:0.0500:lady's grievance, with a request to the Court,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_15:0.0500:More than twenty members of the Court are mentioned by name in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_16:0.0000:the epistle, so that we can be sure that the same institution is meant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_17:0.0000:as that described in the charter of the Cour Amoureuse, since all but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_18:0.0000:two of the names occur there also. Malingre was himself a member
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_19:0.0000:of the Court; and it seems fair to suppose that we have here an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_20:0.0000:example of the kind of poem presented at its meetings. The influ-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_21:0.0000:ence of the allegorical Courts of Love upon Malingre's poem is clear ;
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_22:0.0000:and on the' other hand we have the show of an appeal to a tribunal
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_23:0.0000:for the redress of a grievance. Yet there is a significant vagueness
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_24:0.0000:about the redress asked for ; and no one can suppose that anything
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_25:0.0000:was done with reference to actual slanders or similar crimes, though
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_26:0.0250:doubtless the institution made for the preservation of certain chival-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_27:0.0250:rous ideals.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0262_31:0.0500:Item le Prince d'Amours, qui tenoit avec lui musiciens et galans, qui
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_1:0.0000:If this Cour Amoureuse shows us how close the institution of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_2:0.0000:Court of Love could come to some forms of the allegory, it suggests
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_3:0.0000:also how easily it becomes mere pageantry. Even the allegories are
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_4:0.0000:often constructed and described in such a way as to be easily enough
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_5:0.0000:transformed into spectacles ; and in an age that delighted in that
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_6:0.0500:kind of exhibition it was unlikely that the opportunity would be
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_7:0.0000:missed.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_8:0.0250:Thus the names, at least, of personages from .the Court of Love
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_9:0.0000:appear in the municipal celebrations which occurred on Mardi Gras
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_10:0.0250:and other festivals in the great industrial towns in the north of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_11:0.0000:France. At Valenciennes there was a " Feste du Prince de Plai-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_12:0.0000:sance," and we have a record of the attendance at this festival on
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_13:0.0250:May 13, 1348, of two Princes d' Amour, one from Tournay and one
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_14:0.0250:from Lille. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_16:0.0500:de la Fete-Dieu, instituted at Aix in Provence in 1474 by King Rene
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_17:0.0500:of Anjou, to replace certain licentious celebrations which he had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_19:0.0250:On the Monday of the feast of Pentecost the people met after
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_20:0.0000:mass to elect a Prince d' Amour, an Abbe de la Jeunesse, and a Roi
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_21:0.0000:de la Bazoche. The prince who led the fetes chose a court, and a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_22:0.0000:special vote of money was made for their uniforms and other expenses.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_23:0.0000:The games themselves were more or less farcical representations of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_24:0.0000:scriptural incidents, e.g., Le grand Jeu des Diables, in which black and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_25:0.0000:red devils baited Herod, the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_26:0.0000:and so on, much after the fashion of the early religious drama, but
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_27:0.0000:without dialogue and with more pantomime. On the third day there
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_28:0.0000:was a great procession, led by La Renomme'e on horseback, blowing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_29:0.0000:a trumpet. She was followed by burlesque effigies of the Duke and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0263_30:0.0250:Duchess of Urbino, Momus, Mercury, and other mythological char-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_1:0.0250:" dame Ve'nus avec un gros bouquet, et son fils Cupidon, decochant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_2:0.0000:ses sagettes aux jeunes beautes qu'il apergoit ; les ris, les jeux, et les
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_3:0.0000:plaisirs." The music for the games was written by Ren^ himself.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_4:0.0000:Quatrebarbes mentions similar celebrations a* the Jeux de la Ta-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_5:0.0000:rasque, where also the knights elected an Abbe de la Jeunesse.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_6:0.0000:Earlier discussions on the institution of the Court of Love make
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_7:0.0000:much of certain triumphal arches erected at Aix in the end of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_8:0.0250:seventeenth century, one of which represented a Court of Love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_9:0.0250:" Monsieur le Comte vostre pere," says Pierre de Chasteuil-Gallaup,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_10:0.0000:the ingenious antiquary who contrived the decorations, "m'ayant
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_11:0.0000:engage de faire quelques desseins d'arcs de triomphe, pour la

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_17:0.0000:The " explication " here referred to is contained in a Discours sur

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_21:0.0000:me, but from two letters of the author's, published in the Revue des
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_22:0.0000:Langue Romanes, and from the criticisms of the Abbe de Sade, 2 it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_23:0.0000:appears that Chasteuil-Gallaup's ideas about Courts of Love were
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_24:0.0000:gathered from the writings of Caesar and Johannes Nostradamus, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_25:0.0000:sources equally worthless for our purpose. We may, therefore, set
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_26:0.0000:aside the claims made for "les arcs triomphaux dresses en la ville
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_27:0.0250:d'Aix," as being without significance in the present discussion, except
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0264_28:0.0500:as an episode in the history of an exploded theory.

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_12:0.0000:given of some village games in Switzerland that seem to point defi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_13:0.0000:nitely enough to an original connection with the Court of Love. A
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_14:0.0000:wooden Chateau d'Amour was built on the first Sunday of May, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_15:0.0000:the young people of the village divided themselves into two bands,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_16:0.0000:one of which defended, while the other assaulted, the Chateau by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_17:0.0000:means imitated from actual warfare. After it was taken, the day was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_18:0.0000:finished with dancing and carousing. On account of accidents, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_19:0.0000:government of Berne in 1543 passed an edict forbidding the con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_20:0.0000:tinuance of the custom ; but in spite of this, says the anonymous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_21:0.0000:historian, writing in the second decade of the present century, it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_22:0.0250:continued in the environs of Echallens "tout re'cemment."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_23:0.0000:Very similar is the account by the same author of le siege du
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_24:0.0000:Chateau d" 1 Amour in the town of Fribourg. 3 Here the defendants
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_25:0.0000:of the castle were pretty girls, and the attacking party young men.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_26:0.0000:The assault was made to music, and the only weapons were bouquets
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_27:0.0000:and festoons of roses. After the surrender, each member of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_28:0.0000:captured garrison chose one of the conquerors, and ransomed herself
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_29:0.0000:with a kiss and a rose. Then all rode in procession through the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_30:0.0000:streets, and the day ended in illuminations and festivities, in which,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_31:0.0000:however, the attentive fathers and mothers were present, "a maintenir
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0265_32:0.0500:la decence au milieu du bruit, et la courtoisie au milieu de la joie."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0266_3:0.0500:by ladies, and the account of the decorations suggests the gor-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0266_4:0.0500:geousness of the allegories. Fruits, flowers, and perfumes were the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0266_7:0.0500:from the description given by Meyrick to conform quite closely in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0266_8:0.0250:its design to this sort of festival. Pictures of similar carvings may be

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_21:0.0000:which the influence of Martial d'Auvergne is evident. The Parlia-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_22:0.0000:ment is held for the reform of abuses in the " Isle de Cythere " ; and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_23:0.0000:there comes before it a lover complaining of the ingratitude of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_24:0.0000:lady. The defence is that the lady cannot love in return without
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_25:0.0000:losing some of her fresh beauty, and so lessening her power of produ-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_26:0.0250:cing sighs and tears, which are " les tributs de 1'empire amoureux."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_27:0.0000:Verdict is given for the defendant in the interest of the treasury.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_28:0.0000:Le Differend de Beaux Yeux et de Belle Bouche* is a similar dispute,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0267_29:0.0250:the point being as to which is of the greater value in the service of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_2:0.0250:Court of Love motives on the stage. In a piece by Voltaire, 2 Ce qui
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_3:0.0250:plait aux Dames, the point of the old story of the Wyj 'of Bath's Talc
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_4:0.0250:appears. A council discuss the question, a queen presiding, and, of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_5:0.0250:course, conclude " II faut toujours que la femme commande."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_6:0.0000:In the Union de V Amour et des Arts 8 by Le Monnier, Aglae*, Presi-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_7:0.0250:dent of the Court of Love, has not acknowledged her love for Floridan,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_8:0.0000:who, disguised as a shepherd, comes before her to complain of his
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_9:0.0250:mistress's want of responsiveness. He gets a verdict in his favor,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_10:0.0000:discloses his identity, and claims her love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_13:0.0000:At the end of the Veuve a la Mode 6 by de Sainte-Foix, a vaudeville
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_14:0.0500:was presented by G. Panard at the Comedie Italienne in 1726 in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_23:0.0000:broken tryst, a woman of whom her husband is tired, an actress
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_24:0.0250:in the Opera, a " petit-maitre," an old man who wants to marry, a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0268_25:0.0250:coquette, and others, present appropriate petitions and have them
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_1:0.0000:societies founded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_2:0.0000:of which bear traces of Court of Love influence in the nomenclature
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_3:0.0250:adopted. Thus the " Ordre des Chevaliers de la Joye," founded
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_4:0.0250:under the protection of Bacchus and Cupid at Me'zieres in 1696, had
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_5:0.0000:as secretary the Chevalier de Belle-Humeur, and as members the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_6:0.0250:Chevaliers du Printemps, Fidele, Sans-Soucy, de 1'Esperance, Con-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_7:0.0500:stant, Complaisant, and others. 1
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_13:0.0000:borrowed from several different types of Court of Love poems. Les
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_14:0.0000:Decisions de Cy there, or Le Code de V Amour, * 1776, was written by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_15:0.0000:" une femme de Belles Lettres." It begins with an " Edit d'Establis-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_16:0.0000:sement de la Chambre de Justice d'Amour," which tells how Amour,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_17:0.0000:noticing certain abuses growing up in his empire such as mer-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_18:0.0000:cenariness and inconstancy takes counsel with his good mother
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_19:0.0000:Venus, his dear brothers the little Loves, his dear sisters the Graces,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_20:0.0000:and his cousins " les Ris et les Jeux," and on their advice establishes
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_21:0.0000:a court to regulate gallantry. Next come several cases submitted to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_22:0.0000:this court, such as a dispute among a Blonde, a Brunette, and a Spiri-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_23:0.0250:tuelle in a matter of precedence. Then a group of Jurisconsults of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0269_24:0.0000:both sexes discuss a number of questions, e.g. :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_9:0.0500:The god also issues certain laws to be observed in his empire, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_10:0.0250:these are the same as those versified by the Abbe Regnier-Desmarais
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_11:0.0250:in his Edit de V Amour * about a century earlier. There are eighteen
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_12:0.0000:of these, and they are chiefly pieces of advice about winning and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_13:0.0000:retaining a lady's affections, commands against languor, timidity, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_14:0.0000:jealousy, and hints about interpreting signs. Thus the seventh is :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_15:0.0000:If a lover wishes to make a complete conquest and guard against
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_16:0.0000:coldness, he ought to have a plan in his head as well as a passion in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_17:0.0000:his heart. The ninth is : For the reasonable time when one may best
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_18:0.0000:take advantage of the favorable mood, watch the lady's eyes.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_19:0.0000:Genius as " archiprestre d'amour, vicaire et lieutenant general
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_20:0.0000:pour sa Majeste," appears again in a piece by Estienne Pasquier,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_21:0.0000:published at Paris in 1618, and described as Ordonnances Generalles
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_22:0.0000:d' Amour, "-envoyees au seigneur baron de Mirlingues, chevalier des
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_23:0.0000:isles Hyeres." 2 There are fifty ordinances of a figurative sort, forming
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_24:0.0000:a kind of amorous jurisprudence rather than a code of instructions
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_25:0.0500:for individuals.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_27:0.0250:that in Italy the Court of Love material developed in much the same
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_28:0.0000:way as in France. Love has shut himself up in the Isle of Cythera
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_29:0.0000:for the purpose of settling the proper way of loving. He takes to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0270_30:0.0500:counsel Hope and Pleasure, and they decide to have representatives

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_1:0.0250:of the chief modes ; so an English, a French, and an Italian lady of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_2:0.0000:fashion are summoned to the Congress. The allegorical framework,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_3:0.0000:most of which is borrowed from the familiar mediaeval tradition, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_4:0.0000:some of which more definitely recalls parts of the Hypnerotomachia, is
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_5:0.0000:thus used as a setting for a discussion of national customs and habits
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_6:0.0000:of mind " la sensibile delicatezza del cuore delle italiane, la non
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_9:0.0000:From Italy, too, is said to have come the first hint for the motive
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_10:0.0000:of a story of Cupid that developed in France, and is found to some
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_11:0.0000:extent in England also. Les trois Contes de Cupido et d'Atropos,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_12:0.0000:found in the work of Jean Lemaire des Beiges, is alleged by Becker
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_13:0.0000:to go back to two sonnets of Serafino Aquilano. 1 Lemaire's first tale 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_14:0.0000:begins with an account of a drinking bout between Love and Death,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_15:0.0000:which results in the two gods getting their shooting gear exchanged.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_16:0.0000:Each begins to shoot, with the disastrous consequences of killing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_17:0.0000:the young men, and inflaming the old with love.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_18:0.0250:The second tale brings Cupid home to his mother's palace, where
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_19:0.0000:she and her nymphs are having a siesta. Many of the mediaeval
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_20:0.0000:features are recognizable in the description of the Castle. 3 Love's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_21:0.0000:daughter Volupte is accidentally pricked by one of the deadly
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_22:0.0000:arrows, great excitement follows the discovery, and finally the bow
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_23:0.0000:and arrows of Death are thrown into the moat and Cupid is put
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_24:0.0000:out of the hall. Death comes up to the gate, driving his crowd of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_25:0.0000:lovesick dotards who drag the dead bodies of Cupid's victims, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_26:0.0000:Venus urges her son, who has now awakened, to get back his bow.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_27:0.0000:Cupid tries in vain to slay Death with his own arrows ; but Death
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_28:0.0000:merely mocks him and says that in future they will take each other's
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_29:0.0000:names as well as weapons. Meanwhile the water in the moat has
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_30:0.0250:been poisoned by Death's arrows, and Venus and her nymphs try to
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0271_31:0.0000:sweeten it with flowers and honey. They make it more attractive
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_1:0.0500:but no less deadly, and all those who drink of the water or eat of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_2:0.0000:what grows on its banks are smitten with a fearful disease. Such
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_3:0.0000:terror does this create that many are driven to virtue by fear.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_9:0.0000:These stories were still further continued in the Triumph* de Dame
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_10:0.0250:Verolle, published at Lyons in 1539. * This is an allegorical proces-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_11:0.0000:sion, of the type already exemplified, 2 in which Dame Verolle, the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_12:0.0250:personification of the disease contracted from the poisoned moat,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_13:0.0500:takes the part of " Royne du Puy d' Amours."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_15:0.0250:weapons of Love and Death is used by Richard Barnfield (1594)
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_16:0.0500:to account for an old man's falling in love with a queen whose young
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_19:0.0000:tion in fashionable society long after the Middle Ages. In England it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_20:0.0000:is reflected, for example, in certain scenes in Shakspere's earlier
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_21:0.0000:comedies. 4 In France we have an historical instance considerably
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_22:0.0000:later. In the Memoires d'Anne de Gonzague? written about 1664,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_23:0.0000:that Princess describes the assemblies at the Hotel de Rambouillet,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_24:0.0000:where even Cardinal Richelieu took part in discussions on love and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_25:0.0250:poetry. One day Mademoiselle de Scudery told of a man who was
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_26:0.0000:in great grief at parting with his mistress, and she said that he spoke
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_27:0.0000:in a ravishing manner of the happiness of being loved. The Due
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0272_28:0.0000:d'Enghien, however, protested that this man did not love "bien
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_0:0.0500:The Origins and Sources of the Court of Love. 263
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_1:0.0000:etre plus occupe de son amour, que des sentimens qu'il inspire." A
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_2:0.0000:dispute followed, and Richelieu, hearing of it, gave a great dinner at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_3:0.0250:Ruel to all those who had taken part. The Princess Palatine's sister
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_4:0.0000:was made president, and the rest took their places with great gravity.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_5:0.0000:The discussion was reopened, the Cardinal collected the votes, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_6:0.0000:the decision was in favor of the opinion of the Due d'Enghien. " Vous
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_7:0.0000:vous etonnerez," concludes the narrator, "peut-etre des formes et de
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_8:0.0500:1'appareil imposant que donnoit le Cardinal a cette assemble ; mais
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_9:0.0250:c'etoit Pesprit du terns, et le sien particulierement en amour."
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_10:0.0500:The work in English which shows the most extensive traces of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_11:0.0000:Court of Love influence after 1520 is the Faerie Queene. It would
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_12:0.0000:require a quite disproportionate amount of space here to show in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_13:0.0000:detail even the more elaborate instances of Spenser's borrowings
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_14:0.0000:from mediaeval love-allegory ; and we shall have to be content with a
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_15:0.0000:single instance of his method of treating the tradition.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0273_16:0.0250:In Canto xi of Book III occurs a description of the altar of Cupid,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0274_29:0.0500:and Garlande of Laurell. See Poetical Works of John Skclton, ed. by Dyce,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0274_30:0.0500:Lond., 1843, I 3 ft- and 3 01 ff.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0275_27:0.0250:personified abstractions appear. The Seate of Worthie Governance
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0275_28:0.0500:is supported by Pure Religion, Love of Subjects, Wisdom, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_2:0.0000:represented as cast out of heaven and receiving ignominious treat-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_3:0.0250:ment from a Philosopher, from Chastity, Modesty, Temperance, and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_4:0.0000:others. 1 Elizabeth's role of the. Virgin Queenjiaturally encouraged
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_5:0.0250:the irreverent treatment of the Love deities, and brought about an
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_6:0.0250:exalting of Diana at the expense of Venus.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_8:0.0500:assault on the Fortress of Perfect Beauty by Virtuous Desire. 2
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_19:0.0250:In the Progresses of James I. of England the same kind of thing
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_20:0.0000:continues with more and more of a tendency towards the definite
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_21:0.0000:masque form. Thus in Ben Jonson's Masque at Lord Hadingtorfs
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_22:0.0000:Marriage 6 (1607-8) Love has the usual accompaniments of roses,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_23:0.0250:transfixed hearts, etc., and Venus is drawn in a chariot by doves and
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_24:0.0250:swans, and attended by Graces.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_26:0.0000:and Antiquity? in which were a Sanctuary of Fame, a Parliament of
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_27:0.0000:Honour, and a triumphant chariot of Love drawn by two "luzerns or
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_28:0.0000:lynxes." Other Triumphs, such as the Triumph of London, of Honour,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0276_29:0.0250:of Peace, and so on, are frequent ; likewise Temples of Honour, Palaces
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_4:0.0250:The denouement of this play is brought about by the disguised
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_5:0.0000:Duke of Ferrara, who as a fawning courtier has got up a court enter-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_6:0.0000:tainment in the form of a Parliament of Love. Cupid is led in by
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_7:0.0000:Drunkenness, Sloth, Pride, and Plenty, and is followed by Folly, War,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_8:0.0250:Beggary, and Laughter. After a health is drunk to Venus, Cupid
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_9:0.0000:says that he means to enforce his old laws, and calls for the reading
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_10:0.0000:of the Statutes. These are constructed with a view to the various
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_11:0.0000:situations in which the dramatis personae have been represented in
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_12:0.0000:the preceding acts ; and after each is read, the particular culprit
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_13:0.0250:aimed at is called forth and has judgment passed on him. The first
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_14:0.0250:begins thus :
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_16:0.0000:potent Don Cupid, emperor of sighs and protestations ... for the main-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0277_17:0.0000:taining and relieving of his old soldiers, maimed or dismembered in love,
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_6:0.0250:A month is allowed in which to arrange matters out of court.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_7:0.0000:The interval is filled in with a plot of a type familiar enough at
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_8:0.0000:that period, and when the Court of Love comes to be held, it
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_9:0.0000:varies little from the usual scene for the administering of poetical
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_10:0.0000:justice, such, e.g., as that in Measure for Measure, except that the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_11:0.0250:speeches on either side are slightly more formal, and a priest with
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_12:0.0500:an image of Cupid is introduced.
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_13:0.0500:D'Avenant's Temple of Love and The Triumphs of the Prince
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_16:0.0250:Systematic search in literature of the modern period would doubt-
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_17:0.0000:less bring to light many more developments and survivals of the
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_18:0.0000:motives which formed such an important element in the books which
harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_19:0.0000:delighted, to an extent that amazes us, our mediaeval ancestors. The

harvardstudiesno06harvuoft_0278_21:0.0000:the influence, down to even comparatively late times, of that tradition

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_2:0.0000:ignorance of antiquity ascribed to Vergil is extant an
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_3:0.0000:elegiac composition of 178 lines which in the one early MS.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_4:0.0250:containing the whole poem, the Bruxellensis of the twelfth
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_5:0.0250:century, is written, without any indication of discontinuity,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_6:0.0000:as a single poem. Joseph Scaliger was the first to show
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_7:0.0000:that in reality a break occurs after 144 N'on umquani
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_8:0.0000:sitiens florida semper eris, and that the verses which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_9:0.0250:follow beginning Sic est Maecenas fato ueniente locutus,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_10:0.0000:form a new elegy, describing Maecenas' dying moments as
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_11:0.0000:1-144 deal with his character as a living man.^ This
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_12:0.0250:view of two distinct elegies has been generally accepted
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_13:0.0000:since ; but there is, perhaps, room for a slightly different
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_14:0.0000:hypothesis; the original poem may have been much longer
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_15:0.0000:than what remains in the Brussels MS. ; it may have
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_16:0.0000:extended to 400 or, like the Consolatio ad Liuiam, to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_17:0.0000:nearly 500 verses. Then the lacuna between 144, 145
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_18:0.0000:might be occupied with the more intimate and private
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_19:0.0000:relations of Maecenas with Augustus (including his loss
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_20:0.0000:of favour) in the later years of both, and this would
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_21:0.0000:naturally introduce the death scene, which begins with 145.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_22:0.0000:In any case there can be as little doubt that Scaliger was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_23:0.0000:right in dissevering the two portions of this Elegia in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_24:0.0000:Ma^enatem, as that Jacobs was right in dissevering the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_25:0.0000:two portions of the pseudo-Vergilian Dirae^ which are
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_26:0.0000:similarly continuous and without break in the MSS., into
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0006_29:0.0250:324928
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_13:0.0000:We should reply unhesitatingly, the youth can be no
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_14:0.0000:other than Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, whose death
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_15:0.0000:preceded Maecenas' death by a year, an agreement with
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_16:0.0250:the words of the poem, as Vahlen has observed, of rather
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_17:0.0000:special exactness (Skutsch ap. Pauly-Wissowa, s.v. Con-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_18:0.0000:solatio), were it not for two objections : (i) that where
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_19:0.0000:Drusus is believed to be actually mentioned in the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_20:0.0500:Maecenas, 147-8,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_23:0.0250:the Bonixdlensis and all the remaining codices known to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_24:0.0000:me (of which I shall speak further on) agree to give Bruti
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_25:0.0000:for Drusi, fidem for diem. As sane a critic as Meibom
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_26:0.0000:retained Bi^ti . . .fidem, explaining the words to mean, 'Is it
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_27:0.0000:possible that I, Maecenas, should die at an age later than
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_28:0.0000:Brutus, whom Julius Caesar brought up as his own son and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_29:0.0000:trained to be loyal to the imperial house ? ', a sense which,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_30:0.0000:however, can scarcely be got into the words, even if with
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0007_31:0.0000:Meibom we read augudam. (2) the second objection to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_0:0.0000:identifying the iuuenis, whose death the poet had before
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_1:0.0000:deplored, with Drusus the son of Liuia, is the almost in-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_2:0.0000:evitable conclusion that the author of Maecenas was the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_3:0.0000:author of the Conaolatio. As Schanz has observed, it is not
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_4:0.0000:necessary to read more than a very slight portion of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_5:0.0000:two poems to repudiate such a conclusion. The style of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_6:0.0000:one is wholly and essentially diflFerent from the style of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_7:0.0000:other. The Conaolatio is greatly influenced by Ovid, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_8:0.0000:is throughout written in what may be called the classical
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_9:0.0000:form of elegy at the time. The Maecenas is compara-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_10:0.0000:tively nondescript in form : far removed from the manner-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_11:0.0000:isms and artifices of the Ovidian school, it maintains a
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_12:0.0000:level plainness of style and diction which Meibom has not
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_13:0.0000:inaptly characterized as huviilis (low or without elevation).
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_14:0.0250:The Consolatio is an artificial work^ with little of nature :
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_15:0.0000:the Maecenas does not aspire to be anything great, but yet
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_16:0.0000:is pleasing from its mere simplicity. It has far more of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_17:0.0500:natural feeling, far less of what is technical or rhetorical.*
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_18:0.0250:I do not agree on this point with Schanz, who pronounces
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_19:0.0500:the Consolatio to be the work of a tolerable poet, the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_20:0.0500:Maecenas of a bungler.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_21:0.0000:The two above-mentioned objections to believing Drusus
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_22:0.0250:to be the iuuenis of u. i have their weight, but are not con-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_23:0.0000:clusive. The two parts into which the Maecenas falls have
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_24:0.0000:an intimate coiTespondence, not only in language and metre,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_25:0.0000:but reference. Hence, if in the first of these we are told at
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_26:0.0000:the outset by the poet that he had not long before written
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_27:0.0000:an epicedium on the premature death of a young man,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_28:0.0000:when the second part similarly begins with a passionate
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_29:0.0000:compl€kint against the cruelty of the gods which had cut off
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_30:0.0000:a young man in his prime, it is a natural, though not
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_31:0.0000:^ There are points in which ifc approaches the style of the Elegy ad
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_32:0.0500:Mes$cUlam included in the Caialepia ; but metrical considerations, especially
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0008_33:0.0000:the uniform adoption of a disyllabic ending to the pentameter as opposed
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_0:0.0250:6
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_1:0.0500:necessary, inference that the youth thus early extinguished
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_2:0.0000:should be in both parts of the poem the same. And this
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_3:0.0000:identification would be supported by the coincidence of rela-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_4:0.0000:tion in either section of the poem to Maecenas and the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_5:0.0000:imperial house of the Caesars. Any allusion to a man who,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_6:0.0250:like Brutus, had taken part in the murder of Julius Caesar,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_7:0.0000:would be out of place, and wholly alien to the feeling which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_8:0.0000:the poet uniformly conveys. And if the iuuenis is not, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_9:0.0000:hardly can be, Brutus, so far as I can see, Drusus and Drusus
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_10:0.0000:alone ^ suits the palaeographical requirements of 148. Ex-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_11:0.0000:perts will support me in stating that the interchange of d
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_12:0.0000:and b in MSS. is familiar and acknowledged ; fidem might be
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_13:0.0000:retained, and (reading augudam with MS. Arundel 133
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_14:0.0000:and the codex once in possession of Petrus Servius, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_15:0.0000:now in the Bodleian) be explained of the princely loyalty of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_16:0.0250:Drusus to the house of the Caesars : yet, as the Bt^xellensis,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_17:0.0000:our oldest voucher, gives anguduin . . ,Jidem, not angustam,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_18:0.0000:it is more than possible that fidem is a corruption of die?n,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_19:0.0250:an error of transcription too eiisily defensible by numerous
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_21:0.0500:As to the other objection — the dissimilarity of style in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_22:0.0250:the Consolatio and the Maecenas — we cannot feel sure
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_23:0.0000:that our surviving Conaolatio ad Liuiam de morte Drusl
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_24:0.0000:is the only poem that commemorated the death of Drusus :
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_25:0.0000:there may well have been other Epicedia by less ambitious
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_26:0.0000:versifiers ; amongst them by the author of Maecenas, who
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_27:0.0000:perhaps tried then his limited powers for the first time
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_28:0.0000:on a subject of national and world-wide interest. That his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_29:0.0000:epicedion on Drusus should have perished, whilst his elegy
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_30:0.0000:on Maecenas has survived, would be one of those freaks of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_31:0.0000:* Marcellus is out of the question, as ho died in 23 b. c, which does not
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_32:0.0500:agree with Lefltram iuuinis tristi modo carmine fata ; and the view mentioned
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_33:0.0000:by Meibom, p. 171, that a son of Maecenas, who died in early youth, is
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0009_34:0.0000:alluded to, seems to have as little solid foundation as the gloss in the MS.

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_0:0.0000:chance or accidents of literature which can surprise no one.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_1:0.0000:'But/ it will be said, 'the Maecenas is unworthy of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_2:0.0000:Augustan age and cannot have been written in it ' : to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_3:0.0000:which we may answer, with Meibom, that the humbleness
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_4:0.0000:of the verses does not prove anything as to the time when
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_5:0.0000:they were written. The Augustan era had its great stars
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_6:0.0000:and its smaller lights. Of the long list of versifiers men-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_7:0.0000:tioned by Ovid m the last of his elegies from Pontus how
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_8:0.0000:very few have survived ! Not that I would defend the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_9:0.0000:Augustaneity of our poem from its ascription to Vergil ;
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_10:0.0000:compositions as palpably non-Augustan as Itosae, Est et
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_11:0.0250:Non, Vir Bonus have been admitted to the same privilege,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_13:0.0000:Joseph Scaliger thought the Maecenas was written by
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_14:0.0000:Albinovanus ^ Pedo^ and the weight of his authority has
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_15:0.0000:given credibility to this view till comparatively recent times.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_16:0.0000:But the highly-coloured passage quoted by the elder
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_17:0.0250:Seneca from Pedo's poem on the expedition of Germanicus
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_18:0.0250:(or possibly Drusus) to the German Ocean is inconsistent
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_19:0.0000:with such a view : we have in it a true specimen of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_20:0.0000:later Augustan poetry, such as the writer of Maecenas could
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_21:0.0250:never have aspired to. More modem critics have contented
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_22:0.0000:themselves with attempts to fix the date. Haupt thought he
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_23:0.0500:could trace the chief source of the Maecenas in the younger
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_24:0.0250:Seneca's 1 14th letter, in which the philosopher, prefacing
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_25:0.0000:with the words quoniodo Maecenas uixerit notius est quam
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_26:0.0250:ut narrari nunc debeat, proceeds to a detailed description
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_27:0.0000:of his walk, his effeminacy, his parade of a loose style of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_28:0.0000:dressing and speaking: then quotes, as an illustration
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_29:0.0000:of his outlandish and extravagant dictions, a number of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_30:0.0000:instances, the reading and meaning of which have ever
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0010_31:0.0000:since been the despair of interpreters, as the attempts
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_0:0.0500:8
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_7:0.0000:Much more to the same effect might be found in Seneca's
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_8:0.0500:voluminous philosophical writings. But that the poem was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_9:0.0250:based on Ep. 114, or on Seneca at all, is a rather arbitrary
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_10:0.0000:hypothesis which does not commend itself to a judicial
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_11:0.0000:criticism, and has been rejected by the latest modern
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_12:0.0000:writers as decidedly as Haupt's other view, that the Covr-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_13:0.0250:solatio ad Liuiani was a forgery of the fifteenth century.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_18:0.0000:eoluta est qvxtm ip>8e discindus? or Non atatim, haec
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_19:0.0000:cum legeria, tibi occurret hunc esse qui solutis tunicis
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_20:0.0250:in Vrbe semper incesseHt? merely turns on a point
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_21:0.0000:of dress which, as Skutsch has observed, was the well-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_22:0.0000:known almost proverbial symbol of effeminacy. Long
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_23:0.0000:before his death Maecenas had passed into a type of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_24:0.0000:soft living; it did not require the tirades of a Seneca
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_25:0.0000:to suggest what the poet might have witnessed with his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_26:0.0000:own eyes. At any rate, there seems no valid reason
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_27:0.0000:for thrusting the poem down, as Haupt seems to imply,*
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_28:0.0000:to a late period of the Empire, when such an apology
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_29:0.0000:for softness would fall flat and perhaps hardly be under-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_30:0.0000:stood, and when the history of the man himself, as detailed
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_31:0.0000:in the two Elegies, would be out of place and out of time.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0011_32:0.0000:Far nearer, I believe, to the fact, is the opinion of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_0:0.0500:9
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_4:0.0250:supplied by the name Lollius (u. lo), whom both Hubner^

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_13:0.0500:old and young alike. To this task I am impelled, not by
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_14:0.0250:personal acquaintance with Maecenas, but by the request
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_16:0.0250:(13-20) The stock of Maecenas was Etruscan and regal : he
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_17:0.0000:was the right hand of Caesar (i.e. Augustus) and chief of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_18:0.0000:uigiles of Rome. Tet, though so high in Caesar's favour, he
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_19:0.0000:never abused his power. In him were combined the arts of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_20:0.0000:Minerva and Apollo ; if he showed a preference for things
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_21:0.0000:fine and rare, who is there that does not prefer the rich
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_22:0.0250:gems (? shells) of the Syrian coast to those of commoner
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_23:0.0500:shores 1 *
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_24:0.0500:(21-38) The one fault alleged against Maecenas, his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_26:0.0000:and simplicity. Jealousy must confess that his flowing
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_27:0.0000:tunics did not interfere with his energy in guarding the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_28:0.0000:streets of Rome against bullies and cut-throats. His un«
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_29:0.0500:aspiring nature shrank from the glitter of triumphs, though
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_30:0.0000:in his graap, had he wished them : he preferred to large
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_31:0.0000:estates and splendour the shade of a garden, the fall of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0012_32:0.0000:waters, the songs of birds, the cult of the Muses ; for song
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_0:0.0500:10
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_3:0.0500:(39-92) And what was he to do? He had played his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_4:0.0500:part as a soldier, had fought against Sextus Pompeius in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_5:0.0000:Sicily^ against Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, against
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_6:0.0000:Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. Victory and peace
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_7:0.0000:brought their natural relaxation. Did not Apollo, the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_8:0.0000:same god who, at Actium, prevented the subjection of Rome
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_9:0.0000:to Antony and his Eastern paramour, and pursued with
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_10:0.0000:his arrows the barbaric host to the furthest comer of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_11:0.0000:Orient, drop his bow and strike his lyre, when victory had
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_12:0.0000:set in 1 Thou too, Bacchus, when Rome had conquered
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_13:0.0500:India's coloured populations, didst return to the wine-cup,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_14:0.0000:didst assume a double tunic, each of purple, didst carry
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_15:0.0000:a jewelled thyrsus and, in the jollity of thy heart,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_16:0.0000:address it with words of free-spoken sincerity.^ I recall it
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_17:0.0000:all, even the silvered anklets thou wilt acknowledge to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_18:0.0000:have worn, and the new-fashioned words which suited so
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_19:0.0500:well, young Bacchus, with thy frank and boyish mood.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_20:0.0000:Hercules himself, hero of so many athla, could forget
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_21:0.0000:his conflict with the lion of Nemea, the boar of Eryman-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_22:0.0000:thus, to dally with Lydian Omphale. The lion's skin and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_23:0.0000:knotted club put aside, he submitted to twirl the distaff,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_24:0.0000:bite the uneven surface of the bobbin, be cuffed by Omphale
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_25:0.0000:for working into knots or rudely breaking the thread.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_26:0.0000:And this was he who, as an infant, had stifled the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_27:0.0000:huge serpents, shorn away the Hydra's renascent heads,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_28:0.0000:* quelled the fury of Diomede's horse, slain Geryon with
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_29:0.0500:his three bodies and six hands. Nay, Jupiter himself,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_30:0.0000:^ I agree with Meibom in considering the words Et tibi consuUo u^ba fxurt
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_31:0.0000:noua to be an allusion to the insignifa uerba which characterized the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_32:0.0000:speech of Maecenas and of which some specimens are quoted in Seneca^s
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_33:0.0000:114th letter. Gf. 117 *Haec uerba tam improbe stnicta . . . tarn contra
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_34:0.0000:consuetudinom omnium posita ostendunt mores non minus nouos . .•
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_35:0.0000:fuisse.* To Maecenas was ascribed the suggestion of a new kind of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_36:0.0500:aif^tation in style {noua cacozelia) traceable in the works of Vergil (see
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0013_37:0.0500:Ifeftleship, p. 30 of his Ancient Lives qf Vergil),
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_0:0.0500:11
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_2:0.0500:patching his eagle to look for the Ganymede who should
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_5:0.0250:enjoy and sleep on a bed of roses, for the vanquished to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_6:0.0500:plough, reap, and be the slave of alarms. Seasonable-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_7:0.0000:ness determines everything; the steer ploughs by day,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_8:0.0250:reposes by night ; the swallow hides itself in winter, flits
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_9:0.0000:twittering over the lake in spring. Maecenas' life of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_10:0.0000:indolent seclusion coincided with his friend Caesar's
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_11:0.0000:elevation. Sheltered by the approbation of Augustus,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_14:0.0250:(107-128) Would that he had possessed Medea's drug of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_15:0.0500:rejuvenescence ! Flowers fade and revive ; stags shed their
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_16:0.0000:horns and receive new ones ; crows live and live on year
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_17:0.0000:after year; why is man alone condemned to rapid ex-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_18:0.0000:tinction ? Aurora could make Tithonus immortal ; would
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_19:0.0000:that Maecenas had found a consort as potent as she !
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_20:0.0000:Certainly, like Tithonus, he deserved to harness her steeds
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_21:0.0250:at dawn, place the reins in her hands, stroke their manes
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_23:0.0500:(129-144) For Maecenas was mourned as fondly as
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_24:0.0250:Hesperus, the youth so suddenly extinguished, was mourned
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_25:0.0000:by his sorrowing companions. One admirer brings saffron,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_26:0.0000:another casia, another balsam, to honour his tomb. Nestor,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_27:0.0000:the old man of three generations, could not live long
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_28:0.0000:enough to content his friends : and Metecenas might have
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_29:0.0000:rivalled him had the threads of his destiny been in my (the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_30:0.0000:poet's) disposal. As it is, what remains for me to do?
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_31:0.0000:I can only implore the earth to lie softly upon him and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_32:0.0000:not press him with its full weight. We, for our part, will
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_33:0.0000:bring to thee, O earth, unfailing gifts of flowers and per-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0014_34:0.0500:fumes; drought thou shalt never feel, never be without
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_3:0.0250:* Alas, that I have outlived him who should have survived
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_4:0.0000:me (Drusus). A boy in years, he was a man in ripeness of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_5:0.0250:understanding, a creature worthy of its creator, Caesar.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_6:0.0000:And would that I had died before the breach (with
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_7:0.0000:Augustus) ' — shame prevented his saying more : but it was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_8:0.0000:clear his thoughts were of his wife (Terentia) and that he
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_9:0.0000:missed her touch, voice, kiss, and embrace in his dying
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_11:0.0500:'Yet it may console me to remember that, living and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_12:0.0000:dying, I was the friend of Caesar. Perhaps he will drop
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_13:0.0000:a tear when he is told " Maecenas is no more". One only
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_14:0.0000:boon I ask, to be buried happily : yet I could also hope
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_15:0.0000:that you, Caesar, will still remember, still talk of me. It is
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_16:0.0000:not your custom to forget a friend because he is dead.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_17:0.0000:I, in my turn, shall remember you from the dust of my
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_18:0.0000:grave. It was you that gave me wealth and made
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_19:0.0000:the name of Maecenas unique and memorable. I was the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_20:0.0000:guide of your counsels, your inner and informing spirit.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_21:0.0000:May you live to a prolonged old age, and not pass to the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_22:0.0000:Immortals till late. This is the world's necessity ; it should
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_23:0.0000:be your own wish. May the two young Caesars grow up
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_24:0.0000:to transmit undiminished the glories of their race ; above
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_25:0.0000:all let Livia be the object of your supremest care, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_26:0.0000:Tiberius compensate for him you have lost. But earth
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_27:0.0000:must not retain a god ; scion as thou art of ancestors that
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_28:0.0000:were divine, let Venus herself place thee (Augustus) in the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_29:0.0500:bosom of thy father * (Julius Caesar).
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_30:0.0250:It will be seen from this outline that the subject of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_31:0.0250:poem is what may be called an Apologia pro uita Maecenatia^
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_32:0.0250:a defence of the great minister against the attacks on his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_33:0.0000:life and character. This apology (which we perhaps possess
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_34:0.0250:only in a fragmentary condition) mainly turns upon a single
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0015_35:0.0000:point, Maecenas* undeniable effeminacy of conduct and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_1:0.0500:morals, and his affectations in diction and dress. They
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_2:0.0250:were parts, says the poet, of a frank open character which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_3:0.0000:despised concealment and prided itself on its candour.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_4:0.0000:The very word has almost come to connote the man. The
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_5:0.0000:Elegy itself supplies three examples: 4 caiulidua, 62 can*
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_6:0.0000:didi(yi*a, 135 candoris] and every one will recall Horace's
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_7:0.0000:candide Maecenas. In tiroes of peace Maecenas could show
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_8:0.0000:himself in the streets of Rome in double tunics falling to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_9:0.0000:the feet, and an unedifying looseness of demeanour which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_10:0.0000:ill-suited the praefectus urbi ; but when war came, he could
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_11:0.0000:brace himself to its duties and fight vigorously, as he
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_12:0.0000:proved in the naval campaign against Sextus PompeiuSi
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_13:0.0250:at Philippi and Actium. And no one can say that he was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_14:0.0000:unenergetic in the defence of the city against footpads or
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_15:0.0000:nocturnal assassins: Rome was safe when Augustus was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_16:0.0000:away. And did not Augustus himself overlook or ignore
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_17:0.0000:his minister's failings? He, at least, did not form his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_18:0.0000:judgements inconsiderately. At this point (107 sqq.) the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_19:0.0250:poet turns off very abruptly to a mythological digression,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_20:0.0000:which, beginning with the story of Medea's caldron and the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_21:0.0000:magical renovation of Pelias, goes on to speak, first of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_22:0.0250:Tithonus, whom Aurora preserved unharmed by the old
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_23:0.0000:age which she could not prevent, then of Nestor, the vener-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_24:0.0000:able sage of Pylos, who had seen three generations come
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_25:0.0000:and go ; introducing by the way a remote and very obscure
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_26:0.0000:legend of Hesperus. This somewhat empty display of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_27:0.0250:mythological learning, intended, it would seem, to show off
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_28:0.0000:the poet's acquaintance with the technical and rhetorical
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_29:0.0250:rules on which epicedia and poems of consolation were
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_30:0.0000:framed (Skutsch, Lillge), serves to introduce a wish that
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_31:0.0000:the life of Maecenas might have been artificially prolonged ;
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_32:0.0000:a wish, in lieu of which, as vain, the poet offers a prayer to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_33:0.0250:Earth, to lie less heavily on the beloved shade, and promises
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0016_34:0.0500:an offering, ever to be renewed, of flowers and perfumes,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_1:0.0500:With this (144) the first cleviy, or perhaps the first part of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_5:0.0250:unless we suppose, as its comparative shortness, 34 verses
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_6:0.0000:against 144 of the firat elegy, justifies our supposing that
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_7:0.0250:a considerable number of verses are lost. These would seem
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_8:0.0000:to have preceded 145, since the fragment is otherwise con-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0017_13:0.0000:I shall quote the whole of this section to give an idea of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_0:0.0500:15
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_13:0.0000:his last thoughts, partly of his wife Terentia, partly of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_14:0.0000:Augustus, whose intimacy with Terentia could not but
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_15:0.0250:disturb the last moments of her husband. Yet Maecenas
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_16:0.0000:takes a justifiable pride in the knowledge of being not only
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_17:0.0000:the friend of Caesar, but the guiding spirit of his policy
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_18:0.0000:(26 Pectus eram uei*e pecto)^ ipse tui), expresses his last
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_19:0.0000:good wishes for the continued life of Augustus, and the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_20:0.0000:prosperity of the imperial family : and ends with a parting
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_21:0.0000:prayer that one who was already a god on earth should
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_22:0.0000:attain to more complete consummation of godhead in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_23:0.0500:heaven.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_24:0.0250:It is difficult to believe that a piice justificative of this
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_25:0.0000:kind should be the work of a time far removed from the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_26:0.0250:era of Augustus. Not that such theories are unknown in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_27:0.0250:other and much more conspicuous instances. The Astrono-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_28:0.0000:mical poem which goes under the name of Manilius, a
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_29:0.0000:work of the early part of the first century A. D., was
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_30:0.0000:once believed to date from the age of Theodosius; the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_31:0.0000:Satirae of Petronius Arbiter were thought by Niebuhr to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_32:0.0000:belong to the age of Alexander Severus or Gordian : there
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_33:0.0000:are critics who deny the Ibis, usually included in the list of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_34:0.0000:Ovid's works, to be by him, and pronounce it a forgery,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0018_35:0.0500:perhaps by a Christian and not earlier than the third
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_0:0.0500:16
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_4:0.0000:There are, indeed, not wanting special reasons for such a
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_5:0.0250:view. Meibom, with that enlarged erudition which marks
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_6:0.0250:his monograph, has shown that several extant compositions
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_7:0.0000:purporting to be written by contemporaries of Maecenas,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_8:0.0000:mostly works dedicated to him, are apocryphal. He mentions
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_9:0.0000:the supposed letter addressed to Maecenas by Horace, from
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_10:0.0000:which Suetonius cites a passage in his Life ^ of that poet ;
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_11:0.0000:a Latin translation of a supposed letter by Hippocrates
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_12:0.0250:similarly addressed ad Maecenatem which is found at the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_13:0.0000:beginning of the Laon MS. of Marcellus Empiricus' treatise
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_14:0.0000:de Medicamentis, and seems to be identical with the liieUus
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_15:0.0250:generally known as de tuenda twietudine ad Maecenatem,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_16:0.0000:ascribed to Antonius Musa, the famous physician who cured
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_17:0.0000:Augustus (p. 105 in the edition of Caldani, Bassano, 1800);
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_18:0.0000:and the so-called Isagoge of Soranus of Ephesus, which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_19:0.0000:Meibom believed to belong to the age of Hadrian *• Why
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_20:0.0000:should not our poem be ranked with these and be added
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_21:0.0000:to the list of Maecenatian forgeries? If it was written
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_22:0.0000:long after, this might account for its seldom or never
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_23:0.0000:occurring in the same MSS. with the Consolatio ad Liuiam.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_24:0.0000:It had never been associated with that work, because it
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_25:0.0000:belonged to a perfectly different period of literature; the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_26:0.0000:tradition of dissociation remained as a fact in the few and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_27:0.0000:rare MSS. which preserved it. Its nondescript style
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_28:0.0000:might be thought to point in the same direction. It most
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_29:0.0250:nearly resembles some of the elegiac poems scattered
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0019_30:0.0250:> Vit, Eoratiif p. 45, Reiff. Venerunt in manus meas et elegi sub
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_3:0.0500:I do not doubt that these arguments might be multiplied,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_4:0.0000:and perhaps be thought strong enough to make a powerful
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_5:0.0000:case against the Augustan epoch of the poem. My own
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_6:0.0000:impression — I will not say conviction — is on the other
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_7:0.0000:side. Elaborate apologies of this kind become less and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_8:0.0000:less effective in proportion as they are removed from the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_9:0.0000:age of the person they defend. No one can believe the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_10:0.0000:hexameter Panegyric of Piso to have been composed long
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_11:0.0000:after Piso's death. Particular allusions that dwell in the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_13:0.0000:draughts or chess, would be natural from. a contemporary,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_14:0.0000:ridiculous, if not impossible, when the player had long been
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_15:0.0000:dead, and the game itself probably forgotten. Now the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_16:0.0250:MaecencLs has several such particular ref erencea
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_17:0.0250:I. Nothing is better attested than Maecenas' passion for
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_18:0.0000:gems (Macrob. 8. ii. 4. 12, Isid. Orig, xix. 32); two such
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_19:0.0000:allusions are believed to occur, Maec. 19 Vincit uulgaris^

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_27:0.0000:antiquary, Peiresc, traced a reference to a Tiberian gem
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_28:0.0000:representing the chief members of the Augustan family,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_29:0.0000:conspicuously DrusuSy a laurelled youth of beauteous
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_30:0.0000:features, who mounted on a winged steed seems to be
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_31:0.0000:soaring to the sky, possibly as identified with Hesperus
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0020_32:0.0500:the ephebe beloved by Venus, quern Venus ante alios

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_3:0.0250:in the person of Maecenas ^ in uu. 59-65, correspond closely
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_4:0.0500:to the description given by Velleius^ of Antony on his
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_5:0.0000:returning from his Parthian expedition to Alexandria.

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_7:0.0000:an episode which the writer of Maecenas has transferred by
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_8:0.0000:a not unnatural adaptation to the subject of his own poem,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_9:0.0000:was no doubt well known in Rome at the time : it would
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_10:0.0000:be out of date, if not forgotten, some years later, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_11:0.0000:would, especially in the inartistic fonn in which the poem
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_12:0.0250:presents it, be impossible two or three centuries after the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_13:0.0250:event.

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_17:0.0000:seems to be implied by the opening words of Horace's first

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_19:0.0000:expreas statement of Dion Cassius li. 3, and not mentioned
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_20:0.0250:by most of the authors who speak of the battle. Would
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_21:0.0000:our poet have gone out of his way to emphasize a fact
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_22:0.0000:which was, when he wrote, generally discredited, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_23:0.0000:which was likely, as against history, to rouse suspicion or
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_24:0.0000:cavil ? But if the poem appeared at a time when the fight
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_25:0.0500:was still recent, it would merely rank with the other
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_26:0.0000:merit of a valid reason for the identification. Both Bellerophon and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_27:0.0000:Drusus were lamed, the former by falling from his horse (Find. Isthm.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_28:0.0000:vii. 44, Schol. Find. Olymp. xiii. 130), the latter by his horse falling on
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0021_29:0.0250:him and breaking his leg (Li v. Epit. 140 ex fractura equo super cms eius

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_6:0.0500:character of Maecenas, and which as we have seen is
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_7:0.0250:emphasized by the triple repetition of the word in the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_9:0.0500:so strongly by a writer removed at any distance of time
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_10:0.0500:from the personal existence of Maecenas.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_11:0.0000:I lean then to an early date for the composition of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_12:0.0000:Elegies, perhaps within a year of Maecenas' death, perhaps
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_13:0.0250:some years later, hardly as late as the time of Seneca.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_14:0.0000:Little or nothing, I believe, can be argued from the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_15:0.0000:language, very little from the metre. The diction is
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_16:0.0250:classical and in no way belongs to a period of decline:
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_17:0.0000:its few peculiarities such as toi^osus applied to a knotted
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_18:0.0000:club, omniperita used of Medea, sacerdoa of Ganymede ;
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_19:0.0000:the position of -que very late in the sentence, the fond-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_20:0.0000:ness for assonances, 50 Marie eedente decent, 65 talaria

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_22:0.0000:res magnis, 150 magnum magni are such as belong to the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_23:0.0000:author, not to the time. If we might restore an Oriental
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_31:0.0000:being thus designated, the writer might be a Syrian (cf . 1 9
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_32:0.0000:Berytus) or at least a native of some region of the East.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_33:0.0250:The disyllabic ending of the pentameter is observed through-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0022_34:0.0500:out; and the peculiarly Ovidian combination huius et

elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_12:0.0000:nothing, however, can be inferred from them as to which
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_13:0.0000:of the two was written first ; and still less is it possible to
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_14:0.0250:believe that they were written by the same one man, in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_15:0.0250:spite of the support which such a view may seem to receive
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_20:0.0000:is preserved. They fall into two classes, (i) Of the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_21:0.0000:first class the best representative is the Bruxellensisj of
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_22:0.0000:which a collation was published by Grosse in Fleckei-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_23:0.0000:sen's Jahrhiicher for 1869, p. 278, It contains the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_24:0.0000:whole poem. Somewhat earlier in date are two eleventh-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_25:0.0000:century codices, Parisinus 16236 containing uu. 1-43, and
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_26:0.0000:the Mellicensis (Molk, near Vienna) which has preserved
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_27:0.0500:the first 25. Paris 16236 was first collated by Chatelain;
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_28:0.0250:the Molk Ciodex by Schenkl, who thought it would have
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_29:0.0000:been, if preserved entire, the best of our extant sources.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_30:0.0000:Of these three I have myself re-collated the two first at
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_31:0.0000:Brussels and Paris: a collation of the Mellicensis made
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_32:0.0000:by Schenkl was most generously sent to me by his son.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_33:0.0500:Prof. H. Schenkl, of Graz. Much later in date (cent, xv)
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0023_34:0.0500:are Arundel 133 in the British Museum, Phillipps 7283,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_2:0.0000:a Roman physician of the early seventeenth century, now
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_3:0.0000:in the Bodleian. Heinsius and Burmann cite most of its
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_4:0.0000:more prominent variants : such others as have any
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_5:0.0000:value will be found in my forthcoming Appendix Ver-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_6:0.0000:giliana. These three MSS. are all of the fifteenth century,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_7:0.0000:but belong to the same class as the three earlier.
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_8:0.0000:(2) The second class comprises two MSS., one in the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_9:0.0000:Vatican, 3269, the other at Leyden, Voss. Lat. O. 96. Both
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_10:0.0000:agree in appending to the end of the Maecenas the words
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_11:0.0000:Finit elegia inuenta ab enoc in dacia, from which we
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_12:0.0000:may believe that Enoc of Ascoli discovered a copy of it
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_13:0.0000:either in Denmark or, as I myself think more likely, in
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_14:0.0000:Hungary. At any rate there is extant in the Bylands
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_15:0.0000:Library at Manchester a copy of Henry the Eighth's
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_16:0.0250:* Defence of the Seven Sacraments against Martin Luther,'
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_17:0.0000:which has preserved in the king's own handwriting the
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_18:0.0500:words Regi Daciae, i. e. presented to the King of Hungary,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_26:0.0500:' SubscHptio* inuenta ab enoc in dacia ; but its compeer Vat,
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_30:0.0250:Though in many cases accident has determined the con-
elegiaeinmaecen00elligoog_0024_31:0.0000:junction of particular authors in the same MS., it may not be

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0025_7:0.0500:tellectual to my mind of all the studies of his face, to
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0025_19:0.0500:ually taken up the calling of letters, composing verse
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0025_22:0.0000:It is not generally known that Lincoln, shortly be-

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0025_28:0.0250:poetic spirit and metrical art to Whittier's "The Pris-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_0:0.0500:INTRODUCTION
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_4:0.0250:parody. It is true, as suggested it might be, that I have never
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_5:0.0000:seen Poe's "Raven"; and I very well know that a parody is
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_8:0.0500:polecat, self-considered, to afford one several hearty laughs. I
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_9:0.0000:think four or five of the last stanzas are decidedly funny, par-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_13:0.0250:think you ask me who is the author of the piece I sent you, and
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_14:0.0250:that you do so ask as to indicate a slight suspicion that I myself
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_15:0.0250:am the author. Beyond all question, I am not the author. I
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_16:0.0250:would give all I am worth, and go in debt, to be able to write so
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_17:0.0250:fine a piece as I think that is. Neither do I know who is the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_18:0.0250:author. I met it in a straggling form in a newspaper last summer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_23:0.0250:thinking I might aid some to carry the State of Indiana for Mr.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0026_24:0.0250:Clay, I went into the neighborhood in that State in which I was

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_33:0.0250:symbolism, and that subtle reminiscence of a great

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_35:0.0500:stands to us as Homer did to the ancients — it excels the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_36:0.0500:finest gem to be found in poetic cabinets from the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_38:0.0500:written in the typography of verse, with capitalized

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_41:0.0000:a poem by academic minds. Had Walt Whitman com-

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0032_43:0.0250:it would now appear in every anthology of poetry pub-

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_6:0.0500:from Lincoln's own manner of writing the speech as
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_9:0.0500:by Lincoln, the greatest, indeed, yet produced in
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_10:0.0500:America, may be preferably read in the original form
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_12:0.0500:especially if they are teachers of literature, will pardon,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_13:0.0500:for the sake of others less cultivated in poetic taste,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_20:0.0250:this classic beauty of expression, only by great struggle.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_21:0.0500:He became a poet of the first rank only by virtue of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_22:0.0250:his moral spirit. He was continually correcting defi-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_23:0.0500:ciencies in his character, which were far greater than
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_28:0.0000:having allowed a borrowed book to be ruined by rain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_32:0.0500:the book was a cherished possession, required him to
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_33:0.0500:do the work in repayment, and that Lincoln not only
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_34:0.0250:did it grudgingly, but afterwards lampooned the man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_35:0.0250:so severely in satiric verse that he was ashamed to
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_40:0.0500:recognized his moral obliquity, and curbed his propen-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_41:0.0250:sity for satire, which was a case of that "exercise of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_42:0.0500:natural faculty" which affects all gifted persons. And
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_44:0.0500:and asked pardon of those whom he had ridiculed. The
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_45:0.0500:true Lincoln is a far better example to boys than the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_11:0.0500:for their attainment in the case of his intellectual de-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_13:0.0500:tions proceeded apace. Lincoln at first was a shallow

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_17:0.0500:self the high-spirited young men of the West. Some

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_22:0.0250:closely, for Lincoln's mind could not be profoundly in-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_24:0.0500:that a revered statesman was weak upon a crucial
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_25:0.0500:moral issue, he repressed his innate tendency to loyalty
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_26:0.0500:and rejected him. Thus, after a visit to Henry Clay
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_31:0.0250:light he himself possessed on the subject was clearer
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_32:0.0250:than that of his old leader. The eulogy which he de-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0035_33:0.0500:livered on the death of Clay, which occurred shortly
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_0:0.0500:INTRODUCTION
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_7:0.0250:war, had failed utterly of its intended effect, probably
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_8:0.0500:because of its trimming partisan tone. In 1854 he

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_20:0.0250:Lincoln had become a great reader, was apparent, as
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_21:0.0500:indicated by a quotation from the dramatist, and an
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_22:0.0500:application to Senator Douglas of the scene of Lady
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_23:0.0000:Macbeth trying to wash out the indelible stain upon
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0036_38:0.0500:to buy your slave at a speculative price. If you can-

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_42:0.0500:wardly, the most loyal to the newly crowned king,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_43:0.0500:secretly he could scarcely contain his impatience at the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_44:0.0500:obstacles still in the way of his own elevation. He
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_45:0.0500:appears upon the stage, just after the crowning of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0039_0:0.0250:POETIC SPIRIT OF LINCOLN
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0039_12:0.0250:earnest, that I was not sure but that he had made a
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0039_13:0.0250:mistake in the choice of a profession, considerably, as
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0039_14:0.0250:may be imagined, to his amusement. Mr. Sinclair has
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_4:0.0500:choice of subjects and in style of treatment there is
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_5:0.0250:seen an almost discreditable stooping of a man of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_7:0.0250:lar taste of the West at the time. In the first lecture
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_8:0.0500:Lincoln presented the statistics of the water power of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_9:0.0000:Niagara Falls for each minute, and led his hearers from
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_10:0.0250:this base to the "contemplation of the vast power the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_11:0.0500:sun is constantly exerting in the quiet noiseless opera-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_13:0.0500:at this point he stopped short of his duty as an edu-

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_28:0.0500:jocose remarks about them to be current, he said:

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_36:0.0250:as President in the works of "Petroleum V. Nasby"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_41:0.0500:his own power of witty expression to a degree excel-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_42:0.0000:ling that of the writers he admired, and in quality of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0040_43:0.0000:product, if not in quantity (for the greater part of the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_6:0.0500:he overcome the obsession of melancholy in his nature
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_7:0.0500:which was the mood in which he resorted to poetry,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_8:0.0500:and which early limited his taste for it to verse of a sad
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_9:0.0500:and reflective kind, might have become a literary crafts-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_17:0.0500:mystical. In his normal and tranquil state of mind,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_18:0.0500:'The Last Leaf,' by Oliver Wendell Holmes, was his
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_20:0.0500:in the realm of oratory by the power of his poetic spirit
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_22:0.0500:done in other fields of literature. On the theme of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_23:0.0500:slavery, where his unerring moral sense had free sway,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_24:0.0500:he became our supreme orator, transcending even
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_25:0.0250:Webster in grandeur of thought and beauty of its ex-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_26:0.0250:pression. His periods are not as sonorous as the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_27:0.0250:Olympian New England orator's, but their accents will
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_32:0.0500:ture of the Constitution, is even now borne along,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0041_33:0.0500:because of the uplifting ideality which Lincoln gave
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_5:0.0500:and, making it the exhortation of his speech, gave to it
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_7:0.0500:highly resolve * * * that government of the people,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_12:0.0500:of his first inaugural address. The President-elect had
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_15:0.0500:what policy he would adopt toward the seceded States,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_16:0.0500:to Seward, his chosen Secretary of State, for criticism
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_17:0.0500:and suggestion. Mr. Seward approved the argument,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_20:0.0500:and despondency in the East." He submitted two
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_25:0.0000:naturedly to rally him. It is evidence of Lincoln's pre-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_26:0.0000:dilection for poetic language, at least at the close of a
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0042_27:0.0250:speech, that he adopted the latter paragraph. It ran:

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_13:0.0250:In so far as the poem has an inner meaning, y
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_14:0.0250:Kndymion must be identified with the poet as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_15:0.0000:Man. The Moon represents "Poetry" or the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_16:0.0250:Ideality of desired objects, The prin- Allegory of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_17:0.0250:ciple of Beauty in all tilings : it is Endymion.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_18:0.0250:the supersensuous quality which makes all
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_19:0.0500:desired objects ideal ; and Cynthia, as moon-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_21:0.0250:he ideal beauty or love of woman : and in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_22:0.0500:so far as she is also actually the Moon as well
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_23:0.0000:as the Indian lady, — who clearly represents real
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_24:0.0000:or sensuous passion, — it follows that the love of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_25:0.0000:woman is in its essence the same with all love
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0007_26:0.0250:of beauty ; and this proposition and its converse
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_1:0.0250:Moon with his passion, iii. 142 seq., that is, he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_2:0.0500:General sees beauty or "poetry" or ideality
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_3:0.0250:meaning. j n j^ desire. This Ideality, assum-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_4:0.0000:ing the form of the goddess, that is, of woman,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_5:0.0500:which it is* makes him renounce ambition
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_7:0.0000:humanise the ideality of his passion ; and this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_8:0.0000:comes about by his contact with the mystery
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_9:0.0500:of life, and by sympathy with dead lovers'
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_10:0.0500:tragedies ; and this sympathy leaves him a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_12:0.0250:falls, as he thinks, from his faith ; and his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_13:0.0000:sensuous passion, coming into sudden contact
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_14:0.0000:with his old ideals, vanishes at one moment
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_15:0.0250:quite away, and leaves him a prey to utter
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_16:0.0000:despair, iv. 507 seq. ; and he is at discord
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_17:0.0250:with himself, until he unexpectedly discovers
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_21:0.0250:the Moon, is represented as falling in love with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_22:0.0000:man, merely implies selection or election, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_24:0.0000:to those men who feel supernatural visitations
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_25:0.0500:{End. i. 795), such as are the Visionaries of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_26:0.0000:Revision of Hyperion. Also, to follow Keats'
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0008_27:0.0500:meaning, it must not be lost sight of that when
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_0:0.0500:ALLEGORY OF ENDYMION 15
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_1:0.0250:Endymion is visited by Cynthia, he never re-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_2:0.0000:cognises her to be the Moon,* although her
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_3:0.0500:advent was heralded by " the loveliest moon,"
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_5:0.0250:till Book I V. 430, &c. ; and so, when he finds
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_6:0.0500:himself loving both Cynthia and the Indian
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_8:0.0000:love, the Moon, as distinct from them, and says
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_9:0.0500:that he has a triple soul. There is no doubt
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_10:0.0000:about this, and it seems to me one of the two
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_11:0.0000:keys to the allegory. That it has escaped the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_12:0.0000:attention of diligent readers is a proof that it is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_13:0.0000:not insisted on with sufficient clearness in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_14:0.0250:poem, and it is a good example of the lack of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_15:0.0250:definition in the presentation of Keats' main
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_18:0.0500:a legend, and he never, so far as I symbolism
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_19:0.0250:know, stated that he intended his of the moon.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_20:0.0000:poem for an allegory (unless this is implied in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_21:0.0500:ii. 838-9), so that it may naturally shock the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0009_25:0.0250:may be arrived at in the simplest way : the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_7:0.0500:known, be taken for a symbol of the other
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_8:0.0250:unknown causes, or of that which is common to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_11:0.0500:iii. 142-187 (and see especially lines 163-169)
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_13:0.0250:with these explanations, readable as a whole,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_14:0.0500:suggestive of meaning, and full of shadowy out-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0010_15:0.0500:lines of mysterious truth.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_1:0.0250:lost sight of in its necessary modifications than
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_2:0.0000:that it was not intended in its proper home be-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_3:0.0000:neath the earth's crust ; III. Under sea = Water ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_5:0.0250:Natural beauty; II. The mysteries of earth ; III.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_7:0.0250:satisfaction. The first idea needs little comment :
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_8:0.0250:the last three books are concerned with states of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_10:0.0250:the poet's experience ; and here he must be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_11:0.0000:regarded as a searcher for truth rather than as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_12:0.0000:full prophet. What the mysteries of earth are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_13:0.0500:will appear in the explanation of Sleep and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_14:0.0250:Poetry. Their region " beneath in the earth "
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_15:0.0250:is moonless, *>., unlovely, and oppresses Endy-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_20:0.0250:munion with Cynthia herself. After this " the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_21:0.0250:blank amazements amaze no more," and he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_22:0.0250:meets with Alpheus and Arethusa. The reason
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_24:0.0500:are two lovers, who, like Endymjon himself,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_26:0.0500:passion underground, whence they are destined,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_27:0.0250:as he too is, to arrive again at the upper air
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_28:0.0250:through the sea. So in the third book the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0011_29:0.0500:story of Glaucus and Scylla has a similar fit-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_1:0.0250:ness. Glaucus is a mortal, who, of his own
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_3:0.0250:straight into the " secrets of Death " from the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_4:0.0500:world of natural beauty, where he was living
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_5:0.0250:on the brink of them. Scylla may have done
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_6:0.0250:the same ; but the general meaning of this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_10:0.0250:night are dimly seen. The secrets of Death are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_12:0.0000:there are two kinds — the first, the earthly magic
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_13:0.0500:or witchcraft of Circe, who is " arbitrary queen
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_14:0.0250:of sense," and can gratify the sense but not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_15:0.0500:resolve the secrets of Death, whose evil power
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_16:0.0500:she seems rather to aid ; and the second, a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_21:0.0250:Rev. of Hyperion (q.v.), but whether Glaucus
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_23:0.0250:End. iii. 327-337, 122, &c), or whether Death
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_26:0.0500:I cannot guess. It seems intended that the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_27:0.0500:sorrow of the secrets of Death can only be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0012_28:0.0500:surmounted and their magic resolved by a soul
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_0:0.0250:IDEA OF WOMAN 19
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_5:0.0250:reading, and it must always, though most con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_6:0.0000:secutive in narration, please the least, even
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_7:0.0500:though a key should be found for it. Of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_8:0.0000:four books, of almost equal length, the fourth
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_9:0.0500:reads by far the shortest. As for the beauties
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_11:0.0500:reader will find them for himself, if he will be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_12:0.0250:patient with the defects that so curiously hide
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_13:0.0500:them. Of these I would say no more here, if
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_14:0.0250:they did not very many of them de- i dea of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_15:0.0000:pend on a lamentable deficiency in woman.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_16:0.0000:Keats' art, which, while it affects much of his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_17:0.0000:work, is brought into unusual prominence by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_18:0.0000:the subject of Endymion; and that is his very
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_19:0.0250:superficial and unworthy treatment of his ideal
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_20:0.0250:female characters. It may be partly accounted
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_21:0.0000:for thus : Keats' art is primarily objective and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_22:0.0250:pictorial, and whatever other qualities it has
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_23:0.0000:are as it were added on to things as perceived ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_24:0.0250:and this requires a satisfactory pictorial basis,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_25:0.0000:which, in the case of ideal woman, did not exist
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_26:0.0000:in Keats' time. Neither the Greek nor the Re-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_27:0.0250:naissance ideals were understood, and the thin
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_28:0.0250:convention of classicism, which we may see in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0013_29:0.0500:the works of West and Canova, was played out ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_2:0.0250:finding "nothing to be intense upon," turned to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_7:0.0500:the more ideal and abstract it sought to be,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_9:0.0000:portrait -painters only, like Lawrence, who,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_12:0.0250:and represented women whom we can still
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_14:0.0500:ment from which neither circumstances nor dis-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_15:0.0250:position provided him an escape. The social
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_16:0.0250:condition of his parents probably excluded him
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_17:0.0000:from contact with the best types, and he seems
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_20:0.0000:women's society ; and when he attributes this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_21:0.0250:to their not answering to his preconception of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_23:0.0500:among them. Certainly what appears to be the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_24:0.0250:delineation of his conception often offends taste
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_25:0.0000:without raising the imagination, and it reveals
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_26:0.0500:a plainly impossible foundation for dignified
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0014_28:0.0250:failed, as we shall see later. I conclude that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_0:0.0500:IDEA OF WOMAN 21
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_1:0.0250:spiritualised by being applied to an idea.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_2:0.0000:Whatever praise is given to Keats' work must
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_3:0.0250:always be with this reservation ; and he gene-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_8:0.0000:sonnets as Time's Sea, I cry your Mercy,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_9:0.0000:Bright Star, though perhaps not quite un-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0015_10:0.0000:tainted by this weakness if interpreted by the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_0:0.0500:22 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_1:0.0500:III. THE SHORT "ENDYMION" AND
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_6:0.0000:for "Endymion" was its original title, and it
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_7:0.0000:may be regarded as a prelude to the longer poem.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_8:0.0000:It was written in December 1816, and was more
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_11:0.0250:argument of the poem, though much disguised by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_12:0.0250:its objective manner, is carefully elaborated. It
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_13:0.0000:begins with a description of Nature as seen in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_14:0.0000:a walk in the then suburbs of London — already
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_15:0.0250:romantically remote from us — and from this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_16:0.0250:passes insensibly to other descriptions of Nature,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_18:0.0250:1 poetry, which promises to celebrate Nature (51,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_19:0.0250:■ &c). Then (1. 94 seq.\ in an unfortunate pas-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0016_20:0.0250:sage, maiden beauty intrudes, and then (113)
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_0:0.0500:"/ STOOD TIPTOE" 23
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_7:0.0500:unique in its bold and fanciful identification of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_11:0.0500:He then suggests that this ecstasy in Nature
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_12:0.0250:may have given origin not only to the music of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_13:0.0000:verse, but to the poetic ideas of such myths as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_14:0.0250:Psyche, Syrinx, and Narcissus, and lastly (181)
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_15:0.0000:of Endymion, asserting his preference for that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_16:0.0250:tale, and his wish to write it ; and the poem
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_17:0.0000:ends (210-242) with a passage of human sym-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_18:0.0000:pathy, as the direct effect of the marriage of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_21:0.0250:method, but I will take one other poem Sleep and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_22:0.0000:to illustrate it, the last in the first Poetr >-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_23:0.0500:volume, called Sleep and Poetry ; and it is con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_24:0.0500:veniently grouped here, because, like the one just
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_25:0.0000:noticed, it is in the same metre as Endymion, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0017_26:0.0000:both are good examples of Keats' early style.*
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0018_9:0.0250:The short analysis of it is thus. Sleep, which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0018_10:0.0500:figures the unawakened state of mind,t is for
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0018_11:0.0500:its gentle soothing and inspiring qualities (1-18,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0018_17:0.0250:(47—55), and prays to her for inspiration to pene-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0018_18:0.0000:trate the mysteries of Nature and human life
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_0:0.0250:SLEEP AND POETRY 25
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_1:0.0500:Then in an important passage (101-162), to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_5:0.0500:known invective against the Augustan school,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_6:0.0500:and his prophecy of the coming revival ; and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_7:0.0000:at 235 a definition of the true object of poetry,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_8:0.0000:to comfort mankind ; implying sympathy with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_10:0.0000:end, is his peroration to his first publication,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_11:0.0000:an apology for presumption, a determination to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_12:0.0000:write, a tribute to the sympathetic support of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_13:0.0000:his friends, a description of his refuge in Leigh
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_14:0.0500:Hunt's study, and he ends his book saying of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_26:0.0500:boyhood — mere animal pleasure ; 2nd. simple
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0019_28:0.0500:pleasure in nature, i.e. pleasure accompanied
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_4:0.0500:"I compare human life to a large Mansion of many
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_5:0.0250:apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_6:0.0000:of the rest being as yet shut upon me. The first we
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_7:0.0000:step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_8:0.0000:which we remain as long as we do not think. We re-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_9:0.0000:main there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_10:0.0000:of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_11:0.0000:bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it ; but are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_12:0.0000:at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_13:0.0000:the thinking principle within us. We no sooner get into
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_14:0.0000:the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_15:0.0250:of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_16:0.0000:the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but plea-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_17:0.0000:sant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_18:0.0000:delight. However, among the effects this breathing is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_19:0.0000:father of, is that tremendous one of sharpening one's
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_20:0.0000:vision into the heart and nature of Man — of convincing
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_21:0.0000:one's nerves that the world is full of Misery and Heart-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_22:0.0000:break, Pain, Sickness, and Oppression— whereby this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_23:0.0250:Chamber of Maiden - Thought becomes gradually
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_24:0.0000:darkened, and at the same time, on all sides of it,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_25:0.0000:many doors are set open — but all dark — all leading to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_26:0.0000:dark passages — We see not the balance of good and evil
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0020_27:0.0000:— we are in a mist — we are now in that state — We feel

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_2:0.0250:merely borrowing from Wordsworth, but there
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_4:0.0500:learnt some of his obstinate questionings from
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_16:0.0250:opening lines, and incidentally, though not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_17:0.0000:without full contrastive purpose, he describes
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_18:0.0500:it last among his images of human life, where
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_19:0.0000:" knowledge is sorrow, sorrow is wisdom, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_20:0.0500:wisdom is folly." These images are of life
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_21:0.0500:considered first as a mere atomic movement
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_23:0.0250:brink of destruction, then as a budding hope,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_24:0.0250:then as an intellectual distraction, then as an
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_25:0.0000:ecstatic glimpse of beauty, and lastly as an in-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0021_26:0.0500:stinctive pleasure ; and this corresponds exactly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0022_0:0.0500:23 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_0:0.0250:SLEEP AND POETRY 29
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_16:0.0500:poetry is as obscure as the " dark passages "
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_17:0.0500:themselves ; but it must be acknowledged that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_18:0.0000:it is a definitely aimed attempt to express a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_19:0.0250:definitely conceived thought in poetical terms.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_20:0.0000:If the imagery fails to define the poet's
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_22:0.0500:is hardly to be reached in this field ; and if
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_23:0.0500:there does lie behind Keats' poetry a meaning
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_24:0.0250:which it is impossible to make absolutely dis-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_25:0.0000:tinct in his objective manner, then it is not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0023_26:0.0000:strange that his poetry should attract many
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_1:0.0000:persons alive at this moment in England, who,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_2:0.0500:Poetry of if tnev could only give poetic expres-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_4:0.0000:which they are moved in the presence of natural
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_5:0.0000:beauty, would be one and all of them greater
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_8:0.0000:in rare touches, and seems to be the reward of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_9:0.0000:„ ., consummate art.- The old simile,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_13:0.0250:tion in an almost barbaric taste, may be used
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_14:0.0250:for a device to secure something of this evasive
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_15:0.0500:wonder. The poet having put his reader into
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0024_27:0.0500:carelessly diffused,"— which is its excuse and

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_3:0.0500:Nothing can exceed the force of such a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_4:0.0250:reserved method as this. The intention is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_5:0.0250:artistically concealed by the very means which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_6:0.0250:are taken to prepare the effect, and the picture
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_7:0.0000:bursts unexpectedly on the reader with all the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_8:0.0250:force of a landscape seen suddenly upon reach-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_9:0.0250:ing the brow of a hill. But it is of course much
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_10:0.0000:more difficult to picture ideas than moods. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_11:0.0000:purely objective picturing of an idea in poetry
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_12:0.0000:is very like a musical presentation ; and as instru-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_13:0.0000:mental music can give a mood, but cannot be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_14:0.0500:trusted to suggest the simplest idea without the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_15:0.0250:interpretation of words or action either accom-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_16:0.0000:panying or preparing it, so the poetic picture
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_17:0.0250:requires a statement of its intention ; and even
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_18:0.0250:then it seems as vague in itself as music,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_20:0.0500:other intentions. Keats gives a statement of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_21:0.0250:the intention of his charioteer in 123-125 and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_22:0.0250:157, and also by a few words in the picture ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_23:0.0250:yet it must be confessed that he is not quite
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_24:0.0500:successful ; and if it may be said that in Words-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0025_25:0.0250:worth the statement is overdone, and that what

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_11:0.0500:and in that time he fell under the in-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_12:0.0500:fluence of Milton, recognising in Paradise Lost
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_13:0.0250:the model of that workmanship, the neglect of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_14:0.0500:which had spoiled his first attempt. Hyperion

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_18:0.0000:that the events are supramundane is met by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_21:0.0500:Pandemonium, and by placing the scene on
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_22:0.0250:earth, where his romantic love of Nature could
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_24:0.0250:sky, which is luxuriantly described, and he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_25:0.0000:is pictured as resting awhile on the clouds,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0026_26:0.0250:where he is addressed by Coelus from space ;

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_1:0.0500:The opening promises well ; we are conscious p*
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_3:0.0500:both sweet and strong, alive with imagination
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_4:0.0500:and tenderness. There and throughout the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_5:0.0250:poem are passages in which Keats, without losing
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_6:0.0000:his own individuality, is as good as Milton, where
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_7:0.0000:Milton is as good as Virgil ;* and such passages
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_8:0.0250:rank with the best things that Keats ever did ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_10:0.0250:shadowed by Milton, while definite passages
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_11:0.0250:of the Paradise Lost are recalled, and in some
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_12:0.0500:places the imitation seems frigid. Milton's
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_13:0.0000:grammar and prosody are apparently aimed at,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_14:0.0000:but they are not strictly kept, nor is the poem
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_15:0.0000:maintained at the Miltonic elevation. Here
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_16:0.0250:and there, too, a fanciful or weak expression
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_17:0.0500:betrays the author of Endymicm. When, in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_20:0.0250:it was not finally discarded till five months
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_22:0.0000:he attributes his dissatisfaction to the style ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_23:0.0000:but one cannot read to the end without a con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_24:0.0000:viction that the real hindrance lay deeper ; for
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_25:0.0500:although we may say that this torso of Keats' is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_26:0.0250:the only poem since Milton which has seriously
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0027_27:0.0000:challenged the epic place, it is to the style mainly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_2:0.0000:interest : like Endymion, it is all imagination ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_3:0.0000:or, if we should accept Keats' personifications as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_4:0.0000:sufficiently real for his purpose, even then the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_5:0.0250:poem fails in conduct. The first two books
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_6:0.0000:describe the conditions of the older gods, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_7:0.0000:are impassioned with defeat, dismay, and col-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_10:0.0500:and irresistible ; but there is no change in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_11:0.0000:colour of the poem ; of the two deities intro-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_12:0.0000:duced, Apollo is weeping and raving, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_13:0.0250:Mnemosyne, who has deserted the old dynasty
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_20:0.0250:of that ; a languor which, though it has now
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_21:0.0000:generally left the language, lingers in the main
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_22:0.0250:design. That Keats was conscious, too, that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_23:0.0500:some of his earlier weaknesses were still visible
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_24:0.0500:will appear when we come to consider the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_25:0.0500:Revision of Hyperion; but his own criticism
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0028_27:0.0000:artificial, and he confesses in a letter of Septem-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_8:0.0000:great deal, and remind one of Milton's am-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_9:0.0000:bitious avoidance of Shakespeare in his own
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_10:0.0250:later work. But Keats' condemnation of gram-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_17:0.0250:not afford to be imitative. But he had not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_18:0.0250:abused inversion in Hyperion, nor is it ab-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_19:0.0250:sent from his revision, nor wholly from his

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_23:0.0000:scribed by use, and if that does not suit the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_24:0.0000:sense, correction is made by vocal intonation :
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_25:0.0000:but the first thing that a writer must do is to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_26:0.0000:get his words in the order of his ideas, as hei
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0029_27:0.0000:wishes them to enter the reader's mind ; and

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0030_4:0.0500:the substantive, and this is in most cases its
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0030_5:0.0000:proper place,* and for this reason alone descrip-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0030_18:0.0500:and a preference for this style over more

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0031_10:0.0000:Hyperion, we must remember that Hjrperioa
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0031_12:0.0500:work,— for it was between his beginning the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0031_13:0.0500:Hyperion in September 1818 to September

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_2:0.0250:and gloom, had betaken himself again to com-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_3:0.0000:position. By some paradoxical devilry, more-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_4:0.0000:over, he devoted the best hours of the day to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_5:0.0250:supplying the market with a comic poem in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_6:0.0250:Byronic vein, The Cap and Bells, and worked in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_9:0.0250:itself enough to account for any inferiority in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_10:0.0500:the execution. This fragment is very interest-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_11:0.0000:ing ; first, it shows a new departure in style ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_14:0.0500:and the early poems ; thirdly, the most mature
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_15:0.0500:attempt that he ever made to express some of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_16:0.0000:his own convictions concerning human life. It
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_17:0.0500:is in this third aspect that the chief interest lies,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_18:0.0000:and it is strange that its matter should not have
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_19:0.0500:prevented the Revision from passing for a first
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_20:0.0500:draught, with such critics as might overlook the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_24:0.0000:should not have deceived, for, in spite of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_25:0.0250:inefficient execution, it is in some respects an
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_26:0.0250:advance ; it aims at a greater severity and has
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_27:0.0250:a more thoughtful power than any of Keats'
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0032_29:0.0500:tions of the passages common to the two

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0034_7:0.0250:embodiments, and in the sort of connection con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0034_8:0.0000:ceived between his vision of doom and his own

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_6:0.0500:and from this it follows that the old Hyperion
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_8:0.0250:rum. impossible that Keats would have
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_9:0.0000:forced into an allegory a poem which he had
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_10:0.0250:conceived and written without such intention.

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_15:0.0500:ment, which is that there is a self-destructive
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_17:0.0000:beauty, and not force, is the law of this flux
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_18:0.0250:or change. It seems also probable that Keats
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_19:0.0500:intended to make Hyperion and Mnemosyne
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_20:0.0500:instruct Apollo, and thus to show Light and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_21:0.0000:Song passing into union and perfection out of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_22:0.0250:elemental chaos and crudeness. However this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_23:0.0250:may be, Oceanus bids Saturn take comfort in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0036_24:0.0500:his dethronement, " for," he says,

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_9:0.0250:And this will serve to guide us at once to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_10:0.0250:separate the Revision into two parts, the first
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_11:0.0250:down to line 266, which is the new allegory,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_14:0.0500:latter part we may neglect ; it is only a maim-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_15:0.0000:ing of his earlier fine work; but the first part is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_16:0.0500:original, and though it opens badly, and has
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_17:0.0000:some poor places, it is from line 19 onwards,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_21:0.0000:that this allegory is a description of Keats' own
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0037_22:0.0250:life, and of his latest convictions, and one would
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_3:0.0500:which followed the draught represents that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_4:0.0500:complete and excited absorption by poetry
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_5:0.0250:which Keats describes himself as suffering
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_6:0.0500:when he was writing Endymion, and the swoon
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_7:0.0250:would be that state of selfish isolation into which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_8:0.0250:he fell in his Miltonic period. His awaking in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_9:0.0250:the temple is his recovery from this to a sympathy
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_10:0.0250:with the miseries of the world ; and the temple
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_11:0.0500:itself is the temple of Knowledge, which it is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_12:0.0250:death for a visionary to enter if he have not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_13:0.0250:that sympathy. The steps to the altar are the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_14:0.0500:struggle of such a mind to reach truth : and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_15:0.0000:truth itself is revealed by knowledge. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_16:0.0500:leaves burning on the altar are years of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_18:0.0250:Whether or no any or all of these points are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_19:0.0500:rightly interpreted, it is sure that the general
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_20:0.0000:meaning is, that though Keats conceived of the

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_26:0.0500:actual contact and sympathy with human misery
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_27:0.0250:and sorrow are the only school for real insight,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0038_28:0.0250:which is the reward of true human cbnduct, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_4:0.0000:be connected with moneo, and Memory is the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_5:0.0250:same as Knowledge, and she can admonish or

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_8:0.0500:a poet of a visionary. She is thus foster-mother

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_13:0.0000:as the opposite of that knowledge which is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_14:0.0250:memory. Compare Hyperion, iii., where
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_15:0.0250:Apollo "becomes immortal" by reading in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_16:0.0250:Mnemosyne's eyes, just as the poet is to do
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_17:0.0000:in the Revision* Thus the temple must be the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_18:0.0000:temple of Knowledge = Memory ;* and it is fit
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_19:0.0500:that Mnemosyne, the Memory of all things,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_25:0.0500:closed by a mighty mythical image of a dead
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_26:0.0250:^od, and an altar, beside which the goddess of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0039_27:0.0000:the memory of all change stands veiled in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_4:0.0000:meaning is now changed, and it should be com-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_5:0.0500:pared ; but in taking this allegory to interpret
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_6:0.0250:Keats' mind, it must be remembered first, that all
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_7:0.0500:the different states through which he may repre-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_9:0.0500:secutive in the sense that he may have been at
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_10:0.0250:one time more dominated by one view of things,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_11:0.0500:at another time by another ; and though in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_12:0.0250:changing strength of his convictions there may
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_13:0.0000:have been a real growth, yet the different feelings
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_14:0.0500:were most of them known to him almost from
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_17:0.0000:the period in which he most benefited mankind ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_18:0.0500:and he saw at the time the truth of the paradox,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_19:0.0250:and was tortured by the " solitariness," which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_20:0.0500:proved his sympathy to be alive ; and that very
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_21:0.0000:torture may have been his misery at the foot
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_22:0.0500:of the altar-stairs, on which, when he once
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_23:0.0250:stepped, they filled his freezing body with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_24:0.0000:natural heat. There is a great nobility in all
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_25:0.0000:this, and considering what vile treatment he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_26:0.0000:had met with, it is very beautiful that there is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_27:0.0000:not only no word of resentment, but no place
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_28:0.0250:for complaint : he takes all the blame on his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0040_29:0.0250:own unworthiness. But it is also very sad :

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_12:0.0250:tive poems by Keats, Isabella, The Eve of St.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_13:0.0250:Agnes, and Lamia. They are all famous for
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_14:0.0000:their beauty, and the first two, which are in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_15:0.0000:stanza, may be said to have become almost
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_19:0.0000:from the pictures of artists who took their
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_20:0.0000:subject from Keats as from the poem itself.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_21:0.0000:The story is unpleasant, and is the worst exe-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_22:0.0500:cuted of the three ; but the poet has overcome
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_23:0.0000:the gruesomeness with skill — he parentheti-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_24:0.0500:cally interrupts his narration to confess the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_25:0.0250:difficulty, — yet he seldom stays for many lines
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0041_26:0.0000:together above his weaker vein : the appear-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_1:0.0500:ance of Lorenzo's ghost to Isabella, from stanza
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_2:0.0500:xxxi. onwards, being the best sustained passage.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_3:0.0500:The poem has many examples of Keats' origi-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_4:0.0000:nality of imagination and felicity of phrase, but
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_5:0.0000:is tainted throughout by a characteristic segri-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_6:0.0250:tude of passion, which makes the best occasion
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_8:0.0500:exists between him and the school of paint-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_9:0.0500:ing which had Rossetti for its head. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_10:0.0500:lovers who "could not in the self-same man-

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_14:0.0500:ness," and the consciousness of something too
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_15:0.0000:horrible to speak of behind the scene ; with all
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_16:0.0500:the passionate faintness of the personages of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_17:0.0250:the romance, in whom, as in a faded tapestry,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_18:0.0000:the brilliance of the dresses has outlasted the

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_20:0.0250:this school so remarkable, that Keats may be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0042_21:0.0250:safely credited with a chief share of the parent-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_2:0.0000:bedesman," who has personally nothing what-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_3:0.0000:ever to do with the tale ; he provides con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_4:0.0250:trast to the revelry, which he introduces by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_5:0.0250:hearing it, and he also makes opportunity
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_6:0.0000:for describing his haunt in the chapel of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_7:0.0250:heroine's castle : but the chapel is never used
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_8:0.0000:again. The feast, too, which Porphyro sets
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_9:0.0250:out in Madeline's chamber is robbed of its
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_12:0.0500:have been woven in ; but they are selected in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_13:0.0250:sympathy with the story, and make some of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_14:0.0000:most successful colouring. The Eve of St.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_15:0.0250:Agnes is not only a passionate tale, but it is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_16:0.0000:very rich in the kind of beauty characteristic of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0043_17:0.0000:Keats, and contains high poetry both of diction

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_5:0.0250:tainty in which Keats found himself is easy to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_6:0.0250:explain. The metre in Chaucer's hands came
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_10:0.0000:and inflexions which have since become mute
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_17:0.0500:the change which necessarily came over the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_18:0.0000:rhymed heroic verse. It became heavier and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_19:0.0250:less adapted for narration, and at last was
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_20:0.0250:cast mechanically in polished couplets, which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_22:0.0500:classic grace, and were prescribed by the Uni-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_23:0.0000:versities as the only form in which they would
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_24:0.0000:recognise English poetry. Later poets have
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0044_25:0.0000:used different devices for lightening the metre,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_1:0.0500:successful in the quality of lightness, but it met
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_2:0.0000:with no favour, and the lightness was gained
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_5:0.0500:couplet and line units are reduced to a mini-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_6:0.0250:mum of value, and with these the rhyme value
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_7:0.0000:sinks, so that the unrhymed lines in the poem
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_8:0.0000:are scarcely noticed : on the other hand, the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_9:0.0500:verses are frequently tagged by evidently foisted
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_10:0.0250:rhymes. But in reading the first dozen lines of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_11:0.0250:Lamia, the problem seems solved ; all is both
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_12:0.0250:light and sure, and there are neither tags nor
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_14:0.0500:and a great deal of the poem is as good as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_15:0.0500:this. The device of separating the couplets by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_16:0.0250:a pause in the sense after the first rhyme is re-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_18:0.0500:twelve-syllable lines are introduced. But the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_19:0.0250:poem is not all equally well written, the whole
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_20:0.0000:passage, i. 300-350, where the subject does not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_23:0.0500:self-evident and offensive in this kind of verse
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_27:0.0250:giving great force to any unbroken couplets
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_28:0.0000:that were introduced. As for the triplets and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0045_29:0.0500:twelve-syllable lines, these are no doubt used
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_0:0.0500:52 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_1:0.0500:sometimes with skill, but among regular 'heroics '
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_11:0.0500:Tale, The Eve of St. Mark, written in eight-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_12:0.0250:syllable couplets with the same sort of latitude
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_17:0.0000:homeliness, and suits just as well the indoors
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_18:0.0250:picture, which is a light combination of mystery
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_19:0.0250:and real life ; and his mastery of all this, quite
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0046_20:0.0500:as much as his playful and charming imitation
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_0:0.0250:LAMIA S3
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_1:0.0250:ness, and her transformation has the same fault.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_2:0.0000:Words like rosy and phosphor assert them-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_3:0.0250:selves ; others are dressed at the call of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_4:0.0500:rhyme ; while very common expressions occa-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_5:0.0500:sionally produce a bathos, i. 201, 330, 335 ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_7:0.0250:correct his old faults ; for instance, in revising
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_8:0.0000:he appears to have written silejitly in ii. 134
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_9:0.0500:for silverly ; and Lamia is constructively the c /*
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_10:0.0500:most perfect of his three narratives. I remark
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_12:0.0250:of i. 44 do not agree with the daffodils of line
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_13:0.0000:184 : and I consider it a blot that Lycius should
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_14:0.0000:die at the end ; because he is killed by Apol-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_15:0.0000:lonius, who, if he could not rescue him, should
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_16:0.0000:have let him alone. Philosophy or Reason is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_17:0.0500:made unamiable : but I am afraid that Keats
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_18:0.0250:may have intended this ; and he makes Apol-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_19:0.0000:lonius laugh, which is almost diabolic. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_20:0.0250:general meaning is, no doubt, the antagonism
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_21:0.0000:of reason and pleasure, or of science and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_22:0.0000:imagination (ii. 229 seg.), or both ; and that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_23:0.0500:reason should take delight in destroying
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_24:0.0500:pleasure is only one of the ugly doctrines that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_25:0.0250:lurk beneath the text if it be read as a parable.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_26:0.0250:But it is very uncertain how much Keats in-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_27:0.0500:tended. He may have had in his mind the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0047_29:0.0500:and his catastrophe in the justifiable indifference
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_0:0.0500:54 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_3:0.0250:life engenders pride and egotism, but this pride
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_10:0.0500:Had Keats left us only his Odes, his rank
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_11:0.0250:among the poets would not be lower than it is,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_12:0.0500:for they have stood apart in literature, at least
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_13:0.0250:the six most famous of them ; and these were
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0048_18:0.0500:he discarded it. These are the six : 1. Psyche ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_0:0.0250:THE ODES 55
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_4:0.0000:Of the seven odes first enumerated, the first
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_5:0.0250:place must be given for its perfection to that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_6:0.0250:last composed— that is, the Ode to Autumn.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_8:0.0500:masterpieces of English poetry ; and unless it
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_10:0.0500:" Think not of them " in the 2nd line of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_11:0.0500:3rd stanza are somewhat awkwardly addressed
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_12:0.0000:to a personification of Autumn, I do not know
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_13:0.0250:that any sort of fault can be found in it. But
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_14:0.0250:though this is the best as a whole, it is yet left
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_15:0.0250:far behind by the splendour of the Nightingale,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_16:0.0250:in which the mood is more intense, and the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_18:0.0250:subject.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_21:0.0500:ancy, and of pleading and tender passionate
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_24:0.0250:exhibitions of musical skill. Whatever pain or
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_25:0.0500:sorrow may be expressed by it, it is idealised
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_26:0.0000:— that is, it is not the sorrow of a sufferer, but
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_27:0.0500:the perfect expression of sorrow by an artist,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_28:0.0000:who must have felt, but is not feeling ; and the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0049_29:0.0500:ecstasy of the nightingale is stronger than its
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_9:0.0250:it ; and in the penultimate stanza the thought
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_10:0.0250:is fanciful or superficial, — man being as im-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_11:0.0000:mortal as the bird in every sense but that of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_12:0.0000:sameness, which is assumed and does not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_13:0.0500:satisfy. The introduction, too, of the last stanza
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_14:0.0000:is artificial, while his choosing elf to rhyme* to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_15:0.0000:self* turns out disastrously ; and he loses
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_16:0.0250:hold of his main idea in the words " plaintive
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_17:0.0000:anthem," which, in expressing the dying away
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_18:0.0000:of the sound, changes its character. . No praise,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_19:0.0000:however, could be too high for those last six
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_20:0.0250:lines ; and if grammar and sense are a little
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_21:0.0250:obscure in the first ten, I could not name any
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_22:0.0250:English poem of the same length which con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_23:0.0250:tains so much beauty as this ode.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0050_24:0.0500:* The elf belongs to W. Brown of Tavistock, whom
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_0:0.0250:THE ODES 57
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_1:0.0250:Next to this I should rank Melancholy. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_2:0.0000:perception in this ode is profound, and no doubt
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_3:0.0500:experienced. The paradox that melancholy
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_4:0.0250:is most deeply felt by the organisation most
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_6:0.0250:observation of the reaction which satiety pro-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_14:0.0250:especially of the last stanza, it does not hit so
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0051_15:0.0500:hard as one would expect. I do not know
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_10:0.0500:the Grecia?i Urn. The thought as enounced in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_11:0.0250:the first stanza is the supremacy of ideal art
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_12:0.0250:over Nature, because of its unchanging expres-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_14:0.0250:but its amplification in the poem is unprogres-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_15:0.0250:sive, monotonous, and scattered, the attention
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_16:0.0500:being called to fresh details without result (see
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_19:0.0250:The last stanza enters stumbling on a pun, but
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0052_21:0.0500:sort of recovery with their forcible directness.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_0:0.0250:THE ODES 59
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_10:0.0250:Book I. is good enough in design. Pan is first
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_11:0.0250:invoked as ruler in dark and moist woods ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_12:0.0500:secondly, as the god to whom all natural pro-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_13:0.0000:ducts are sacred, with contrast of sunny places ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_14:0.0250:thirdly, as king of fauns and satyrs ; fourthly,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_15:0.0250:for six lines as farm-god. But this last idea has
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_16:0.0000:been anticipated by interpolation in the previous
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_17:0.0250:section. Then the last part of the ode connects
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_19:0.0500:expression But no more, however interpreted,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_20:0.0500:is unfortunate at the end of the ode. The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_21:0.0500:diction throughout is rich and the imagery
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_22:0.0250:chosen well for the work that it has to do in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_23:0.0250:the various aspects of the god's energy, the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_24:0.0000:different objects being seized and shown in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_25:0.0000:happy phrases full of knowledge and feeling ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_26:0.0000:and though it might perhaps have been better
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0053_28:0.0500:the last, rather than that the mysteries should
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_4:0.0000:these merits, nor has it won, like the others,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_6:0.0250:to the vagueness of the personification, caused
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_7:0.0000:by the variety of attributes and objects, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_8:0.0000:partly to the versification, which, though gene-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_9:0.0000:rally easy and fluent, pauses, especially in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_10:0.0500:second division, too frequently in the mid-line,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_11:0.0000:in the manner of tagging, and produces there
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_13:0.0250:foreign to the repose and finish which we look
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_15:0.0500:Lastly, as to the Ode to Sorrow in the 4th book
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_16:0.0250:of Endymion, I regard this as one of the greatest
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_17:0.0500:of Keats' achievements, and agree with all that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_18:0.0500:Mr. Sidney Colvin has said in its praise in his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_20:0.0250:opening, and the 1st and 4th stanzas especially
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_21:0.0000:are unequal to the rest, as is again the 3rd
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_22:0.0000:from the end, " Young stranger," which for its
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_25:0.0500:poverish the effect, and contain expressions
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_26:0.0000:which might put some readers off. If they
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_27:0.0000:would begin at the 5th stanza and omit the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_28:0.0250:3rd from the end, they would find little that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0054_29:0.0250:is not admirable. And, as it stands, the ode
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_2:0.0500:The pictorial description of the Bacchic pro-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_4:0.0250:romantic dreamy Orientalism, while the con-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_5:0.0500:cluding stanzas, returning to the first movement,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_6:0.0500:are as lovely as any Elizabethan lyric, and in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_7:0.0250:the same manner. The bold contrast and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_9:0.0000:and the few expressions which remind one that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_12:0.0250:VII. SONNETS.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_16:0.0250:laws and liberties of sonnet-writing have been
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_18:0.0000:usually classified by their differences in these
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_19:0.0500:minor particulars. But a more useful classi-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_21:0.0250:of thought. The typical sonnet is a reflective
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_22:0.0500:poem on love, or at least in some mood of love
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_23:0.0000:or desire, or absorbing passion or emotion ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_24:0.0000:and such a definition includes almost every-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0055_25:0.0500:thing which cannot be readily referred to some
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_4:0.0500:nally, as the name implies, an inscription : its
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_5:0.0000:business was to record some event or mark
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_6:0.0250:some place, and its excellence to raise an
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_8:0.0250:terseness with pathos, soon established a form
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_9:0.0000:which poets used for other purposes, until in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_10:0.0250:the hands of city wits the name wholly changed
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_12:0.0250:a piece of scandal, and the emotion such as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_13:0.0250:may be expressed by a well-bred jeer ; a sad
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_14:0.0250:fall from Simonides. The sonnet form has
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_16:0.0500:epigram, and the many varieties of the two
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_17:0.0000:have more than one point of contact ; but it
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_18:0.0250:is plain that an epigram proper cannot become
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_20:0.0250:this happens to exceed epigrammatic length,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_22:0.0000:inscriptions, — and such a hybrid may at least
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0056_23:0.0500:be separated off as an epigrammatic sonnet.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0057_18:0.0500:These examples may suffice, if it be noted
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0057_22:0.0500:secondly, that all these forms and others are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0058_0:0.0500:64 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0058_2:0.0250:places and books. And these hybrids come

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0058_13:0.0250:chosen, this would be made up almost equally
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_0:0.0500:SONNETS 65
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_10:0.0500:been selected and admired by some critics : it
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_11:0.0000:seems to me to be turgid and capricious, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_12:0.0250:hence unsuccessful. But all the first ten are ex-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_13:0.0250:tremely fine — the first eight being nearly faultless
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_15:0.0500:And if we pass from them to the next in merit,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_16:0.0500:there is a great fall. Such a list would contain
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_17:0.0250:Spenser a jealous honourer; Many the wonders ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_18:0.0250:Nymph of the downward smile j How many

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0059_22:0.0000:one of these which does not plainly fail, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_1:0.0500:Not to speak of the magnificence of the ten

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_7:0.0500:sciousness which is the common bane of sonnets,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_8:0.0500:and has got them a bad name among honest
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_10:0.0250:sonnets next to Shakespeare's. They are free
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_12:0.0250:try', and when they do fall, they do not fall stiffly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_13:0.0250:but negligently, and most of them are pleasant
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0060_15:0.0250:VIII. EPISTLES.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_1:0.0250:very poor, and they are in so far more like
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_2:0.0000:letters written in rhyme than poems in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_3:0.0000:form of letters, and they may all be taken with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_6:0.0000:less verse." The Epistle to Cowden Clarke is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_8:0.0500:rational argument, it is not worth defending
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_9:0.0000:from any condemnation for want of artistic
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_10:0.0250:form ; but it is in my opinion wrong to include
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_11:0.0250:the other early epistles and poems in this judg-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_12:0.0250:ment. In my previous analysis of two of these,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_17:0.0000:of it escapes the reader's attention, that is due
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_18:0.0250:to the lightness of the imaginative touch and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_19:0.0250:flight, which is a welcome escape from the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_20:0.0250:conscious pedantries of form, and, so long as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_21:0.0000:the sense is clear, a great merit. Indeed, if the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_23:0.0250:of their framework, they would be models of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_24:0.0250:what such epistles should be. Nos. 1 and 2
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_25:0.0250:must be passed over here. No. 4 is of great
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0061_28:0.0500:ful artistic movement of thought, just short of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0062_5:0.0500:i -12, very common ; they may be beautiful, as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0062_9:0.0500:such colouring, &c, question why they cannot,

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_4:0.0250:pessimism, but that he will not give way to

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_13:0.0000:let the fancy roam. In a letter to his brother,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_14:0.0250:January 18 19, Keats writes : "These are speci-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_15:0.0500:mens of a sort of rondeau which I think I
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_17:0.0250:idea amplified with greater ease and more de-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_18:0.0000:light and freedom than in the sonnet." The
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_19:0.0250:theme is stated in the first four lines, and then,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_20:0.0500:after an amplification without progress, these
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_21:0.0000:are used again in the last division to make
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_23:0.0500:the form seems good, simple, and attractive.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_25:0.0500:qualities of fluency and grace, and the statement
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0063_26:0.0250:of the subject is provocative of interest ; yet,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_2:0.0250:six lines, there is little other merit either of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_3:0.0000:thought or diction in the first two. Mr. M.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_4:0.0500:Arnold chose these and excluded the Fancy
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_8:0.0250:simple descriptions of nature, recalling U Allegro,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_9:0.0250:are often very beautiful ; and in the last division
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_10:0.0250:there is a sensuous passage done in the fine
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_16:0.0500:There are left now only the lyrical poems in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_17:0.0000:Lyrics in stanza, and easily first, holding a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_19:0.0000:belle da?ne sans mercu This occurs in a long
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_20:0.0500:journalistic letter from Keats to his brother
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_21:0.0000:in America, and is dated "Wednesday even-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_22:0.0250:ing," that is, April 28, 18 19. It seems as if
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_23:0.0000:he had composed it on that day, and written
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_24:0.0500:it down hastily from memory, so that he had
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_25:0.0250:to correct several mistakes afterwards ; and,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0064_27:0.0250:as if he was at the time unaware of its great
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_0:0.0250:LYRICAL POEMS 71
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_2:0.0250:differs from that in Keats' letter in one or
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_3:0.0250:two points ; and these may be corrections by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_4:0.0250:Keats, but the original first line will certainly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_5:0.0000:preserve the first version, which exists in Keats'
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_7:0.0250:one. " Wretched wight? the correction, is cold
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_8:0.0500:and poor, and fatal to the tragic motive of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_10:0.0500:detail, whereas the original u knight-at-arms"
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_12:0.0000:from real life, and the suggestion of armour is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_13:0.0250:of the greatest value to the general colouring.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_14:0.0000:It would be impertinence to praise this poem,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_16:0.0500:stands above the reach of criticism. For other
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_17:0.0500:reasons it is better not to criticise, " In a drear-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_18:0.0000:nighted December? which, after a very long
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_19:0.0000:interval indeed, must be placed next. This
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_21:0.0000:so, both for its beauty and originality, but the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_22:0.0000:latter quality proves expensive. And after this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_23:0.0000:poem there is another gap, for if we mention
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_24:0.0000:the next best lyrics, we come to such poems as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_25:0.0000:Meg Mcrrilies, and Where be you goings you
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_26:0.0000:Devon maid? which, as Lord Houghton printed
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_27:0.0250:it, omitting the second stanza, is successful ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_28:0.0250:and / had a dove, which could only have been
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0065_29:0.0500:written by a poet ; and Walking in Scotland,

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_1:0.0000:72 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_4:0.0250:Owen quotes the Faery song Shed no tear! as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_5:0.0250:worthy of Keats, but we wonder how it was that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_6:0.0250:there are not more better lyrics. Keats, one
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_7:0.0500:would have thought, would have excelled in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_11:0.0500:strict subjection of imagination to one purpose,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_12:0.0500:and this was not a part of Keats' poetic instinct ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_13:0.0000:and though when he came to learn it, he wrote
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_15:0.0500:the best lyrics in the world ; yet it is not im-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_16:0.0000:probable that he would still have regarded lyrics
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0066_18:0.0500:fact remains that, with the exception of La belle
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_1:0.0500:and ill-shapen Elizabethan models to which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_2:0.0500:Keats apparently looked in good faith for guid-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_3:0.0250:ance ; and among which, with their stagey fury,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_4:0.0500:unnecessary confusions, rude manners, and oc-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_5:0.0000:casional magnificences, his play might pass
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_6:0.0250:undistinguished. Unfortunately too this play
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_7:0.0250:turns on a question of maiden virtue, which he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_8:0.0250:could not handle, and which he did not even
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_11:0.0250:across the table to versify or dramatise one by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_12:0.0000:one — a most deadening situation. It is badly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_13:0.0500:contrived : the antecedent conditions are very
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_14:0.0250:elaborate, and yet are never plainly stated ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_15:0.0000:they have to be discovered from isolated, ill-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_16:0.0250:managed and confused hints in the dialogue ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_17:0.0250:so that the attention of an auditor, if it was not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_18:0.0000:entirely put off by this riddle, would only be
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_19:0.0000:kept alive by a wish to come to a judgment of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_20:0.0000:his guesses. The riddle, moreover, has no satis-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_21:0.0500:factory solution. Then the scenes themselves
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_22:0.0500:are rather lacking in distinct dramatic point,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_24:0.0250:But if these faults are not wholly due to Keats,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_25:0.0250:he must yet have the blame of the lack of moral
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_26:0.0250:import, and of the imperfect delineation of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_27:0.0000:characters, whose manners are not good, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_28:0.0250:who seem to take a conscious interest in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0067_29:0.0250:plot. The style has the faults of cold magnifl-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_2:0.0250:sions, with careless grammar, and the use of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_3:0.0250:childish tricks for impromptu effect. In spite
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_4:0.0000:of all this, there is a succinctness and force
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_7:0.0250:and though it is commonly said that he lacked
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_9:0.0250:to refute this, and his determination would have
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_13:0.0500:Otho, already shows an advance. This is written
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_14:0.0250:in a style midway between Marlowe and Shake-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_15:0.0000:speare, and recalls the opening of the third
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0068_18:0.0250:purpose of the characters stand out fairly well
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_0:0.0250:VOCABULARY 75
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_8:0.0500:style. Mr. \V. Arnold* has made a special
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_9:0.0000:examination of these, and his remarks imply
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_10:0.0000:an objection to adjectives with the suffix y>
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_11:0.0250:like bloomy and bowery; but when these are
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_13:0.0500:enough. Adjectives thus formed from other
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_14:0.0000:adjectives — take paly, which should mean full
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_16:0.0000:ing : to any one accustomed to Chaucer's verse
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_17:0.0500:they would sound more like old than new words,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_18:0.0000:and they would be useful in versification, but
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_19:0.0000:they are also like baby-talk, and generally in-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_20:0.0000:defensible ; it does not appear, however, that
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_21:0.0000:Keats laid himself open to any reproach in this
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_22:0.0250:particular. Paly had been used by other writers ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_23:0.0000:and even with these words the test is their
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0069_24:0.0250:success, not their regularity. I never heard of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_12:0.0250:could be substituted : and it has been received
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_14:0.0500:lock" in the Ode to Pan is admirable: on
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_16:0.0250:interpretation : but the general result of Mr.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_17:0.0000:Arnold's examination is that most of the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_18:0.0000:strange words in Keats were taken from earlier
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_19:0.0250:writers. Readers of the poems cannot miss
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_20:0.0250:noting these : they are less likely to observe
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_21:0.0250:the exact nature of the class of epithets which
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_22:0.0500:most frequently recur ; the chief group might,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_24:0.0500:sweet, fair, white, gree?i, old, young, little,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_25:0.0250:and other such words as tender, gentle, easy,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_26:0.0250:fresh, pleasant, most of these suggestive of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0070_27:0.0000:comfort. Then the melting, fai?iti?ig, swim-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_2:0.0500:lone, mysterious, &c, have a great deal to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_5:0.0000:rence of certain objects ; he is as fond of moss
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_6:0.0250:and eagles as Shelley was, and echoes, bees,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_7:0.0250:marble, silver, dew, nests and weeds, — and the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_10:0.0250:tedium of llndyinion may be analysed down to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_11:0.0500:this. The over- frequent use which he makes of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_13:0.0000:teristic of his manner. But he outgrew all this,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_14:0.0250:and if in his early poems he uses these words
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_15:0.0000:too frequently, yet he has also used them as
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_16:0.0000:well as they can be used. Some faults of his pro-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_17:0.0250:nunciation, which have been called p r0 nuncia-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_20:0.0500:is abominable : but this occurs only in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_21:0.0250:early poems. And he renounces in Lamia his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_23:0.0250:used as a disyllable accented on the last,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_24:0.0500:and comes round to the contracted pronun-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_25:0.0500:ciation. This word, and words like fire and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_26:0.0250:lyre, which he makes disyllables, often weaken
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_27:0.0500:his lines ; for in disyllabic metres which admit
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_28:0.0250:elisions and trisyllabic feet, they will not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0071_29:0.0500:readily, at least to my ear, sustain a whole foot
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0073_13:0.0500:and a <hsyllable, in which we now observe both
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0073_14:0.0250:the colliding accents ; and if these words occur
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0073_16:0.0250:their first syllable in the regular stressed place,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0073_19:0.0250:verted. I think that this is not always intended

johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_7:0.0250:see his opposition to the eighteenth-century
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_8:0.0250:writers, who mainly contented themselves with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_9:0.0000:conventional commonplaces for their natural
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_10:0.0000:imagery ; whereas Keats discovers in the most -—
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_11:0.0000:usual objects either beauty or sources of delight
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_12:0.0000:or comfort, or sometimes even of imaginative
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_13:0.0250:horror, which are all new ; and here his origi-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_14:0.0000:nality seems inexhaustible, and his wide poetic
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_15:0.0250:sympathies the strongest. Nor does he confine
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_17:0.0250:much experience ; he makes Nature the object f
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_18:0.0000:of his imaginative faculty — Nature apart from
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_19:0.0500:man, or related to man as an enchantress to a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_20:0.0000:dreamer. This is, I suppose, what he means
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_23:0.0500:he describes what he sees, — I describe what I J-"
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_24:0.0500:imagine. Mine is the hardest task : now see
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_25:0.0250:the immense difference."* Here he shows a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0081_26:0.0500:vast wealth which makes his poems a mine of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_2:0.0500:in his mind in an endless stream to illustrate
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_9:0.0500:sightseer in a gallery overcrowded with pictures,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_15:0.0250:■""■^f passion. The only passion delineated by Keats
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_16:0.0250:is the imaginative love of Nature, and human
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_17:0.0250:love is regarded by him as a part of this, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_18:0.0250:his lover is happy merely because admitted into
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_19:0.0000:communion with new forms of natural beauty.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_20:0.0250:This, which appeared in theory in the explana-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_21:0.0250:tion of the allegory of Endymion (p. 13), is prac-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_22:0.0250:tically exposed in the 2nd stanza of the Ode to
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_24:0.0250:a sensitive mind is recommended to indulge
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_25:0.0250:its melancholy fit, the anger of his mistress is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0082_26:0.0250:enumerated with roses, peonies, and rainbows,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_0:0.0250:PASSION So
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_13:0.0250:have now to add a charge of lack of true in-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_14:0.0250:sight into human passion. If this was wholly
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_15:0.0250:due to the absence of awakening experience,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_16:0.0250:it is at least unfortunate that in Lamia, in
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_17:0.0500:which from its date we might have expected
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_18:0.0250:something mature, he should have chosen so
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_19:0.0000:low a type. Though perhaps suggested by the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_20:0.0000:original of his story, it was not necessary to it ;
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_21:0.0000:and even if he preferred to have his snake-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_22:0.0000:woman bad, there was every reason why Lycius'
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_23:0.0250:passion should have been of a higher type.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0083_24:0.0000:How unworthy it is is shown in the description
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_0:0.0500:90 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_2:0.0500:the end of which is satiety and revulsion, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_5:0.0000:attempt to delineate it, have been satisfied with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_6:0.0500:so vulgar a type. The ideal passion in Isabella
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_7:0.0250:is insipid, and even in The Eve of St. Agnes, the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_8:0.0250:passion, as expressed in stanzas xxxv.-xxxix., is at
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_9:0.0000:best of a conventional type, and has to have a
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_10:0.0000:good deal read into it by the light of the story.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_11:0.0500:But Keats' dnrjrinf; nf hpantyj which might
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_13:0.0500:never is by him, may often be reconciled with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_16:0.0250:trations have been given (see pp. 18-19), I shall
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0084_18:0.0250:imagery probably always followed, if it did not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_2:0.0250:and they must be interpreted in the light of his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_3:0.0250:high idea of philosophy. Keats was conscious,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_8:0.0250:for philosophy. Were I calculated for the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_9:0.0000:former, I should be glad ; but as I am not, I
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_14:0.0250:than an utterance of that contrarious mood
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_16:0.0500:evidence that Keats was unlikely to have de-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_17:0.0000:preciated the intellectual element of his art :
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_18:0.0250:but the intellectual element is always in league
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_19:0.0500:with emotion, and would have been, I imagine,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0085_21:0.0500:out such mixture. In the Epistle to Reynolds,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_0:0.0500:92 JOHN KEATS
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_2:0.0500:beauty in introducing it under this enhanced
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_6:0.0500:uttering his reiterated impatience for more
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_10:0.0500:consummation in the Revision of Hyfterio?i,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_11:0.0500:where it seems as if he had imagined himself
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_19:0.0250:than between these on the one hand and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_20:0.0250:his practical human qualities, as revealed by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_22:0.0500:was an unbroken and unflagging earnestness,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_24:0.0250:servant of itself as to be almost unmatched.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_26:0.0250:and ill, in the spontaneous and felt quality of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0086_28:0.0500:even ; it would sometimes seem, of consideration
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_0:0.0250:LACK OF HUMOUR 93
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_1:0.0250:failure in his purely comic freaks I do not know,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_3:0.0000:humour, for which, in spite of some Lack of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_4:0.0500:traces in his letters, it does not ap- humour.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_5:0.0250:pear to have left any room. The best of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_7:0.0250:a few are quite foolish, and a great number
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_11:0.0500:and relaxing his own mind. The chief charm
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_13:0.0250:is nothing between the pen and the mind, not
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_15:0.0500:should be worth reading : it is enough that it is
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_22:0.0500:showed so little severity towards himself in the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0087_23:0.0250:castigation of his poems, though that was, as I
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_6:0.0500:temperament, unselfish and devoted to his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_14:0.0000:deal influenced by other poets, and had an
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_15:0.0000:unequalled power of reproducing not only the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_16:0.0000:style of any writer whom he imitated, but the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_17:0.0250:mental attitude which informed the style,* so
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_18:0.0250:that one is tempted to venture a bull of him,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_20:0.0000:he would have been only a plagiarist. But
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_21:0.0250:it was not until he came to rival Milton's epic
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_22:0.0500:that his originality seemed to be fn danger ;"
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_24:0.0250:by its likeness to Paradise Lost. If the two
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0088_26:0.0500:is plain that Keats does not reach the sustained
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0089_1:0.0250:sonority and force of Milton (nor has he even
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0089_2:0.0000:shown as much skill in characterising his
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0089_3:0.0250:divinities, whose elemental personalities would
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0089_21:0.0250:may break off abruptly. I began it with a due
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0089_22:0.0000:sense, as I thought, of responsibility, and with
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0090_19:0.0000:terms, a manner which I prefer, because by
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0090_20:0.0250:obliging the writer to say definitely what he
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0090_22:0.0250:and in this way the true business of criticism
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0090_23:0.0000:may be advanced ; nor do I know that, in work
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_3:0.0500:to be copied. Keats has had some such
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_13:0.0500:R. B.
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_17:0.0000:as April 1819, finally discarding it in September 1819,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_18:0.0000:is, I tli ink, probable ; but I do not wish it to be taken
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_19:0.0000:for more than an opinion. It seems possible that the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_20:0.0000:poem may have been begun as long as two months
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_21:0.0000:earlier, and as much of it as there is may, in that case,
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_22:0.0000:have been done by January. This does not affect the
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_23:0.0000:Bc q OBttCB of his work ; but a careless interpretation of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_24:0.0500:rence to Hyperion in the letter to Bailey of
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_25:0.0500:August 18 19 would entirely mislead. I have not at-
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_26:0.0250:tempted to settle doubtful details of chronology, and
johnkeatscritica00briduoft_0091_27:0.0000:do not wish to appear to have done so. This question
