angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0017_15:1.0000:Our Prince, thus welcome we !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_3:1.0000:Musing I stood at eventide ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_4:1.0000:Before me rolled in silver sheen
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_5:1.0000:Her waters, sportive in their pride, —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_6:1.0000:Laughing and dancing merrily,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_7:1.0000:Resistless in their boisterous glee.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_8:1.0000:From the cerulean arch of sky
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_9:0.9750:Gleamed thousand sparkling jets of light ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_10:1.0000:The crescent moon now rose on high,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_11:1.0000:Like eastern bride half- veiled from sight !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_12:1.0000:While Zephyr breathed his am'rous tale
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_13:1.0000:To plain and forest, hill and dale.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_14:1.0000:Now oped the flowers their odour cells.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_15:1.0000:And Nature smiled beneath the light ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_16:1.0000:Now Fancy wrought her magic spells,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_17:1.0000:"Waked by a scene so fair and bright.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_18:1.0000:A scene so bright, it seemed to me.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0020_19:1.0000:To hold the soul of Poesy !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_1:1.0000:Entranced I heard the waters roar,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_2:1.0000:Entranced beheld the billows play ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_3:1.0000:Ceaseless they kissed the loving shore,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_4:1.0000:Ceaseless they came and stole away.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_5:1.0000:They came and went unchecked and free,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_6:1.0000:Revelling in love and liberty !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_7:0.9500:I caught their spirit, caught their mirth, —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_8:1.0000:Yes, caught their wildest mirth and spirit !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_9:0.9750:And dreamt the while, I stood on earth
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_10:1.0000:Which only freemen must inherit !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_11:1.0000:Freemen, said I ? Where — Where are they ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_12:1.0000:This land obeys a foreign sway !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_13:1.0000:And yet, where'er I turn my eyes.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_14:1.0000:In this fair land by Nature blest.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_15:1.0000:Visions of vanished light arise.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_16:1.0000:And cheer and swell the sinking breast.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_17:1.0000:Each scene — each spot that meets the sight,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_18:1.0000:Is redolent of mem'ries bright !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_19:1.0000:The mountain pass ; th' extended plain ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_20:1.0000:The snowy peak ; the valley green ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_21:1.0000:The sylvan bower ; the sacred fane, —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_22:1.0000:Glitt'ring with glory's magic sheen ; —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_23:1.0000:Recall the days of freedom, when
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0021_24:1.0000:Our fathers lived and died as men.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_2:0.9750:Where are thy former virtues fled ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_3:1.0000:Where now thy ancient chivalry, —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_4:1.0000:The spirit of thy mighty dead ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_5:0.9500:Urjoona, Yishma, Lukshman's dart,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_6:1.0000:The spirit of their lion-heart ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_7:0.9750:Is yonder grovelling, dastard slave
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_8:1.0000:Who sees, unmoved, famed field and flood.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_9:1.0000:Descended from the gallant brave ; —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_10:1.0000:Swell his veins with heroic blood ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_11:1.0000:Alas ! to foreign steel and thrall
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_12:1.0000:Is due his own, his country's fall !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_13:1.0000:Yet still, 'tis sweet on thee to gaze.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_14:1.0000:To linger on thy rifled charms ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_15:1.0000:To dwell, with thrilling soul, on days
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_16:1.0000:When thou wert great in arts and arms.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_17:1.0000:Each wound that makes thee bleed and smart,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_18:1.0000:To thee but closer draws my heart !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_19:1.0000:But, hark ! what sound assails the ear,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_20:1.0000:Like to the ocean's mighty roar ?
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_21:0.9750:The Prince is come ! and loud and clear
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_22:1.0000:India's sons greet him to her shore !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_23:1.0000:And now I hear two voices sing
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0022_24:0.9750:Their welcome to her future King.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_2:0.9500:'*Hail, noble Prince ! to India's coral strand,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_5:1.0000:This fallen land hath risen once again !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_8:0.9500:O'er this fair realm then hung a dismal gloom.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_9:1.0000:More awful than the darkness of the tomb ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_10:1.0000:Then fled the Arts by fierce oppression driven,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_16:0.9750:Scared bv the tyrant's yells, and mis'ry's cries,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_17:0.9750:Didst wing thy flight to more congenial skies !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_18:0.9750:"Not hall, nor bower, nor the shady grove
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_19:0.9750:Resounded then the thrilling strains of love :
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_20:1.0000:A dreary winter reigned o'er all the land,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0023_21:1.0000:Locking the springs of joy in icy band !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_1:0.9500:* Go thou, old Ocean's Bride, go wear yon gem.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_2:1.0000:Yon gHtt'ring jewel in thy diadem ! '
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_3:1.0000:Inspired with noble aim and purpose high.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_4:1.0000:The Queen of th' azure deep came sweeping by.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_5:0.9750:At her approach dissolves the gloom away,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_6:1.0000:The sun of Knowledge bursts and cheers the day ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_7:0.9750:The Arts spring up beneath her witching tread,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_8:1.0000:And o'er the varied scene their blessings shed ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_9:1.0000:The Lightning-spirit bears her words afar,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_10:0.9500:And Giant Steam propels her iron car ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_11:1.0000:Pair cities rise where hamlets stood before.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0024_14:0.9750:Shall pass the sceptre of this classic land !

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0025_11:1.0000:But thou gleamest. Prince, upon our eyes.

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0026_13:1.0000:Thus rang the voices in mine ear
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0026_14:1.0000:With a majestic choral swell ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0026_15:1.0000:And shouts of gladness I could hear
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0026_16:1.0000:Ascend from plain, and hill, and dell.

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0027_7:1.0000:Thy reign has cast a ray, — a gleam
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0027_8:1.0000:Of hope, where all was dark despair ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0027_9:1.0000:Dispel not, oh ! the pleasing dream

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0030_15:0.9500:There are showers of flowers ; and bannerets flutter,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0030_17:0.9750:As India receives her heart's desire.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0030_19:0.9750:His advent to greet'
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0030_20:0.9750:As he steps on shore
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0030_22:0.9750:Of myriad thunders of fort and fleet !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0031_3:0.9500:A dream of triumph, a vision grand, —
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0031_6:0.9750:Was never dreamt or seen ;
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0031_7:1.0000:Strange as some new-bom mystic star,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0031_12:1.0000:Smiling with genial sheen ;

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0124_17:0.9500:You pass by a jasmine, a lily, a rose.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0124_19:1.0000:A subtle, etherial scent ! She is there !
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0124_20:1.0000:The sweet Flower Fairy, ineffably fair!

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_8:0.9750:From lands of the snow, and from lands of the sun,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_9:0.9750:From lonely isles of Pacific seas.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_10:1.0000:From the blue Azores, or the Cyclades,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_19:0.9750:Her Royal Speech is breathed, if not heard.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_20:1.0000:For some waft of perfume forms every word.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_21:1.0000:The moon smiles down on the palms above.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_22:1.0000:The orient nightingale warbles for love,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0125_25:1.0000:The firefly lights up his lamp in the trees,

angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_15:1.0000:And o'er moor and down, and mountain brown,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_16:0.9500:Was heard the soft echo " Under the Ceown ! "
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_17:1.0000:And the moon grew pale, and the stars grew white,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_18:0.9750:And sadly the firefly quenched his light.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_19:1.0000:And the wind moaned softly, and flowers bent low.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_20:1.0000:And from leaves of the myrtle dew-tears did flow,
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_21:1.0000:As Tangerina, with all her suite.
angloindianpriz00thomgoog_0128_22:0.9750:Darted away on airy feet

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_7:1.0000:died out afar its beautiful expanse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_8:0.9500:Luring the voyager, by the charming scene,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_11:0.9500:No cloud of threat 'n ing in the distant sky ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_12:0.9750:AVhcn, unencumbered with the toils of life,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_13:0.9750:Its whirl of business, and incessant strife,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_14:0.9500:The hours sped on, with grateful leisure fraught,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_15:1.0000:AVith scope for fancy and untraimneled thought;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_16:1.0000:loin to stroll through Academus' shades,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_17:0.9500:To con the classics, and t< woo the maids ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_18:0.9750:Kach winged pleasure in its flight to seize,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_19:0.9750:And idly wanton in the lap of ease ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0023_20:1.0000:Ah, then, my muse ! in many a rhythmic line,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_1:0.9750:In many a sonnet, fashioned by thine aid,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_2:0.9500:Some new Dulcinea saw her charms portrayed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_4:1.0000:My listening chum applauded with a zest ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_5:1.0000:To many a crude conception of the brain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_6:1.0000:Provoking mirthful, or satiric strain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_7:1.0000:Reserved from Fancy's evanescent throng
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_8:1.0000:Thou gav'st a being, and a garb, in song.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_9:0.9500:Remorseless years ! amid whose length'ning train,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_10:1.0000:O'er the broad waste of time's extended plain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_11:1.0000:Close on your footsteps, in a concourse vast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_12:0.9500:Stalk the weird spectres of the fading Past ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_13:1.0000:Mark ye, how yonder, in despairing gloom,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_14:0.9750:What splendid hopes have found their early tomb !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_15:0.9500:See in those forms, with cypress wreaths entwined,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_16:1.0000:What tearful mem'ries ye have left behind !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_17:1.0000:See, fallen prostrate with insensate clods,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_19:1.0000:See brave resolves, begot in pomp and state,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_20:1.0000:Consigned in silence to an early fate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_21:1.0000:See grand beginnings vanish into air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_22:1.0000:The things that were, and not the things that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_24:0.9750:See even Genius veil its sacred fire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0024_25:1.0000:Its flame, uncherished, suffered to expire ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_3:0.9750:See many a wild, yet beautiful idea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_4:0.9750:Too transcendental for 'our mundane sphere,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_5:1.0000:Nipped at its budding, in a soul intent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_6:0.9750:On notions coupled with their ten per cent. !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_10:1.0000:We enslave the thought, and dedicate the years !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_12:1.0000:Our first is bartered for our second self.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_13:1.0000:Unlike, dissentient, when we join the two,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_14:1.0000:Our life entire is monstrous to the view.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_15:0.9750:No graceful outline, no symmetric whole
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_16:1.0000:Attests the hcalt : -; of the soul.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_17:1.0000:No pleasing fitness of the parts combined,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_18:1.0000:Shows the true culture of tli' immortal mind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_19:1.0000:So oft we note, in our maturer y
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_21:0.9750:We cheat our nature of its first estate;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_22:0.9750:Some powers we fetter ; some wo stimulate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_23:0.9750:stes we stifle, which the soul prefers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0025_24:0.9500:To please our clients, or our customers.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_1:1.0000:While some lone talent, singled out, perchance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_2:1.0000:The veriest creature of a circumstance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_3:1.0000:We task and torture to our being's end,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_4:1.0000:Because, forsooth, it yields a dividend !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_5:1.0000:Not so, the great, eternal Source of mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_6:1.0000:Its education and its growth designed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_7:1.0000:To use not one, but all His gifts to man,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_8:1.0000:Is to fulfill the wise creative plan.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_9:1.0000:No vain appendage no superfluous taste,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_10:1.0000:No talent given for neglect or waste,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_11:1.0000:Came from His hand, who graciously imbued
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_12:1.0000:Man with His essence, and pronounced him good.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_13:0.9750:The dearest homage which the soul can show
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_14:1.0000:To its great Author, is, itself to know.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_15:1.0000:Itself to cherish and develop here,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_16:1.0000:As ripening only for a higher sphere.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_17:1.0000:As but rehearsing on the stage of time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_18:1.0000:For that grand Drama awful and sublime
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_19:0.9500:When the vast Drop-scene shall be rolled away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_22:0.9750:And the Forever shall be ushered in !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_23:1.0000:The sure philosophy of life to learn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0026_24:1.0000:And then to practice, is our chief concern.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_1:1.0000:The wisest, happiest method to pursue ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_3:1.0000:Not all alike, in power, and skill, and grace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_5:0.9500:Some, life's abstruser mysteries may sound,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_6:1.0000:And tread the caverns of the deep profound ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_7:1.0000:Others, on Fancy's airy wing may fly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_8:1.0000:To scenes unwitnessed by the vulgar eye.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_9:1.0000:Some, 'neath the lordly portals of the brain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_10:1.0000:Their royal visitants may entertain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_11:1.0000:Guests, that from far ideal realms have come,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_12:1.0000:To find with mortals a congenial home.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_13:1.0000:Not all, alike, in goodly shape, and fair,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_15:1.0000:Profuse with decoration fitly wrought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_16:1.0000:To wait th' indwelling of the new-born thought ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_17:0.9750:Yet 'tis no partial Hand that first outpours
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_18:1.0000:Upon our race these intellectual stores ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_19:1.0000:Nor hath thy fellow reason to avow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_20:1.0000:Himself mo-re blest, more fortunate, than thou.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_21:1.0000:Each, in his own unique, peculiar plan,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_22:1.0000:Hath the beginnings of a perfect man.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_23:1.0000:Nay, e'en the basest brother of our kind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_24:1.0000:In the recesses of his dormant mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_25:1.0000:Some germs all undeveloped may behold,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0027_26:0.9500:Which might have reproduced an hundred fold.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_2:1.0000:"Who fail'st a glorious mission to fulfill.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_6:1.0000:By paltry pebbles on the barren shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_7:1.0000:But lift thy gaze, O mortal ! to descry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_8:1.0000:The boundless ocean and the starry sky.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_10:0.9750:Conform what is, to that which is to be ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_11:1.0000:So, when thy brief apprenticeship shall end,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_14:1.0000:Its lofty towers upreared against the skies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_15:1.0000:Till, master-builder, lastly thou shalt come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_16:0.9500:To crown thy life-work with its lordly dome !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_17:0.9500:In the great reck'ning at the final day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_18:1.0000:When the recording angel shall display
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_19:1.0000:The grand sum-total ; and our life appears
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_20:0.9750:By thoughts computed not by length of years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_21:0.9750:That life the truest and the best may seem,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_22:1.0000:Which mortals scoffed at, as an idle dream.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0028_26:0.9750:Souls of the thrifty, and the worldly-wise !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_2:1.0000:Which leads him onward to his long abode,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_3:0.9750:Who, while he fails not duly to bestow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_4:0.9500:A just attention to affairs below,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_5:1.0000:Regards these only at their real worth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_6:1.0000:Nor barters heaven for a patch of earth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_7:1.0000:Who ne'er forgets, amid his round of toil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_8:1.0000:How unsubstantial is this mortal coil.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_9:0.9750:With ready will, to earn his bread attends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_10:1.0000:But ne'er confounds life's means with life's great ends.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_11:1.0000:Who deems it not man's paramount pursuit
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_12:1.0000:To build a factory, or to make a boot ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_13:1.0000:Nor thinks his duty hath been wholly done,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_14:1.0000:Who leaves a fortune to his darling son.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_15:1.0000:Who loves to search within his storied mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_16:1.0000:Some sparkling jewel of a thought to find.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_17:1.0000:AVho keeps some inner chamber of the heart

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_21:0.9750:Who glads the ear with music, and the eye
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_22:1.0000:With forms of beauty loves to gratify.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_23:1.0000:Who walks with sages that have gone before,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_24:0.9750:And treads a measure with the bards of yore.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_25:1.0000:Who loves at times in cheerful way to spend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0029_26:0.9750:A social evening with a pleasant friend.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_1:1.0000:Who prizes books, and sedulously heeds

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_10:1.0000:And glides from manhood to serene old age.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_11:0.9750:In fine, who lives a life of generous aim ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_15:0.9500:So, at the harvest- time, himself to yield
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_16:1.0000:A sheaf, well ripened, in the Master's field.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_17:1.0000:I know, the world, time-servient, disagrees
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_18:1.0000:"With vain ideas and heresies like these ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_19:1.0000:I know full well what sages will dissent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_20:1.0000:From such a strain of idle sentiment ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_21:1.0000:I know the proverbs of the worldly-wise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_22:0.9500:What plans of thought and action they advise ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_24:0.9500:Within whose limits they exhort to move ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_25:1.0000:But I believe, the two extremes between,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0030_26:1.0000:Our better sense may find the golden mean.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_2:1.0000:Which quite absorbs us in its one idea ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_3:1.0000:And while, with like disfavor, we disown
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_4:1.0000:The jack-at-all-trades, or the lazy drone ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_5:1.0000:A liberal course our steps may still pursue,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_6:1.0000:To human kind, and human nature, true.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_7:1.0000:Poor slave of Mammon ! though thy sordid brain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_9:0.9500:Within thy bosom thou may'st yet behold
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_10:1.0000:A wealth more precious than thy heaps of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_12:1.0000:A gem so brilliant, it can far outshine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_13:1.0000:The choicest product of Golconda's mine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_14:1.0000:A vital spark from the celestial flame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_15:1.0000:Which now and ever must exist the same.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_16:0.9750:It is thy soul ; to slavish bondage doomed-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_18:0.9500:See with what layers of avarice and of guilt,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_19:0.9750:Thine own dark sepulchre thyself hast built !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_20:1.0000:See how thy purer hopes and joys have fled
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_21:1.0000:To habitations of the early dead !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_22:0.9750:See life's sweet graces, its emotions kind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_23:1.0000:The holy tics that love and friendship bind ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_24:1.0000:Th' inspiring glories of creation, all
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0031_25:1.0000:Shut out and banished from thy prison wall !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_2:1.0000:Before the windows of thy buried soul !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_3:1.0000:One opening still admits its ghostly light,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_4:1.0000:To show the ruin, to appal the sight ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_5:1.0000:Ah ! 'tis thy faithful memory ! would' st thou gaze
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_12:1.0000:Its golden moments, pure and unalloyed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_13:0.9750:In guileless thoughts and gentle deeds employed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_19:0.9750:And beck'ning onward, waves her shining wings.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_20:1.0000:Well might thy vision seek to linger there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_21:1.0000:Amid a scene so bright, so passing fair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_22:1.0000:Fain wouldst thou deem the picture all complete,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_23:1.0000:No mortal life could hail a dawn more sweet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_24:0.9500:But look ! how soon the swelling stream runs high,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0032_25:0.9750:The storm-king threatens in the angry sky ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_1:1.0000:The troubled waves their cheerless banks divide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_2:1.0000:While the sad Hours stand up on either side,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_3:1.0000:To tell the number of thy past misdeeds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_4:1.0000:Like hooded friars, counting o'er their beads !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_5:0.9750:Could we unlock their chambers, and disclose
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_6:1.0000:In human hearts, their multitude of woes ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_7:0.9750:Could we but half the agonies reveal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_9:0.9750:Our souls would own the picture strangely true,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_10:1.0000:The faithful Muse would offer to the view.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_11:1.0000:Alas ! how many a wreck in human mould,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_12:1.0000:Consumed with passion or the lust of gold,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_13:0.9750:Lives only to pervert creative plan,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_14:0.9750:And dies, the shameful counterfeit of man !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_15:0.9750:Our educations, and the vicious rules,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_16:0.9750:Which so obtain in Fashion's latest schools ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_17:1.0000:The standards of our modern exceDence,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_18:1.0000:Tin- praise accorded unto base pretence ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_19:0.9500:The sycophantic homage often shown
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_20:0.9500:Toward foppish idiots for the wealth they own ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_21:0.9750:The estimate of man by what is his ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_22:1.0000:V>\ what he has, and not by what ho is ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0033_23:0.9750:That " aristocracy," which seeks to find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_3:0.9500:That eager thirst for gold, which scruples not
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_4:0.9750:At means unworthy, so it may be got ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_8:0.9500:And dwarf the nobler impulses of mind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_10:0.9500:And thwart the expectations of the soul.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_11:0.9750:Yet he who rashly ventures to assail
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_12:1.0000:The social wrongs and vices which prevail,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_13:1.0000:Is deemed a mad fanatic, or a fool,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_16:1.0000:On him who seeks its follies to expose ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_17:0.9750:And that enthusiast, who with ardor warm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_18:0.9750:Plants, in his dreams, the standard of reform ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_19:0.9750:Who fondly thinks to part the clouds away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_20:1.0000:And hail the dawn of the millennial da}-,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_21:0.9750:May well take heed, lest he erelong shall be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_22:0.9500:At Mammon's shrine, himself a votary.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_23:1.0000:For so the world, with its mysterious charms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_24:1.0000:Our earlier impulse and intent disarms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0034_25:0.9500:That he who first with brave assurance vows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_1:0.9500:Or, less combative, hopes to keep aloof,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_2:1.0000:And shun the rabble 'neath a quiet roof,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_3:0.9750:Little by little, yields him to the tide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_4:1.0000:And downward floats, the motley crew beside.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_7:0.9500:So fares the world ; so, none of Adam's seed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_8:1.0000:No rank, profession, school, position, creed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_9:0.9750:Escapes from Mammon's avaricious clutch,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_10:0.9750:Or shuns his all-contaminating touch.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_11:0.9500:Thus, in one scale, untrue, but still obeyed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_12:0.9500:Actions and motives everywhere are weighed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_14:0.9750:Man's Jaily conduct is discus ed and tried.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_19:0.9750:And counts her empire a peculiar boast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_20:0.9750:There Mammon holds his most distinguished court,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_21:0.9500:Where willing subjects faithfully resort.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_22:1.0000:There, abject mortals, servient 'neath his nod,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_23:1.0000:Acknowledge him their ruler and their god.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0035_24:0.9500:There, too, he finds, to guard his regal state,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_1:0.9750:As some rich rogue, his knaveries to hide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_2:1.0000:Keeps able counsel ever at his side,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_3:0.9750:Retained, their skill and eloquence to lend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_4:0.9750:Their client's fame and fortune to defend ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_9:1.0000:A host of minions who can chant his praise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_10:1.0000:Extol his glories, magnify his fame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_11:1.0000:And fling the cloak of custom o'er his shame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_12:1.0000:And so the Press, whose once united tone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_15:0.9750:The world might rescue from its moral blight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_16:1.0000:Perverts its power ; and busily repeats
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_17:1.0000:The idle talk and jabber of the streets.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_18:1.0000:Panders to passion, and to morbid taste ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_19:1.0000:Observes the current, and with eager haste
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_20:1.0000:Adopts the tenets of the winning side,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_21:0.9750:And floats conspicuous with the rushing tide.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_22:1.0000:Confined by ties of party, or of sect,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_23:1.0000:The general weal it cares not to effect ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_24:1.0000:Of demagogues and knaves the pliant tool,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0036_25:1.0000:And selfish interest its guiding rule,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_2:1.0000:And make the paper, or the volume, sell.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_5:0.9750:Its doctrine moulds to suit the hearers' views,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_6:0.9750:And, like a mirror, must reflect the pews.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_8:0.9500:"Where thought from time should hold its brief di-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_10:0.9750:Whither approaching, with a reverent awe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_11:0.9750:To hear God's word, and learn his sacred law,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_12:0.9750:The world's concerns and cares should ne'er intrude,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_13:0.9500:But hearts should flow with love and gratitude ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_14:1.0000:Where all should meet high, humble, rich and poor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_15:1.0000:And leave their false distinctions at the door ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_16:1.0000:As worms, alike predestined, and for whom
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_17:0.9750:The same great Leveler opens wide the tomb ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_22:1.0000:Here Fashion's votaries, in a vast array,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_23:1.0000:Convene to hold their weekly gala-day ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0037_24:1.0000:And while the sinners for forgiveness sue,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_3:1.0000:In each department of our social state,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_4:0.9750:He stamps his impress with a crushing weight ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_5:0.9750:And leads his subjects passively along,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_6:1.0000:A blinded duped, infatuated throng !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_7:0.9750:Ah 1 when will mortals from their follies turn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_8:0.9750:The simple theory of life to learn ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_9:1.0000:With faithful vision see and own a truth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_10:1.0000:Which nature shows us in our early youth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_11:0.9500:Regard life only for its nobler ends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_12:0.9750:And live as brothers, and as generous friends ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_15:1.0000:My hope is slender but I can conceive
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_16:0.9750:How man his social errors might retrieve ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_17:0.9750:Pursue a course by selfish care unvexed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_18:1.0000:And so spend this life as t' insure the next.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_19:1.0000:I can conceive a social state, wherein
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_21:0.9500:Insane excitements, mutual distrusts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_22:0.9750:Unholy passions and unbridled lusts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_23:1.0000:Might all be banished from our midst away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0038_24:1.0000:And Reason hold her kind and gentle sway.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_4:1.0000:Around us, and beneath, and overhead !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_5:0.9500:Mark how, as myriad eyes, whose glance is love,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_6:0.9500:The stars smile down upon us from above ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_8:0.9750:As through the startled ether soars the sun ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_12:1.0000:In hill, and vale, and lake, and waterfall ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_13:1.0000:In fountain, river, rill and ocean wave ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_14:1.0000:In mountain-dome, and hoary cliiY and eave ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_15:1.0000:In tree and shrub, in foliage and in flower ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_16:1.0000:In shady grove, and in sequestered bower ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_17:1.0000:In rolling prairies, and in grassy glades,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_18:0.9500:AVhat wondrous beauty everything pervades!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_19:1.0000:Then see, responsive to a moderate toil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_20:1.0000:How Plenty leaps out from the teeming soil !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_21:1.0000:How Earth from out her rich, exhaustless stores,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_22:1.0000:Yields up her minerals and her shining ores ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_23:1.0000:Her varied products, neither sparse nor few,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_24:1.0000:Enough for comfort and for luxury too.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0039_26:1.0000:Of all her children, 'neath her generous sun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_14:0.9500:Which turned to shape in Earth, and gave control
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_15:0.9750:To Man, as lord and ruler of the whole.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_16:1.0000:A strange perversion, which, increasing through
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_17:1.0000:The lapse of ages since the world was new^
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_18:1.0000:Hath come to make of this our social life,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_19:0.9500:A scene of jealous and discordant strife ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_20:1.0000:To make our race to false restraints conform,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_21:1.0000:And one worm lord it o'er his fellow-worm.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_22:1.0000:This man, to-day, exults in pride and power,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_23:1.0000:Pet child of fate, and hero of the hour.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0040_24:1.0000:With cool disdain he treats the humble poor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_2:1.0000:Loves to dispense alternate weal and woe.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_3:1.0000:Another generation turns the scale ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_4:1.0000:The poor grow rich ; the wealthy bankers fail ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_5:0.9750:And they, whose fathers, only yesterday,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_6:1.0000:With golden sceptre held a potent sway,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_7:1.0000:Now in their turn pursue the walks of toil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_8:0.9750:While beggars' offspring occupy the soil.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_9:1.0000:Our life's a see-saw, marked with ups and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_11:0.9750:A curious mixture, both of smiles and frowns ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_12:0.9750:A treacherous sea, whose surface, calm to-day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_13:0.9500:Yawns wide to-morrow to engulph its prey.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_14:1.0000:And yet, strange man! unschooled through all the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_16:0.9750:Along whose course life's vanity appears,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_17:1.0000:The will-o'-wisp of fortune still pursues,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_18:1.0000:The self same chase persistently renews.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_19:0.9750:Lives, not to gather that substantial good,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_20:0.9750:Which shall go with him o'er the Stygian flood ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_22:1.0000:Beyond the empire and the waste of time :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_23:1.0000:Not that ripe soul, which, rising o'er the sod,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_24:1.0000:In full perfection shall ascend to God ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_25:1.0000:But such mere baubles as the hour affords,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0041_26:0.9750:With tireless zeal and industry, ho hoards ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_2:0.9750:And so toils on, till that last enterprise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_3:0.9750:Of getting buried, claims the shrinking thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_4:0.9500:And one word tells his simple record " Nought !"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_5:0.9750:If half the hours we toil were set apart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_6:1.0000:For generous culture of the mind and heart ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_7:0.9500:If, while sojourning on time's transient shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_8:1.0000:We trifled less, and thought and felt the more ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_9:0.9750:If all united with an equal zeal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_10:1.0000:In temporal duties for the common weal ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_11:0.9750:And not as now, one labored to excess,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_12:1.0000:While his rich brother lolled in idleness ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_13:1.0000:If all reserved, from daily cares aside,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_14:1.0000:An ample leisure, wisely occupied ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_15:0.9500:The world, methinks, would still move on apace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_16:0.9750:And healthier progress would attend the race.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_17:0.9750:Our art, and science, and inventive skill ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_18:0.9750:The loom, the sledge, the plow-share and the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_20:1.0000:The calls of industry on land and main,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_21:0.9750:Would still invoke their patrons not in vain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_24:0.9750:In the rare studies which so well impart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0042_25:1.0000:The choicest graces to the human heart ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_1:0.9750:In the sweet social pleasures, kindly given
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_2:1.0000:As earthly foretastes of the joys of Heaven.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_3:1.0000:A life more real, earnest, manly, free,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_4:0.9750:This life ideal we should find to be.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_5:1.0000:Peace, like a river, through our midst would
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_7:0.9750:And earth become a paradise below.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_8:1.0000:The same great Power that ovemdeth all ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_9:1.0000:Fashions the orbs, and notes the sparrow's fall;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_10:0.9500:That bids us for the morrow take no thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_11:0.9750:But seize the boon the present hour hath brought ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_12:0.9750:For man's necessities would still dispense
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_13:1.0000:The boundless favors of Omnipotence.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_14:1.0000:And if, perchance, each temporal estate
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_15:1.0000:Should yield its increase at a slower rate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_16:1.0000:If unto each, with competence content,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_17:1.0000:His capital should yi< Id a loss per cent ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_18:1.0000:B and continent should greet our eyes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_19:1.0000:"With fewer fruits of worldly enterprise :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_20:0.9500:Yet if, instead, to bless the human race,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_21:1.0000:More thought, more love, and charity had place ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_22:0.9750:If all within this mighty brotherhood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_23:0.9500:Preferred the lasting to the transient good ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0043_24:0.9750:Such would be wisdom's part ; and we might

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_2:1.0000:Better than rubies, or than shining gold.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_3:1.0000:There is who hath, and yet so poor is he,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_4:1.0000:No words can show his depth of poverty.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_5:0.9750:There is a solid wealth, which hath no end,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_7:0.9750:pend ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_8:1.0000:And whose possessor, though a peasant's son,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_9:0.9500:Consorts with nobles, and himself is one.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_10:1.0000:Give mo this wealth, and though in humble
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_12:1.0000:I keep my calling while I sojourn here ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_13:1.0000:Yet not the gold of Ophir, nor the gems
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_14:1.0000:From India's cave, nor royal diadems
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_15:1.0000:Can buy the passport I shall bear with me,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_16:1.0000:To earth's and heaven's " best society."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_17:1.0000:There is a sweet refreshment in the thought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_18:1.0000:Of dignity too precious to be bought.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_19:1.0000:There is a badge of manhood, whoso owns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_22:0.9750:And bear complacently the sneers of fools.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_23:0.9750:The man w r ho entertains within his breast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_25:1.0000:Accounts no honor paramount to that :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0044_26:0.9750:He is your only true aristocrat.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_2:0.9750:His bath the sea, his walk the ocean strand ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_3:1.0000:The forests and the rivers he shall own ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_4:0.9750:The mountain summit is his lofty throne ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_5:1.0000:He shall possess, where, in their little day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_6:0.9750:Others as tenants, and as boarders, stay.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_7:0.9750:He shall be lord of land, and sea, and air ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_8:0.9500:Where e'er snow falls, or water flows, or where
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_12:0.9500:Or sown with stars, or terrible with storms ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_13:0.9750:Where e'er are outlets into space above ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_14:0.9500:Where e'er is danger, wonder, awe, or love ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_15:0.9500:There sheddeth beauty, plenteous as the rain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_16:0.9750:For him, proud monarch of the vast domain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_19:1.0000:He shall discover in each proffered boon,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_20:1.0000:Nothing ignoble, or inopportune.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0045_21:1.0000:Cease now, my muse, thy unaccustomed strain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0046_2:0.9500:These list'ning friends have treasured as they heard ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0046_4:0.9500:Which finds an answering echo in each breast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_2:0.9500:THERE'S music in the winds :

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_4:1.0000:Or sweep tempestuous across the seas,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_5:1.0000:Or waft sweet perfumes in tho evening breeze ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_6:0.9750:There's music in the winds.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_7:1.0000:There's music in the streams :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_8:1.0000:That break their waters down the craggy steep,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_9:1.0000:Or o'er the shining pebbles gaily leap,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_10:1.0000:Or seaward roll, in channels broad and deep ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_11:1.0000:There's music in the streams.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_12:1.0000:There's music in tho fields :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_13:0.9500:Tho verdant meads that stretch across the plain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_14:1.0000:Tho sloping hill-side, orchard, pasture, lane,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_15:0.9500:Tho crops of yellow corn and waving grain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_16:1.0000:There's music in the fields.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_17:1.0000:There's music in the woods :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_18:1.0000:The wildernesses where the fleet hind roves,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_19:1.0000:Tho sighing pine-cliffs and tho vocal groves,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_20:1.0000:Where bird-choirs hymn their praises, plaints, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0047_22:0.9500:There's music in the woods.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_1:1.0000:There's music in the sea :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_2:1.0000:The diapason of old Ocean's roar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_3:1.0000:Whose wild waves in perpetual encore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_5:1.0000:There's music in the sea.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_6:1.0000:There's music in the storms :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_7:1.0000:That run their courses over heaven's highway,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_8:0.9500:And turn the day to night the night to day ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_10:0.9750:There's music in the storms.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_11:1.0000:There's music in the stars :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_12:1.0000:That fair Astarte's queenly robes adorn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_13:1.0000:That sang together at creation's morn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_14:0.9500:When, at Jehovah's mandate, Earth was born ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_15:0.9750:There's music in the stars.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_16:1.0000:There's music through the whole
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_19:0.9500:But sweetest of all music far, is LOVE :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0048_20:0.9750:The music of the soul !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_5:1.0000:THE sun is falling in the west ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_6:1.0000:His last beams cut the billow's crest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_7:1.0000:Snow-white with the glistening foam ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_8:1.0000:For the choicest waters are filtered up
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_9:1.0000:To the rolling brim of old Neptune's cup,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_10:1.0000:As the sea-bird's welcome home ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_11:1.0000:And the Fleet- Wing's sails are gaily drest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_12:1.0000:With the rainbow tints, so fondly prest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_13:1.0000:On the gracefully swelling dome.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_14:1.0000:The grand old clouds drawn closely round,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_15:1.0000:Present the Day-king, enthroned and crowned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_16:1.0000:In his fullest glory dying ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_17:1.0000:And to travel that beautiful silver road
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_18:1.0000:To the golden gate of my Lord's abode,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_19:0.9750:The spirit is sorrowfully sighing !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_21:0.9750:The sun is set ; his work is done ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_22:1.0000:And the timid moon has just begun
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_23:1.0000:To cast her shadows, thin and pale,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_24:1.0000:As I take my watch on the gallant deck,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_25:1.0000:To descry the distant loom or speck,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0049_26:0.9500:That betokens land or sail.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_2:1.0000:With its angry stroke sways the mizzen-mast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_3:1.0000:Every timber crackles sharp ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_4:1.0000:And hark ! on the quivering shroud and stay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_6:0.9750:In mournful numbers, and numbers gay;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_7:1.0000:list to the sailor's harp !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_10:1.0000:I mark with what grief ! how awfully fraught
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_11:1.0000:Was the simplest word and deed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_12:1.0000:Ay, the crisis acts of my life are known
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_13:0.9750:From the lowliest impulse and hope to have grown-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_14:0.9750:In a heedless hour was widely strown
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_15:1.0000:The poisonous, blasting seed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_16:1.0000:But no ! this night I will banish care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_17:1.0000:The heavens above are transcendently fair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_18:1.0000:My soul, like the orbs that are glittering there
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_19:0.9750:Above the troublous waves,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_20:1.0000:That once and now against me beat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_21:1.0000:Shall rise, and gaze, but only greet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_22:1.0000:The pleasant sea, the temperate sheet ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_23:1.0000:Alone the forms and faces meet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_24:1.0000:Which in old times did seem so sweet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0050_25:1.0000:That now I scarcely dare repeat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_4:1.0000:And halting memory's rapid pace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_5:0.9750:I linger round each cherished place ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_6:1.0000:I kiss each bending, tearful face ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_7:0.9500:Low, soothing, deep-breathed peace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_8:1.0000:I mind me of the gladsome child
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_9:0.9750:On whom a tender mother smiled ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_15:1.0000:What I have been, but let mo seem!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_16:0.9750:At the first fountains of Time's stream,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_18:0.9750:Of Innocency, let me lie ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_19:1.0000:Like a half-drowned wretch I rise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_20:0.9750:And far beyond the gathering skies,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_21:0.9500:A cruel fiend returns my cries ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0051_23:0.9500:I gasp with downcast, tearful eyes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_1:1.0000:I never more shall dare contrast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_2:1.0000:The present woe with the lovely past.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_3:1.0000:My doom is sealed ; the die is cast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_4:1.0000:I cannot differ from the last.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_5:0.9750:For hark ! Hear the heavy death-bells toll !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0052_7:0.9500:In a long dark line to the Judgment goal !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_2:0.9500:LADY, 'twas on this day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_3:1.0000:As old traditions say,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_4:0.9750:That Love was born.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_5:1.0000:It was a gladsome birth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_6:1.0000:Fit cause for joy and mirth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_7:1.0000:Among the sons of Earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_8:0.9750:A race forlorn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_9:0.9750:On this, his natal day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_11:1.0000:His pastime takes.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_12:1.0000:The cause of Love ho fights ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_13:1.0000:Fond hearts in bliss unites ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_14:1.0000:The torch of Hymen lights ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_15:1.0000:Its flame awakes.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_16:0.9500:His well-directed dart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_17:0.9750:Has pierced mo ; and my heart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_18:0.9500:Beats tremulous.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_19:0.9500:O, Lady, may thine own
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_20:1.0000:Beat in sweet unison,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0053_21:0.9750:And Love's pure flame alone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_2:1.0000:I WISH that I could say to you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_3:1.0000:The words that would convey to you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_4:0.9500:The measure of my love ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_5:1.0000:But language isn't strong enough,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_6:1.0000:Nor are our meetings long enough,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_7:1.0000:Nor are there strains of song enough
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_8:1.0000:Its height and depth to prove.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_11:1.0000:To utter all I feel ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_12:1.0000:And I am conscious all the while,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_13:1.0000:As we the charming hours beguile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_14:1.0000:How somewhat doubtingly you smile
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_15:1.0000:At what I can't reveal.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_16:0.9750:O, I am sure, that if you knew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_17:0.9750:And read my inmost feelings through,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_18:0.9750:You could but yield return
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_19:1.0000:Of love for love ; which, come what will,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_20:1.0000:Through all the future can but thrill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0054_21:1.0000:This heart ; and on its altars still,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_2:1.0000:WHAT long ago I might have read
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_3:1.0000:Had fortified myself to know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_4:1.0000:So long the waiting deadened dread,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_5:1.0000:And friendship's hopes began to grow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_6:1.0000:But yesternight, while conning o'er
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_7:1.0000:A journal from the dear old place,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_8:1.0000:I saw what I had skipped before
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_9:1.0000:The grieving tidings, face to face !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_10:1.0000:I'd held the paper as a screen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_11:1.0000:Against the blazing on the hearth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_12:1.0000:But when I sa\v what was between
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_13:1.0000:Two aged deaths and one small birth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_14:1.0000:My hands dropped with a nerveless grasp ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_15:0.9750:I stared into the very flame ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_16:1.0000:Then wonder if my crimson cheeks
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_17:1.0000:Were scorched with fire or flushed with shame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_18:0.9750:Th< desert winds blow in a moan !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_19:1.0000:The good flag's halliards whip the staff ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_20:0.9500:The one the music of a groan,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0055_21:1.0000:And one, the mocking of a laugh.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_2:1.0000:Suggestive, tantalizing chants ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_3:1.0000:In pauses we may introvert,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_4:0.9750:And spring a strength from Nature's taunts.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_5:1.0000:Out of a sadness may we bring
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_6:1.0000:A nameless sweetness, which belongs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_7:1.0000:To olden times, and takes the sting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_8:1.0000:From sighs and semblances of wrongs.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_9:1.0000:Though much has passed to leave regret,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_10:1.0000:Some cherished memories remain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0056_11:1.0000:The woe I brave or can forget :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_2:1.0000:Ox her brow, clouds of anger were blended,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_3:1.0000:While sorrow sat heavy on mine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_4:1.0000:In a mad moment I had offended,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_5:0.9750:And she bade me depart from her shrine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_6:1.0000:A shrino I so fondly had knelt at,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_7:1.0000:And decked with my darlingest flowers ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_8:1.0000:A shrine I in rupture hud dwelt at,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_9:1.0000:In my life's most enrapturing hours.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_10:1.0000:And so I go forth, sad and lonely,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_11:1.0000:Tormenting regret in my soul ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_12:1.0000:Sweet fruit turned to ashes ; and only
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_13:1.0000:A wretchedness passing control.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_14:1.0000:And so all rny path seems o'ershaded,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_15:1.0000:And the saddest of lessons I learn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_16:0.9750:And I mourn with a conscience upbraided,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_17:1.0000:t joys that may never return.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_18:0.9500:One hope I shall timidly cherish ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_19:1.0000:It is in her bosom to find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_20:1.0000:A heart, which, though love itself perish,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_21:1.0000:Can never be other than kind :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_22:1.0000:A heart so forgiving and tender,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0057_23:1.0000:No hate can endure there long while.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_6:0.9750:This day, from which we date
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_7:1.0000:Our Nation's birth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_9:1.0000:For freedom took their stand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_10:0.9750:And made Columbia's land
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_13:1.0000:With equal favors blest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_14:0.9500:Sing freedom's song ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_16:0.9750:Cast all their strife away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_17:0.9750:And, joined in glad array,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_20:1.0000:That seek to hurl the brands
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_22:0.9500:Still let our rallying cry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0058_23:1.0000:Of " Union " rise on high,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_2:0.9500:Shall catch the sound.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_3:0.9750:God ! 'neath whose watchful eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_4:1.0000:All things in earth and sky
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_5:1.0000:. Fulfill their end ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_6:0.9500:Guide Thou our Ship of State
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_7:1.0000:Secure through Peril's strait ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_8:1.0000:Still grant propitious fate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_9:0.9500:And still defend !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_10:1.0000:So shall its towering form,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_11:1.0000:Unscathed through wind and storm
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_12:1.0000:Bide on its way ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_13:1.0000:Our favored land shall be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_14:1.0000:The home of liberty ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0059_15:0.9750:Her sons shall worship Thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_3:0.9500:So lavish of smiles, and so charming to view ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_10:1.0000:And the sunshine of love be o'erclouded with
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_12:0.9500:I weep as I think that the heart I so prize
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_13:1.0000:Is reserved for some other, more favored, more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_14:0.9750:blest;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_15:0.9750:That some other shall bask in the light of those
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_16:0.9500:eyes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_17:0.9750:Of those heavenly smiles for a lifetime possessed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0060_21:0.9500:And the pure vows I fain would present at thy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_3:1.0000:Thus to steal one's heart, I say !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_4:1.0000:'Tis a treasure quite too rare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_5:1.0000:To be wrested thus away.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_10:1.0000:I'll expose myself no more.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_11:1.0000:Or, if you should think it best,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_12:1.0000:In return to give me thine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_13:1.0000:So we'll let the matter rest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_14:1.0000:I'll take yours, and you keep mine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_15:1.0000:Or, (I'm not disposed to falter,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_16:1.0000:Since this mischief is begun.)
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0062_17:1.0000:Drawing near to Hymen's altar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_10:1.0000:Press on, nor let action, nor struggle be quelled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_11:0.9500:While Error and Vice are seen stalking abroad.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_12:0.9500:High stations of honor are waiting us now ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_15:0.9500:And anon, shall adorn each victorious brow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_16:0.9750:The evergreen wreath, decked with Fame's fairest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0063_21:0.9500:Of the patriot sire, and the patriot son.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0064_6:0.9500:In the triumph of right be the victory won !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_3:1.0000:How LONG have ye cherished for Erin, in vain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_4:1.0000:The hope to behold her a nation again ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_5:1.0000:How long on her neck is the Britisher's heel ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_6:0.9500:How long has his mocking returned her appeal ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_7:0.9750:Lo ! now is the day-spring, ye pris'ners of Hope !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_10:0.9500:For the vows of our land with this promise are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_11:0.9750:thrilled :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_18:0.9750:Were the boys who court-martialed the son of a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_20:0.9750:And on the first field that our soldiers contest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0065_21:1.0000:Undisciplined, though of the bravest and best
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0066_7:0.9500:Up the cloud-circled mountain resistlessly hurled !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0066_13:0.9500:turned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0066_18:0.9750:Oh, no! Speed the time when the Briton must
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0066_19:1.0000:yield
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0067_1:0.9500:And when from our Navy each ocean shall be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0067_2:0.9500:To the commerce of England a bottomless sea :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_2:0.9500:Now pr'ythee, dear Nell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_3:1.0000:Don't affect sucli a swell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_4:1.0000:Nor take on in such terrible fashion :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_5:1.0000:I've told you before,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_6:1.0000:That it vexes me sore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_7:1.0000:When I see a sweet face in a passion.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_8:1.0000:I think it's too bad,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_9:1.0000:You should go and get mad,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_10:1.0000:And that, too, in despite of my coaxing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_11:0.9500:I really supposed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_12:1.0000:When at first you disclosed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_13:1.0000:So much anger, you only were hoaxing.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_14:1.0000:But be this as it may :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_15:1.0000:If it be as you say
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_16:1.0000:And I certainly hav'n't a doubt of it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_17:1.0000:I mean to hold fast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_18:0.9750:To the fun that is past,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_19:1.0000:And I know that you can't cheat me out of it.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_20:1.0000:Until life's sun is set,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_21:1.0000:I shall never forget
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0068_22:0.9500:How with love we were, both of us, dying :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_1:1.0000:How I vowed to be true,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_2:1.0000:And, sweet rogue, so did you,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_3:1.0000:And we knew all the time each was ! ! !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_5:1.0000:Do not squander a sigh,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_6:1.0000:Nor in sad melancholy grow thinner :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_7:1.0000:For how shameful 'twould be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_8:1.0000:If you did so for me,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_9:1.0000:Such a vile, irreclaimable sinner !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_10:0.9750:Now, don't fling away
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_11:1.0000:A poor " minstrel's last lay,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_12:1.0000:But remember to what cause you owe it ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_13:0.9750:But for this fuss alone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_14:1.0000:You might never have known
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0069_15:1.0000:That your " dearest of friends " was a poet.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_2:1.0000:THE blighted flower, the rustling leaf,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_3:1.0000:The mournful winds that round us sigh,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_5:1.0000:That summer's past, and winter nigh.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_6:1.0000:The King of Day, so bright erewhile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_7:1.0000:From his high station looking down,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_8:1.0000:Seems hardly to vouchsafe a smile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_9:1.0000:But sends aslant a sullen frown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_10:1.0000:To kindlier climes the timid bird
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_11:1.0000:Hies with his fond and gentle mate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_12:1.0000:No longer is their warbling heard,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_13:1.0000:But all is drear and desolate !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_14:1.0000:So dies the year ! its death how sad !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_15:1.0000:But 'tis not sadness of despair ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_16:1.0000:For spring again the earth shall glad,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_17:1.0000:Nature her robes of green shall wear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_19:0.9750:While time speeds on with restless wing ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_20:1.0000:Our souls shall hail a brighter day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0070_21:1.0000:And flourish in eternal spring.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_3:0.9750:Who lives not lacking all ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_4:1.0000:Who sends his faithful memory searching back,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_5:1.0000:And ferrets out a hope that he may call
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_7:1.0000:A yearning with a trust,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_8:1.0000:Chaste, dignified, high set,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_9:0.9750:Else 'twere no hope, but lust.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_10:1.0000:We never have our true desires ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_11:1.0000:We hardly search aright ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_12:0.9750:Too soon appreciative sense expires ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_13:1.0000:The circumstance is tardier than the right.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_14:1.0000:We have no answers, but in darkness grope.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0071_15:0.9500:Life may be, should be, but a single hope ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_4:1.0000:O'er my spirit softly stealing, like a magic-woven
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_6:0.9500:'Tis a feeling half of gladness, tho' 'tis deeply tinged
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_8:0.9750:With a melancholy sadness, as I speak the word
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_9:0.9750:" farewell,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_10:0.9750:And thy voice is heard to echo back the thrilling
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_11:0.9500:word " farewell ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_12:0.9500:Thy remembrance I shall treasure with a sentiment
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_15:0.9500:shall end ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_16:1.0000:For, embalmed in recollection, there will be the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_17:0.9500:sweet reflection,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0072_22:0.9750:Fare thee well ! tho' fate may sever, friendship's flame
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0073_5:1.0000:All harmoniously blending, thou art welcomed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0073_7:0.9500:And thou hast thy home forever aye, forever in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_3:0.9500:LAST eve, as I strayed, to my wondering view
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_4:0.9750:A fairy appeared, as at times fairies do :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_5:0.9500:From some bright world afar, to this dark one of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_7:0.9500:She had trippingly come, with a handful of flowers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_9:0.9500:All speaking one language the language of love;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_10:0.9750:And while I stood rapt, such a vision to see,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_11:0.9500:She blushingly smiled, and she gave them to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_19:0.9500:And the whole in a bunch with blue ribbon were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_21:0.9750:And I thought, as I gazed on their beauties com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_22:0.9500:bined,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0074_23:1.0000:Such beauty, world over, I hardly could find.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_2:1.0000:The bright looks of her, so much fairer than they
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_3:1.0000:The beautiful giver ; beneath whose sweet smile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_4:0.9500:No wonder the flowers bloomed so richly the while.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_5:0.9750:Ah ! well may my sullen, but sensible muse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_6:1.0000:To attempt such a task of description refuse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_7:1.0000:For grace so transcendent, the muse must confess,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_9:0.9750:But while memory lasts, and I ponder them o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0075_13:1.0000:These flowers I would cherish, must droop and de-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_20:0.9750:One was a cur of famed combative strain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_21:1.0000:The English bull, with terrier intermixed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0076_23:0.9500:Tail brief, eyes red, protruding under-jaw,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_2:0.9750:Of canine conflict, view with favoring eyes.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_3:1.0000:A butcher owned him, and he strode the earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_4:1.0000:Like one that deemed the better part his own.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_5:1.0000:The other was a shaggy, homely brute,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_6:1.0000:With coat unkemped, and drooping tail and ears,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_7:1.0000:And aspect mild, and deprecating mien.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_8:1.0000:His restless eye, and gaunt, ungainly shape,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_9:1.0000:Told that he lived neglected, and had earned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_10:1.0000:By toilsome march for many a month gone by,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_11:0.9750:A bare subsistence of unwholesome food
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_12:1.0000:Through desperate forays into kitchen yards,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_13:0.9750:And feats of reckless plunder everywhere.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_14:1.0000:He chanced, in passing by the butcher's stall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_15:1.0000:To cast upon the fat and savory joints
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_16:1.0000:A look of longing, yet with no intent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_17:1.0000:Of open seizure, or of felony.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_18:1.0000:Tis true, his hollow stomach tempted sore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_19:1.0000:The little virtue left by pinching want ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_20:1.0000:Still he resisted, and with measured trot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_21:0.9750:W.ts journeying onward, when the butcher's cur
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_22:1.0000:Insolent with plenty, and with angry jaws
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_23:1.0000:Still red with recent revels, upward sprang,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_24:0.9750:And after the retreating stranger sent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_25:0.9750:A growl of scorn. The latter stopped and turned
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0077_26:0.9500:The jeer and insult grated to the quick ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_1:1.0000:And with the fire of noble fathers dead
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_2:0.9500:And turned to sausage, and with bristling back,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_3:0.9750:He boldly faced the scorner of the poor.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_4:1.0000:No word was uttered ; each the other eyed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_5:1.0000:And showed his teeth with sanguinary growl,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_6:1.0000:Hurling defiance and undying hate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_7:1.0000:And courting combat in its direst form.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_8:1.0000:Around they walked, stiff-legged and menacing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_9:1.0000:In circle, to survey the Vantage ground ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_10:1.0000:Then with a howl of pent-up, smothered rage,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_11:0.9750:They sprang together, and the silent street
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_12:0.9750:Eoared with the tumult of the struggling dogs.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_13:0.9750:The fur flew. Then a score or less of curs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0078_14:1.0000:Mingled their voices with the general din.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_4:0.9750:And far above, the glittering sheen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_5:0.9500:Of Heaven's bright orbs would come and go.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_6:0.9750:I felt old Boreas' stinging bite,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_7:1.0000:As shrieking through the sash he came,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_8:1.0000:And saucily addressed my light,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_9:1.0000:As if she were an olden flame.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_12:0.9750:And rushing up the narrow road,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_13:1.0000:Whirled fiercely round the traveler's head,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_15:1.0000:Was quite unable well to shift,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_16:1.0000:While striving Buncombe's speech to call,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_17:1.0000:He could not, somehow, see the drift.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_18:1.0000:Ha ! how the laughing stars, so mild,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_19:1.0000:Watch the mad frolic from on high ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_20:1.0000:They seem to say : A favorite child
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0084_21:1.0000:Is privileged to tease and cry.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_1:0.9750:I dropt the curtain on the scene,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_2:0.9750:And back within my chamber turned ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_7:1.0000:The sweetest breeze, the harshest blast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_8:1.0000:The day to sing, the night to weep.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_9:1.0000:Allotted by the mighty King
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_10:1.0000:All pass before my shrinking eye ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_11:1.0000:Nor first the sorrows bear a sting,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_12:1.0000:While every joy upheaves a sigh.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_13:1.0000:As hooded monk and mail-clad knight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_14:1.0000:Upon their patron's natal eve,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_15:1.0000:With gorgeous pomp and solemn rite

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_21:1.0000:The vestal, silver lamps that shine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0085_22:1.0000:Depended from the casements high ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_1:0.9750:Nor is there movement in the line,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_2:1.0000:Until they flicker, leap and die ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_3:1.0000:So, from the portal of my mind

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_5:0.9500:Innumerable host, that wind
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_6:1.0000:Beneath the gateway-torches' glare.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_7:0.9750:The arsenal of thoughts and deeds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_8:1.0000:At last forsaken all apart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_9:1.0000:Each nature on the other feeds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_10:0.9750:Heart looks on mind, mind searches heart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_12:1.0000:Some cursed menial yet remains ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0086_13:1.0000:I see her 'mid the light nay hark !

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_1:0.9750:Why did I fail the form and voice
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_2:1.0000:Of childhood's innocence and peace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_3:1.0000:To recognize ? But now rejoice !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_4:1.0000:Hope argues from them, doubtings cease.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_5:1.0000:Blest Heaven, we see, that ere the soul
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_6:0.9750:Is quite divorced from Faith and Truth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_7:0.9750:Before remembrances are whole,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_8:1.0000:An angel trims the lamp of youth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_9:1.0000:With cruel throbbing pulsed my head,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_10:1.0000:My brain with thousand vagaries teemed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_11:1.0000:As, worn and weary, on my bed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_12:1.0000:I threw my panting self and dreamed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_13:1.0000:Amid my native hills I roam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_14:0.9750:I hear the brooks, I taste the breeze ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_15:1.0000:Disposed at once to joy and gloom,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_16:1.0000:I mark each scene of childhood's glees.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_17:1.0000:Mysterious presence by my side !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_18:1.0000:And stranger still in that I know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_19:1.0000:It is my love, and joy, and pride,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_20:1.0000:That close attends where'er I go.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_21:0.9750:Full recognition with the morn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_22:1.0000:My longing, anxious spirit had ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0087_23:0.9500:'Twas then I knew that face and form
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0088_6:0.9500:button-hole ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0088_12:0.9500:and far,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0088_13:0.9750:The lawyers, and a host beside who practice at the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_2:0.9500:of the law
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_7:0.9750:smile from her ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_8:0.9750:Come on at least with ready will, and only do your
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_10:0.9750:And I your most admiring friend will answer for
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_22:0.9500:you to fulfill ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0089_23:0.9750:But harder yet to shake them off, unless you say
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_2:0.9500:worse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_3:1.0000:An honest toast, though plainly clad in unambitious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_4:0.9500:verse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_5:1.0000:Forget the garb that clothes the thought, uncomely

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_7:1.0000:But to the naked sentiment, drink heartily with
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0090_11:0.9750:Proud owners of this fair estate their fathers battled

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_2:0.9750:Hath she no charms and graces to display ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_4:0.9500:May she not seek some market for herself ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_5:0.9750:In sooth she may ; nor let one cynic dare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_6:0.9500:To chide this feature of our Berkshire Fair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_9:0.9750:Come on, fair matrons, and ye laughing girls,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_10:0.9500:With raven tresses or with auburn curls ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_11:0.9750:Come one, come all to ply those nameless arts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_12:1.0000:Which make such havoc with our tender hearts.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_13:0.9750:Who knows how many an unrecorded prize
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_15:0.9750:How many a swain beholds but to adore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_16:1.0000:Some favorite lass he almost loved before !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_17:0.9750:Ah ! who can tell, from such a scene as this,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_22:0.9750:Health to the daughters of our worthy dames !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_23:1.0000:The brightest jewels which old Berkshire claims.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_24:1.0000:Despising not the duties of their sphere,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0093_25:1.0000:Behold the trophies of their labor here !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0094_3:0.9500:The laces, silks, and works of finer art ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_2:1.0000:ANOTHER festal day's return :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_3:1.0000:Thrice uttered be the greeting,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_4:1.0000:As round those lights that brightest burn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_5:1.0000:The Brotherhood are meeting.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_6:0.9750:No anniversary of Time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_7:1.0000:Our Order's records centre
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_8:1.0000:When first she ope'd her gates sublime
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_9:1.0000:And bade the pilgrim enter.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_10:0.9500:Who have not passed by Mount Moriah,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_11:1.0000:Nor learned the sealed Ionic,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_12:0.9750:May deem the widow's son of Tyre
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_13:1.0000:Possessed no word Masonic.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_14:0.9750:But let rejected skeptics cry,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_15:1.0000:Her ancient dates are fiction ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_16:1.0000:Few will presume to her deny
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_18:1.0000:And, lo ! the bond in Art confessed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_19:1.0000:When skilled with square and gavel,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_20:0.9500:Through Europe's courts, from East to West
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0095_21:1.0000:The Masters freely travel.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_2:0.9750:Those wonderful adapters,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_3:1.0000:Who crowned the simple Doric shaft
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_5:1.0000:When he, whose architecture wove
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_6:1.0000:In stone the hymn and psalter,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_7:0.9750:Upreared the Pantheon far above
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_8:0.9500:St. Peter's gorgeous altar ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_9:1.0000:When rectitude of heavenly law,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_10:1.0000:Once symboled by the plummet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_11:1.0000:Was typified to heights of awe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_12:0.9750:In Strasbourg's piercing summit ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_13:1.0000:Or when Milan's cathedral choirs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_14:1.0000:First sang the strains of Starble
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_15:1.0000:As burst into a spray of spires
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_16:1.0000:That soaring wave of marble.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_17:1.0000:Albeit the operative tools
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_18:1.0000:Of true Masonic labor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_19:1.0000:Now yield the Order's nobler rules,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_20:1.0000:Toward God, and self, and neighbor.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_21:0.9750:We bring not from the distant Past
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_22:0.9750:A legendary story
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_23:1.0000:The grandest living structures cast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0096_24:0.9500:Her monumental glory.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_2:1.0000:Who by the TEMPLE'S building,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_3:1.0000:By every joined block and beam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_4:1.0000:By splendid wealth of gilding,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_5:1.0000:By column and by vestibule,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_6:1.0000:And by the place vail-hidden,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_7:1.0000:Presented "Wisdom's perfect school,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_8:1.0000:To which our lives are bidden.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_9:0.9750:No more the Pantheistic thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_10:1.0000:Life is a plant's expansion :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_12:0.9750:In texture of a mansion.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_13:0.9750:The pavement of .a ground-floor shows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_14:1.0000:A handiwork indented ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_15:0.9750:The walls which faithfulness enclose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_16:1.0000:By justice are cemented.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_17:0.9500:O, bond of Truth ! O, mystic tie !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_18:1.0000:That binds our heart-strings human,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_19:1.0000:In brotherhood that passeth by
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_20:1.0000:The vaunted love of woman !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_21:0.9750:Where, in the wide world's mighty scope,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0097_22:1.0000:Are found the homes not wanting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0098_1:0.9500:The Ark whose capitals we greet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0098_2:1.0000:Which holds the workmen's wages
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0098_5:1.0000:So shall it move, majestic, grand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0098_6:1.0000:Through Time's prescribed cycle,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0098_7:1.0000:'Till on the sea and on the land
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_4:1.0000:I SAW them at the window,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_5:0.9500:So like the Graces Three ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_6:1.0000:The loveliest and fairest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_7:1.0000:The eye could wish to see ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_8:1.0000:And from those merry voices,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_11:1.0000:Came floating to my ear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_12:1.0000:There stood the charming Annie,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_13:1.0000:I always loved so well ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_14:1.0000:And Lou, for whom my fondness
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_15:1.0000:I hardly dare to tell ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_16:1.0000:And lastly, tho' not leastly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_17:1.0000:Of aU the Merry Three,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_19:1.0000:Oh what a witch is she !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_20:1.0000:And so I just bethought me,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_21:1.0000:All bashfulness aside ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_22:1.0000:To send this bunch of sweetness,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0099_23:0.9750:(My love solidified /)
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0100_2:1.0000:And always think of me,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0100_3:1.0000:When you recall the Christmas
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_4:0.9750:As WEARY traveler, panting for repose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_5:1.0000:Halts on liis journey, where some streamlet flows ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_6:0.9750:Seeks out some grassy couch beneath the trees,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_7:1.0000:And shuts his eyes, and calmly takes his ease ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_8:1.0000:So comes our Goddess, with a gladsome mien,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_9:1.0000:Lured by the aspect of this joyous scene.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_10:1.0000:Sated with glory and the deafening noise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_11:0.9750:Of crackers, guns, and patriotic boys ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_12:1.0000:Crazed with the medley both of sounds and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_15:1.0000:The very music all at once she scorns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_16:1.0000:Intoxicated with so many horns ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_17:1.0000:Weary of these, wo bid her welcome here,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_18:1.0000:This nice old lady, in her eightieth year.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_19:1.0000:Hearty, and halo, and fair she is, as when
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_20:1.0000:Her earliest presence cheered the soul-tried men.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_21:1.0000:Her waist grows ampler, and her arms, 'tis true,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_22:0.9750:Have kept on stretching all her lifetime through.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0101_23:0.9500:For many a year, perplexed with want and toil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_1:0.9500:In fair proportions her estate has grown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_2:1.0000:By thrift and tact she more than holds her own.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_3:0.9750:Her buxom form, for aught that now appears,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_4:1.0000:Bids fair to last another four-score years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_5:1.0000:For well she knows, whatever may befall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_6:0.9500:Her CONSTITUTION can survive it all.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_9:1.0000:Recount the strange adventures of her youth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_10:1.0000:A tale of romance, but of treasured truth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_11:1.0000:How she and Jonathan conspired to wed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_13:0.9500:How, ever since the nuptial knot was tied,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_14:1.0000:Flocks, acres, children, all have multiplied.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_15:1.0000:How, from the thirteen patrimonial farms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_20:1.0000:How, vexed and jealous at the rare success,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_21:0.9500:Britannia sought her daughter to distress ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_22:0.9500:How Johnny Taurus came from o'er the sea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0102_23:0.9750:To put in force the tax upon his tea ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_4:1.0000:In later times, how, on a foreign field,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_6:0.9500:How, from the first, through each successive year,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_7:1.0000:On land, on sea, in every noble sphere,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_8:0.9750:In science, arts, and legislative skill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_9:0.9500:With sword and plow-share, and the gray goose-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_11:1.0000:With wind and water, earth, and fire, and steam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_12:1.0000:And lightning harnessed like a docile team ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_13:0.9750:In every branch of commerce and of trade,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_14:0.9500:Where man's proud impress ever yet was made ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_17:0.9500:All this at length, the Muse would fain rehearse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_18:1.0000:In faithful numbers and befitting verse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0103_19:1.0000:But, closely scanning the assembled throng,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_1:1.0000:From hill and dale, from north and south, from east
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_3:0.9750:Sound praises and thanksgivings for the patriot men
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_7:0.9500:She gazes at her rich domain, extending far and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_9:0.9750:Her noble lakes, her busy streams, her prairies and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_11:0.9500:While from them all, in unison, ascend the glad ho-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0104_17:0.9750:That midway o'er so fair expanse, should stretch
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0105_7:0.9500:Not a shadow there lingers of doubt or of care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0105_15:0.9500:As old time rushes on with his clattering car ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0105_16:0.9500:But no absence or distance can wither or chill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0105_23:0.9500:From old ocean to ocean her praise shall bo sung.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0106_5:0.9500:slaves.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_3:1.0000:MY boyhood home is fresh to view ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_4:1.0000:The gladdening spring has dressed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_5:1.0000:The landscape with her foliage new,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_6:1.0000:And all the earth seems blest.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_7:1.0000:The fine old street once more is paved
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_8:1.0000:With shadows from the elms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_9:0.9750:Whose branches have for centuries waved
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_10:1.0000:In clear, ethereal realms ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_11:1.0000:And interclasped their wrinkled hands,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_12:0.9750:With bridal verdure clothed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_13:1.0000:As though in earth they heard their bans ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_15:1.0000:The hills and mountains are replete
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_16:1.0000:With glory as they stand :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_17:1.0000:The one, soft sloping to our feet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_18:0.9750:The other sharp and grand.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_19:1.0000:And close below the rugged steep,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_20:1.0000:The Housatonic flows ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_21:0.9750:Lake moat before a fortress keep,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0107_22:0.9500:Defiant to its foes.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_1:1.0000:And dotting all the valley plain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_2:1.0000:Are mansions of the proud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_3:1.0000:Who leave the city's strife for gain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_4:0.9750:In summer's sultry cloud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_5:0.9750:In quiet haunts like these to find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_6:1.0000:From care a sweet release,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_7:1.0000:And gather for a burdened mind
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_8:1.0000:The recompense of Peace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_9:0.9500:This day above an hundred, seems
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_10:1.0000:Enriched by Nature's rule ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_11:1.0000:The sun is temperate in his beams ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_12:1.0000:The winds are low and cool.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_13:1.0000:Now, while the morning hours remain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_14:1.0000:I'll seek some favorite place,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_15:1.0000:Where I can wake an olden strain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_16:0.9750:Some childhood lines retrace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_17:1.0000:And first my thoughts are westward turned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_18:0.9750:Beyond the pine-clad hill.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_19:0.9750:Alas ! I'm told the grove is burned ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_20:0.9750:In ruin lies the mill.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_21:1.0000:The woods destroyed, the marble bed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_22:1.0000:Untouched by workmen, save
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_23:1.0000:When at a summons from the dead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0108_24:0.9750:To decorate a grave.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_1:1.0000:So that to click of bar or spade
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_2:0.9750:Within our burying grounds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_3:1.0000:The muffled drill alone is made
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_4:1.0000:To give responsive sounds.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_5:0.9750:That ravished and deserted spot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_6:1.0000:I cannot wish to see ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_7:1.0000:For what it was, and now is not,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_8:1.0000:Would mournful speak to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_9:1.0000:Across the river, 'neath a spring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_10:1.0000:Near to the mountain's crest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_11:1.0000:A rock of reddish hue juts forth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_12:1.0000:As from a mother's breast.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_13:0.9750:Nor treble labor of ascent,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_14:1.0000:Nor lack of picture grace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_15:0.9750:From yonder rock, do now prevent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_16:1.0000:My visit to its base.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_17:0.9500:But I remember, vivid, when
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_18:0.9750:I last stood there at dawn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_19:1.0000:With one I shall not see again
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_20:1.0000:For George has long since gone.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_21:0.9750:Two names upon the southern side,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_22:1.0000:Were rudely carved by him ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_23:0.9750:But, I am told, before he died,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0109_24:0.9750:The marks had grown quite dim.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_1:0.9750:O, friend, beloved ! No sculptured stone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_2:1.0000:Affords my heart relief ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_3:1.0000:I see in that rough rock alone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_4:0.9750:My monument of grief.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_5:0.9750:Forgive me, then, if I refuse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_6:1.0000:To walk where oft with thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_7:1.0000:Those paths in pleasure others choose
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_8:1.0000:They're sacred now to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_9:0.9750:Then what direction shall I take,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_10:1.0000:Where I in ease may look ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_11:1.0000:Will memories jarring discord make
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_12:0.9750:Along the Roaring Brook ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_13:1.0000:Would any thing of recent change
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_14:1.0000:Unpleasant feelings bring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_15:1.0000:Should I decide to visit now
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_17:0.9750:The morning hours are fully passed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_18:1.0000:The sun rolls down his zenith wave ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_19:1.0000:As with a fancy, pleased at last,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_20:1.0000:I turn my steps toward Belcher's Cave.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_21:1.0000:A hard and patient search revealed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_22:1.0000:The cavern's mouth to me again ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_23:1.0000:For nature cunningly concealed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0110_24:1.0000:The entrance to the forger's den.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_2:0.9500:Would lead us creeping through the porch ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_3:1.0000:Then suddenly illume the nave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_4:1.0000:With flashes from his birchen torch.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_5:1.0000:And when we boys would, proud, declare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_6:0.9500:Dave's cool contempt for snakes and ghouls ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_7:0.9750:Droll Tom would say : " He's oft been there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_8:1.0000:In search of Belcher's forging tools."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_9:1.0000:Ah, me ! when on far distant shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_10:1.0000:I stood beside each lowly grave ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_11:1.0000:I did not think I should once more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_13:1.0000:Here history and tradition both
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_14:1.0000:Rehearse of charities and crimes ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_16:1.0000:The other, tales of grandame's times.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_17:1.0000:A lad who sought his father's ewe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_18:0.9750:One day, descried a curious smoke ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_19:1.0000:The bank soon up the chimney flew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_20:1.0000:And this illegal broker broke.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_21:1.0000:What days were " celebrated " here !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_22:0.9750:Here there were scenes of wildest mirth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_23:1.0000:The grandest frolics of the year
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0111_24:0.9750:Were held around this spacious hearth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_2:0.9750:Not the cold thinking of the mind mature ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_3:0.9750:With harsh demands of duty these are born ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_4:1.0000:The former only in our hearts endure.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_5:1.0000:Awake, ye echoes of the joyous past 1
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_6:1.0000:I summon now a happy youthful throng.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_7:1.0000:Come all, as when we here assembled last,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_8:0.9500:With jest, and trick, and anecdote, and song.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_10:0.9750:By turns provoking me to laugh and weep j
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_12:0.9750:And gladly (wearied) I recline and sleep.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_13:0.9750:And as I slept, Lo ! I was in a trance ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_14:0.9750:A fairy troop surround my flinty bed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_15:0.9500:With pantomimic gesturing they dance ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_17:1.0000:Again the fairy waved her golden wand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0112_19:0.9750:Madonna-like, her look was sweet and fond ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_2:0.9750:Her chastened beauty warmed upon my heart ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_5:0.9750:Again the sceptre waves ! The spell is broke ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_6:1.0000:The dear illusion can no longer please :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_7:1.0000:For O ! how full of agony I woke,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_8:1.0000:And found that I was weeping on my knees !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_9:0.9750:An impulse, irresistible and strange,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_10:0.9500:Prompts me to climb the craggy ledge above ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_12:0.9750:And learn the meaning of the dream of love.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_13:1.0000:Through the thick covering of the village trees,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_14:0.9750:A pleasant cottage meets my roaming eye ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_15:0.9500:Instant, as though borne to me on the breeze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0113_16:0.9750:Sweet thrills of recognition force a sigh !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_3:1.0000:Endowed with charms and graces rare ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_4:0.9750:"With lustrous eyes, whose glance is rapture,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_5:0.9750:And beautiful masses of golden hair.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_6:1.0000:A rich bloom, like the summer rose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_7:1.0000:Upon her soft cheek courts repose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_8:1.0000:And o'er her features, when she smileth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_9:0.9750:A gleam as of sunlight comes and goes.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_10:1.0000:Her brow is placid and serene ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_11:1.0000:Her form the proudest e'er was seen ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_13:1.0000:She seems by nature pronounced a queen.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_14:1.0000:Her very presence hath a spell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_16:1.0000:To sit, and gaze, and only listen,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_17:1.0000:To catch her syllables as they fell.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_18:1.0000:Her heart, they say, hath boundless worth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_19:1.0000:Her beauty scarce can symbol forth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_20:1.0000:In her, a spirit meet for Heaven,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0114_21:1.0000:Its gentle influence sheds on earth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_1:1.0000:Unmarked amid the passing throng,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_2:1.0000:These eyes have gazed enraptured long ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_3:1.0000:This heart hath throbbed with wild emotion,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_4:1.0000:That fain would break and outpour in song !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_5:0.9750:I could a tale of love unfold ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_6:1.0000:But the truth were just as well untold ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_7:1.0000:'Tis precious little for me she careth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_8:1.0000:A rusty bachelor forty years old ! !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_9:0.9500:But with thy leave, Saint Valentine,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_10:1.0000:This wreath of poesy I'll twine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0115_11:0.9750:But whence it comes, and who's the author,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_2:0.9500:THOU hast the wealth of beauty ; them art fair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_6:0.9750:Thou hast the wealth of mind ; to quest of lore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_8:0.9750:And glorious thing in woman hast in store
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_9:0.9500:Treasures of thought, of wisdom, and of truth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_10:0.9500:Thou hast the wealth of soul ; that nobler part,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_11:1.0000:In all its depth and plenitude is thine,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_12:1.0000:Which gives the richest graces to the heart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_13:1.0000:And makes us kindred of a race divine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_14:0.9750:Thus, thrice-endowed with wealth, I may not doubt
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_15:1.0000:That whosoe'er thyself and thine shall win ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_16:1.0000:Will find a temple, beautiful without,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0116_17:0.9750:And ornamented gorgeously within.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_6:1.0000:That hollowed out the bay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_7:1.0000:And smote the outer, rock-ribbed hill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_8:1.0000:To ope a golden way
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_9:1.0000:For sea and ship, for home and hope ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_10:0.9750:Was equal in behest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_11:1.0000:That man should plant on yonder slope
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_13:1.0000:The long, low beach of sedge and vines ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_14:1.0000:The slow-retreating plain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_15:1.0000:The emerald upland, which reclines
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_16:1.0000:Against the mountain chain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_17:0.9750:Whose steep ascent and swelling girth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_18:0.9750:Lend dignifying powers
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_19:1.0000:To that choice spot of all the earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_20:1.0000:For academic towers !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_21:0.9750:O, beauteous scene for brain and heart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_22:1.0000:Our students' life beguiles ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_23:1.0000:The sleeping vale, the teeming mart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0117_24:1.0000:The ocean and the isles !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_2:1.0000:Of motion and repose ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_3:1.0000:With morn's impenetrable haze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_4:1.0000:With evening's gorgeous close !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_5:0.9750:With shimmering noon, and glittering night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_6:1.0000:Of such translucent beam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_7:1.0000:As on the meditative sight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_8:1.0000:Eevives the Berkeleyan dream !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_9:0.9750:Where wintry snows are never known,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_10:1.0000:Nor enervating heat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_11:0.9750:Within the isothermal zone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_12:1.0000:A sure and perfect seat.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_13:0.9750:Where nature for the site supplies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_15:0.9750:A bounteous wisdom justifies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_16:1.0000:The Nation and the State.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_17:1.0000:And, thanks to many a noble friend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_18:1.0000:Of unsectarian aim,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_19:0.9750:Whose large endowments here descend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_20:1.0000:With honor to his name.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_21:1.0000:And, thanks for toil in leading chairs,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_22:1.0000:By men of cultured skill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_23:1.0000:Who, 'mid a thousand teasing cares,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0118_24:0.9750:Have kept an even will.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_1:0.9750:Auspicious history ! From this page
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_2:1.0000:We lift a trustful gaze ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_3:1.0000:Though weightiest issues mark the Age,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_6:1.0000:Thy banners never furled !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_7:1.0000:While Time may last, thou shalt retain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_8:1.0000:The Outlook of a world !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_9:1.0000:Fair priestess ! who shall yet indite
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_10:1.0000:Ten thousand glorious names ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_11:1.0000:With reverent sentiments to-night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_12:0.9750:We dare invoke thy flames !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_13:1.0000:" Room for Reformers ! with their sovereign plan
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_14:0.9750:To heal or mitigate the woes of man."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_15:1.0000:The cry is ancient as our Nation's time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_16:1.0000:Yet born anew in every tapster's rhyme.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_17:1.0000:The field has widened at each fresh demand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_18:1.0000:Till desk and forum ope on every hand.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_20:1.0000:Of those whose theory is the " Latest out."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_21:1.0000:Nor less potential is the summons borne
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_22:1.0000:To found a sect, or lift a race forlorn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0119_23:1.0000:Or force a city corner upon corn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_2:0.9750:The long-eared medium, and the short-haired quack.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_4:1.0000:Sketched in resolve and molded into Law ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_5:0.9750:By which in perils unsurpassed they stood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_6:1.0000:Built with their bones, cemented with their blood :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_10:0.9500:Won through a bloodless martyrdom of shame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_11:1.0000:Pretending now a scientific lore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_12:1.0000:And now a message from the ' other shore ;'
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_13:1.0000:In either case prepared to tell, in terms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_14:1.0000:The grandest compound and the primal germs ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_15:1.0000:Rehearsing nonsense in exultant tone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_16:1.0000:As if the lectures made creation groan ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_17:1.0000:In any case, prepared to scoff and sneer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_18:0.9750:At every custom decency holds dear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_19:1.0000:Seducing ignorance with lascivious charms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_20:0.9750:And healthy conscience stinging with alarms.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_21:1.0000:Such are Outriders, on the secular coasts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_22:1.0000:For less unselfish, less courageous hosts ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0120_23:0.9750:Who now disclaim, and afterwards suggest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_1:0.9500:With cunning glance, to note in every move
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_3:1.0000:Lest they should fail to pander, just in time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_4:1.0000:To some new doctrine, vicious but " sublime 1"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_5:1.0000:See worthy subjects for the prison lock,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_6:1.0000:Unblushing labor with the corporate stock,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_7:1.0000:To cover up the robbery of a ring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_8:1.0000:Or fast enthrone some great monopoly king ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_9:1.0000:Until the people, rising in a storm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_10:1.0000:Announce their temper for a real reform.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_11:0.9750:When Lo ! the foremost, with the loudest cheer,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_12:1.0000:These rear-guard veterans suddenly appear !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_13:1.0000:Their functions now a double game of cheat :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_14:0.9500:Shape voted verdicts to a flat defeat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_15:1.0000:The while they make their own promotion sure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_16:0.9750:And preach a flattering gospel to the poor ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_17:1.0000:Then in some office, lucrative and warm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_18:1.0000:They whisper sadly of a lost Reform !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_19:0.9500:Behold the highest council in the land I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_20:1.0000:What men dishonored ! and what rogues com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_21:0.9500:mand !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_22:1.0000:The jovial scoundrel (or the lucky fool),
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_23:1.0000:Rich from his ventures in a gambler's pool,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_24:1.0000:For bigger tricks, or personal regard,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0121_25:0.9750:Concludes to take the senatorial card.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_4:0.9750:A monthly stipend, and a mammoth press.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_5:0.9750:Pensions electors and the hovering scribes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_7:0.9750:Assumes the toga with an easy air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_17:1.0000:The social standard of our earlier days ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_18:0.9500:When thieves, by purchasing official place,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0122_25:0.9500:The moral burdens in the realm they share.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_2:1.0000:The view and purpose of a sordid thing.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_3:1.0000:Perhaps buy out, and run with vengeful cast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_4:0.9500:Some well-born journal with an honored past.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_6:0.9750:Misquote large markets, and old " jobs " prolong.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_7:1.0000:Inlay their columns with the tales that smirch,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_8:0.9750:And pass the platter in the wealthiest church.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_9:0.9500:Spurn trifling offers from the babbling trade,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_10:1.0000:And keep their virtue on a dress parade ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_11:1.0000:Maintain their cipher at the thousandth score,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_12:1.0000:And shed contempt on every dollar store.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_13:1.0000:Let others falter with a timid qualm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_14:0.9500:Their voice, we know, is always for Reform.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_15:0.9500:A tearful pity touches the distress
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_16:1.0000:Of those compelled to read our neutral Press.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_18:1.0000:In reckless grammar, to the very verge
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_19:1.0000:Of dire conclusions on the mooted head,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_20:1.0000:Of what was once surmised to have been said.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_21:0.9750:Who can presume to adequately greet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_22:1.0000:The fervid, candid, superficial sheet ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_23:1.0000:Where every flabby " Reformation " scheme,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0123_24:1.0000:Creed of fanatic, and the sick man's dream,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_5:1.0000:In tireless iteration making known
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_6:0.9500:A Balance Kegulator, all his own !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_7:1.0000:A short, infallible, perspicuous code,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_8:0.9750:Which sets each subject his appropriate load.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_9:0.9750:The very rich shall all the taxes pay ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_10:1.0000:The very poor need only vote and play.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_11:1.0000:The prentice builders shall their wages rate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_12:0.9500:And draw an extra tribute from the State ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_13:0.9500:While those who mark the trestle-board and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_17:0.9750:Combat agrarians, and the lecturing tramps?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_18:1.0000:To real complaints appropriately reply ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_19:0.9750:To borrowed doubts return the reasons why ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_20:1.0000:With pleasing humor dissipate their chaff,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_21:0.9750:And send their problems to the idiot's laugh ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_22:0.9750:Incline the people for the public weal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_23:0.9500:To crush their counsels with contemptuous heel ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0124_24:0.9500:The mighty gulfs resistlessly present,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_1:0.9500:niuine anew the pathway and the scope
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_2:0.9500:Of careful judgment and a healthy Hope ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_3:1.0000:For such a service welcomed in the van
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_4:0.9750:Expect the College-educated man !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_5:1.0000:To some, a special and a noble call :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_6:1.0000:A sphere of duty, more or less, to all.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_7:1.0000:What though uncounted thousands never own
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_8:1.0000:The debt in such essential service grown ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_9:1.0000:What though a legion cannot understand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_10:1.0000:That any dangers shadow o'er the land ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_11:1.0000:And, least of all, suspect explosive force
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_13:0.9500:Though every warning is decried and hissed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_14:1.0000:The threats portentious and the debt exist.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_15:1.0000:And O, the grateful tribute, on this score,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_16:1.0000:Due the alumni who have gone before !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_17:1.0000:Enough of surface thinking in the land.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_18:1.0000:Sufficient privilege at each youth's command.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_19:1.0000:More than enough of Proverb lore extant,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_20:1.0000:Oft wreathed in context of revolting cant.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_21:1.0000:As well predict a harvest-field of grain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_22:1.0000:On arid hill-side or Sahara plain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_23:1.0000:From equinoctials and the lunar heat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0125_24:1.0000:As with the tribes of ignorant conceit
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_1:0.9500:Hely alone for fructifying powers
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_2:0.9750:On wealth's rewards and moral saw-dust showers.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_3:0.9750:The need momentous is the souls combined
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_4:1.0000:With quick, electric, cultivated mind ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_5:1.0000:At whose decree economies shall rest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_6:1.0000:Beneath profound, inexorable test.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_7:1.0000:With no detraction of the highest force
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_8:1.0000:We speak emphatic for the College course.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_9:1.0000:Since history's pages, at each calm review,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_10:1.0000:Approve the framers, " wiser than they knew."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_11:1.0000:The fostered relish for established fact,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_12:1.0000:The root of structure and the sum exact.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_13:0.9750:The mental habits which the schools have shown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_14:0.9750:Wed to the nerves and bred into the bone.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_15:1.0000:The days appointed and the tasks assigned
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_16:1.0000:To try the vigor of the pupil's mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_17:1.0000:Before a bench of criticizing friends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_18:0.9500:Whose cheering counsel with their censure blends.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_19:0.9750:The builded will to check the Fancy's haste,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_20:1.0000:And make it wait on judgment and on taste.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_21:1.0000:The fine attrition in the class retreat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_23:0.9750:The duress for self-introspection keen ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_24:1.0000:The hard, remorseless wearing of the green.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_25:0.9750:The glorious sovereignty which this drill implies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0126_26:0.9500:To summon, portion, point, and focalize ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_2:0.9750:Feel the white burning of harmonious powers ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_4:0.9500:Till law and contrast drive the statement home.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_5:0.9500:Vast opportunities denote,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_6:1.0000:The deepening want for men,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_7:1.0000:Whose discipline shall antidote
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_8:1.0000:The shams of speech and pen.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_9:1.0000:Whose quenchless passion for the truth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_10:1.0000:Shall find a scholar's art,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_11:1.0000:As from the fresh, brave soul of youth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_12:1.0000:The fit suggestions start.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_13:0.9750:Here grandest fruits of sound review
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_14:1.0000:In physics and in thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_15:0.9750:With all the lights of Science new,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_16:0.9750:Instructingly are brought.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_18:0.9750:With Learning and with Love ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_19:1.0000:Where Logic's iron hand is hid
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_20:1.0000:Within the knightly glove.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_21:0.9750:Priestess of Wisdom! In whose torch
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_22:1.0000:The lights of satire play :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_23:1.0000:Grant its imparted fires may scorch
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0127_24:1.0000:The falsehoods of the day.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_2:1.0000:The censers by thy side !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_3:1.0000:Inspire the God-sons thou shalt know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_5:1.0000:And guard the children of thy heart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_6:1.0000:Linked in a mystic grace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_7:1.0000:As from thy altars they depart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_8:1.0000:To take their waiting place.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_9:0.9750:No vaunt of spirit or of mein,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_10:1.0000:No over-zeal for strife ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0128_11:1.0000:But ready for each earnest scene
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0129_12:0.9500:No sound of axe or metal tool, through all the time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_3:0.9750:Who, through the progress of the work, the heavy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_12:0.9500:ow's son.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_13:0.9500:The columns and pilasters were of Parian marble
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_15:0.9750:The timbers from the famous groves of Lebanon
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_17:0.9500:Of cedar, fir, and olive wood, the stately walls were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_18:0.9750:made ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0130_19:0.9750:And all within, and all without, with gold was over-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0131_15:0.9500:And generations have been born, have flourished
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0131_17:0.9500:Since wrought our ancient brethren on that Temple's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0131_21:0.9500:The Temple, with its wondrous strength, hath yield-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0132_3:1.0000:The other holds its vigorous life, untouched by
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0132_5:0.9750:Long may it live, through coming years its excel-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0132_6:0.9500:lence to prove,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0132_9:0.9500:to see,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_4:0.9500:THE muse who is courted scarce once in a year,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_5:0.9500:Is apt to grow shy, when you wish she'd draw near.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_6:0.9500:Like most other divinities, she too prefers
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_8:1.0000:So I found yester eve, as I made invocation
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_9:1.0000:For aid in a forthcoming tight situation ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_10:0.9750:For all my advances she met with a slight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_11:0.9750:And said, " Poets, like Masons, had better keep
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_12:0.9500:bright."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_14:1.0000:Or some sensation theme, like the new style of bon-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_17:1.0000:With the vast, overhanging, immense portico !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_20:0.9500:But 'twas plain to be seen which would triumph at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_22:0.9750:So she hastily twined this rude garland of song,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0133_23:1.0000:And bestowed it on me and I brought it along.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_2:0.9750:Toward the same fated goal where the dark waters
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_5:0.9750:To recall that we're brothers and feel that we're
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_7:0.9750:All along on our march, if we will but behold
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_8:0.9500:Life's sunny oases their beauties unfold ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_10:1.0000:Like the Craftsman of old, at the brow of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_11:1.0000:We honor the Order, whose festival day
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_12:1.0000:Brings the brotherhood hither in gladsome array,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_13:0.9500:To join in this ancient, fraternal communion,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_14:1.0000:This cordial, old-fashioned Masonic re-union.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_16:0.9500:Make each man with his fellow a recognized peer ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_20:1.0000:Whose ritual, solemn, antique and sublime ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_21:0.9750:Outliving its history lasting as time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_22:1.0000:Still charms and controls with its mystical sway,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0134_23:0.9750:As in Solomon's reign and Zerubbabel's day.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_2:0.9750:Equal favors on all on the lofty and low ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_3:1.0000:High as heaven, broad as earth, deep as nethermost
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_6:0.9500:We ope not our portals at wealth's proud behest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_7:0.9500:Nor to fame with her plume and heraldical crest ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_8:0.9500:But to him, high or humble, who honestly brings
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_13:0.9750:Or the fabric in which one worm dresseth another,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_20:1.0000:Its presence is heeded in every zone ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_21:0.9500:By priest on the altar, by prince on his throne ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_22:0.9500:Wheresoever the tribes and the races belong,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0135_23:0.9750:Lo ! Masonry's vast multitudinous throng !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_6:1.0000:And much as I expected,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_8:0.9750:" My boy, you're just elected !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_9:1.0000:So make a speech, or sing a song !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_10:1.0000:(They say that Cincinnatus
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_11:1.0000:Presents a chap, who's troubled, too,*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_13:0.9500:This morn, as Sol rose in the East,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_14:1.0000:To <!all his craft to labor ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_15:1.0000:" Come, come ! " said he, " it's time for you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_16:0.9750:To stir yourself, my neighbor !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_18:1.0000:My adolescent brother ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0137_19:1.0000:Said I " Don't call me that again ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_1:0.9750:Don't think because you closed your Lodge
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_2:1.0000:So gloriously last even ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_3:1.0000:And left us striving to peer through
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_4:1.0000:That golden gate to Heaven ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_5:1.0000:And cheered sweet Orient with a smile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_6:1.0000:And, like a gallant lover,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_7:1.0000:Dispelled the gloom, and placed instead
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_9:1.0000:Don't think," said I, " to rise at morn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_10:1.0000:Behind that mask up yonder ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_11:1.0000:And chase our pleasant dreams away
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_12:1.0000:By muttering so like thunder !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_13:1.0000:And don't I beg you don't repeat
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_14:1.0000:Those tricks in hydrostatics ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_15:1.0000:Which make poor Luna hide her face,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_16:1.0000:And give me such rheumatics !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_18:1.0000:A feast of love and reason
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_19:1.0000:And celebrate, with right good will,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_20:0.9750:This rare old festive season ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_21:1.0000:But how am I to keep the step,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_22:1.0000:Or swing a dext'rous gavel,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_23:1.0000:"With all these .twinges at the joints,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0138_24:0.9750:To plague me while I travel ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_2:0.9500:" Don't fret in such a manner;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_3:1.0000:The time is up, and brothers now
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_4:1.0000:Are rallying 'neath your banner.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_6:1.0000:To serve his fellows, gladly ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_7:1.0000:You know the rest so don't desert
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_8:1.0000:Your colors quite so badly ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_9:1.0000:So here I come all out of breath
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_10:1.0000:But if you would " see Sam ; "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_11:1.0000:Or ask if he's among this throng,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_12:1.0000:I beg to state "lam!"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_13:1.0000:I'm always there, in soul or flesh,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_14:1.0000:In spite of adverse weather,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_15:1.0000:Where, in the bonds that bind true hearts.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_16:1.0000:True men are met together.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_17:1.0000:And very pleasant 'tis to gaze
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_18:0.9750:On scenes like these, my friends ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_19:1.0000:Where brothers meet in glad embrace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_20:1.0000:And wit with wisdom blends ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_21:1.0000:Where beauty smiles to crown the feast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_22:0.9750:And music breathes her strain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_23:1.0000:Where youth exults with high impulse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0139_24:0.9750:And age is youth again !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_1:1.0000:O, what are all the baubles worth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_2:1.0000:We strive to win and save,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_3:1.0000:While scrambling, as we blindly do,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_4:1.0000:From cradle on, to grave !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_5:1.0000:We go shell-gathering all our days,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_6:1.0000:As babes, as boys, as men ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_7:1.0000:While still the solemn question comes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_9:0.9500:The time is up ; chop off the string !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_10:1.0000:Now, join, each grateful brother !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_11:0.9750:And mark, kind friends, who're not of us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0140_14:0.9750:Ye men of high endeavor ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_3:0.9750:I TAKE the old familiar walk
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_4:1.0000:To the brow of the pleasant hill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_5:1.0000:From whence we've watched the evening sun
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_6:1.0000:Its parting rays distil.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_7:1.0000:I stand upon the oaken bridge,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_8:1.0000:And mark the waters glide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_9:1.0000:The same as I have seen them, dear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_10:1.0000:When seated at your side.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_11:1.0000:And O ! my heart, it will go back,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_12:1.0000:I cannot keep it still,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_13:1.0000:I cannot change its tortuous track
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_14:1.0000:By virtue of my will.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_15:1.0000:And I wonder sadly, strangely,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_16:1.0000:If there yet a heart may be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_17:0.9750:Whoso memories of olden time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_18:0.9750:Are somehow linked with me !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_19:0.9750:There's not a bush, or briar, or tree,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_20:1.0000:I see no wayside flower,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_21:0.9750:But what suggests some thought, of thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0141_22:1.0000:As of a long-flown hour.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_1:0.9750:Kind nature tunes her various voice
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_2:1.0000:To suit my listening ear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_3:1.0000:The breezes do not now rejoice,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_4:0.9500:No laughing stream I hear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_5:1.0000:But a soft and plaintive song is borne
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_6:1.0000:From the circling mountain slopes ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_7:1.0000:And the murmuring river seems to mourn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_8:1.0000:The dirges of my hopes :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_9:1.0000:As I wonder sadly, strangely,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_10:1.0000:If there yet a heart may be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_11:1.0000:Whose pleasant memories of old
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_12:0.9750:Are somehow linked with me !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_13:1.0000:No hot and feverish state of brain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_14:1.0000:Induces me to find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_15:1.0000:In yon half-burned and ruined mill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_16:1.0000:A picture of my mind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_17:1.0000:Its fallen timbers, charred and black,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_18:1.0000:Its flood-gates swept away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_19:1.0000:Appropriate types they well may seem
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_20:0.9750:Of my premature decay.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_21:1.0000:Through the swollen dam, unceasingly,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_22:1.0000:The swollen torrents roll ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_23:1.0000:So pour the streams of inner life
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0142_24:1.0000:O'er the embers of my soul.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_1:1.0000:And I wonder sadly, strangely,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_2:1.0000:If there yet a heart might be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_3:1.0000:Whose memories of olden time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_5:1.0000:If e'er thy feet retrace the paths
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_6:1.0000:In the meadows and the glade,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_7:1.0000:Where oft, in love's communion sweet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_8:1.0000:Together we have strayed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_9:0.9750:And the thought of an olden time rise up,-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_10:1.0000:Thy soul's unbidden guest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_11:1.0000:Think of me at my best, dearest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_12:0.9750:Think of me at my best.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_13:1.0000:For I ne'er shall view the evening sun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_14:1.0000:From the brow of the pleasant hill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_15:1.0000:Or stand upon the oaken bridge,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_16:1.0000:Above the ruined mill,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_17:1.0000:But I shall wonder, O how sadly!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_18:1.0000:If one noble heart there be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_19:0.9500:Whoso tender dreams of bygone scenes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0143_20:1.0000:Are somehow linked with me !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0144_8:0.9750:With lightning flash, through watery depths that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0144_22:0.9500:As bridegroom and as bride, rejoice in wedlock firm
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_9:0.9750:I've tossed and foamed, and roared between, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_11:0.9500:But all for nought ; e'en now the rogues are whis-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_12:0.9500:pering to each other !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_14:0.9500:quering tread,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_15:0.9750:And praise thee for this last and greatest blessing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_19:0.9750:That hence shall flow to benefit the world's great
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_20:0.9500:brotherhood !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0145_21:0.9750:And thanks, our heartfelt thanks to them, the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_3:0.9750:The grand achievement of the age, in triumph to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_5:0.9750:The Cyrus of the olden time, for deeds of valor
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_7:1.0000:A deathless name emblazoned on the page of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_9:1.0000:And school boys now, in solemn quest of ancient
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_10:0.9500:Grecian lore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_11:1.0000:Peruse his dying speech ; and wish he'd died an
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_15:1.0000:No thousands of the enemy lie stretched upon the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_16:0.9500:plain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_17:1.0000:A nobler victory by far, our Berkshire boy shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_18:1.0000:claim ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_19:0.9500:A loftier niche is hewn for him within the halls of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_22:0.9500:praise we sing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0146_23:1.0000:The hero of a bloodless fight, hath conquered
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0147_3:0.9750:Our thought 'shall still dart through the deep, in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0147_6:0.9750:glory be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0147_7:0.9750:Who giveth man to hold enchained, the everlasting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0147_9:0.9750:To tame the lightnings, rule the winds, the continent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_3:0.9750:It seems as 'twere full many a year !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_4:1.0000:Before, time was a shallow stream ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_5:1.0000:It deepened in love's radiant beam.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_6:1.0000:Before, I felt earth's cares alone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_7:1.0000:Now, sweetest joys and hopes are known.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_8:1.0000:All ! what experience can it be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_9:1.0000:That fires this finer life in me ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_10:0.9750:Something from out my heart is given
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_11:1.0000:Something has filled my soul with Heaven.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_12:1.0000:The world's best praise, its slanderous sneer,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_13:1.0000:I neither covet now, nor fear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_14:1.0000:O ! what has wrought this mighty change,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_15:1.0000:To me inexplicably strange ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0148_16:1.0000:Tell me, my dear, for you must know,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0149_9:0.9500:With notions quickened by the gaze of certain orbs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0149_13:0.9500:Who, thinks, no doubt, the feast is best when most
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_3:1.0000:And better read men supersede the red men long
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_5:1.0000:Thanks to the Colonel ! generous soul, who shelled
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_8:0.9500:words of cheer ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_9:0.9750:Who caught, in hope and faith, some glimpse of this
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_15:1.0000:And makes them sufferers while they live, but he-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_17:0.9500:The jealous dame but dealeth right, and history ceas-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_18:0.9750:eth never
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_19:0.9750:To show how self decays with self, but good deeds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_20:1.0000:live forever.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0150_21:0.9500:That generous gift bestowed in faith, in fortune's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_9:0.9500:pride ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_10:0.9500:Ere life's expanding bud had fairly opened into
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_16:0.9500:How far abroad that little torch should send its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_18:1.0000:Nor how, through all the centuries, its life-impart-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_20:1.0000:Should help illumine isles afar, and set the earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0151_21:0.9750:ablaze !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_1:1.0000:The grandest awe invests our life ; and conscience
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_3:0.9750:What wondrous possibilities attend each thought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_7:1.0000:And pause a moment to survey the beauty of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_8:0.9750:scene.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_9:0.9500:Let Memory, smiling through her tears, her garner-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_17:0.9500:The sky o'erhead appears to hold its primitive con-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_20:0.9750:tion.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0152_23:0.9500:The engine shrieks where once was heard the In-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0153_6:0.9750:like the name ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0153_11:0.9500:To welcome home her gallant sons, and note their
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0153_17:0.9500:And bids them go where duty calls, wherever that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0153_21:0.9750:And hither, on each natal day, come fresh men by
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0153_23:0.9750:To fill the void, and, in their turn, to tread these
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_2:0.9750:found peers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_3:0.9500:To gather the experiences of these bright college
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_5:0.9500:And hither, also, we have come, to hold our brief
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_6:0.9500:re-union ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_7:0.9750:To meet once more beneath these shades in sweet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_9:0.9750:Our mother's waist has ampler grown ; more numer-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_11:0.9750:Her sunshine bringeth sure return in ceaseless gold-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_13:0.9500:But, Alma Mater ! as we stand around the family
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_14:1.0000:tree,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_15:1.0000:Thou dost not show us, after all, what most we long
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_16:0.9750:to see.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_17:1.0000:Thy very words of welcome do but send our thoughts
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_18:0.9500:astray,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_21:0.9750:The very forms that now respond to names of " auld
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_22:0.9500:lang syne,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0154_23:1.0000:Bear marks of life's approaching noon, or afternoon's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0155_3:0.9750:For such the death-star speaks the truth we need
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0155_13:0.9500:And now to FORTRESS WILLIAMS, a parting toast is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_2:0.9500:I CANNOT praise thine eye, thy form ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_3:1.0000:I cannot tell the faith I place :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_4:1.0000:"Within thy heart so kind and warm
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_5:1.0000:I could not number every grace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_6:1.0000:My tongue refuses to declare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_7:1.0000:The fascinations which I feel ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_8:1.0000:Nay, while the blissful bond we share,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_9:1.0000:Why search the figures on the seal ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_10:0.9750:Our full communion, strong in health,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_11:1.0000:No selfish reckoning abides ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_12:1.0000:Open and free we hold our wealth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_13:1.0000:Not as the miser counts and hides.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_14:1.0000:Yet, not in passion's fevered school
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_15:1.0000:Have we attained our mutual thought ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_16:0.9750:The worthiest judgment bore the rule,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_17:0.9750:And into love wise sanction wrought.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_20:0.9750:'Till time's swift river finds release
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0156_21:0.9500:Within the unencircled main.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_5:1.0000:A young man approached me and uttered his warn-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_13:0.9500:May n't I mingle, forsooth, in these festival scenes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_16:1.0000:I never fight duels ; I ne'er was put through
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_17:1.0000:The diet of pistols and coffee for two ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_18:0.9750:So I tell you, my friend, with an emphasis stout,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0157_19:0.9500:I'll be shot if I stand it : I won't be called out ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0158_2:0.9750:I'm trying to help you get out of a scrape.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0158_3:0.9750:You see, years ago, it's no business of mine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0158_4:1.0000:But you flirted, they say, with the musical Nine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0158_6:1.0000:You cherished a passion you haven't outgrown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0158_18:0.9750:I bid you be drinking : fill up the glass then,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0159_10:0.9500:Far aloft, never doubt, up in heaven's free air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0159_14:0.9500:The red, white and blue, and the spangles of gold ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0159_15:0.9500:Still proudly, still firm to the breezes unfurled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0159_16:0.9500:The hope of the nations ; the joy of the world !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_5:1.0000:Adepts and bunglers in the art of song ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_6:1.0000:Before whose shrine in loyal homage bent,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_7:0.9750:Unnumbered bards their votive gifts present ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_8:0.9500:Behold ; another suppliant stands aloof,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_9:1.0000:Impatient, noting each severe reproof
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_10:1.0000:To hapfess mortals, as they venture near,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_11:0.9500:" Begone, impostors ! pray how came ye here ? "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_13:1.0000:Which holds such empire o'er the human heart ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_15:1.0000:I plead like Brutus " hear me for my cause ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_16:1.0000:In bygone days, ere yet with reverent awe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_17:1.0000:I dared approach the sages of the law :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_18:1.0000:Ere yet from day-dreams of my youth I woke,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_19:1.0000:To grapple Blackstone, and contend with Coke ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_20:0.9500:To drudge and labor for litigious men,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0160_23:0.9750:And all its scenery wore a roseate hue ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_6:1.0000:So might her sons, who bid me now essay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_8:0.9750:And, home returning, having wandered long,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_12:0.9500:Touch with thy sceptre its neglected strings,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_13:0.9750:Shape these rude numbers as thy suppliant sings ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_15:1.0000:This rare occasion, this inspiring scene.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_16:0.9750:Fratres Alumni ! from each busy sphere
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_21:1.0000:The facts of science, and the classic lore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0161_22:0.9750:Embalmed forever in the glorious tongue
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_5:0.9500:We hailed our first proud impulses as men ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_6:1.0000:Here haply gathered, well I know what theme
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_7:1.0000:Lends inspiration to each waking dream.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_8:0.9500:The realm of Memories, on this day of days,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_13:0.9750:Our all of life all that we have and are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_14:0.9750:Extends a welcome hand, while thus we own
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_15:1.0000:Our just allegiance to her mighty throne.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_16:1.0000:Blessed of mortals is the man whose heart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_17:1.0000:Preserveth ever from the world apart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_18:1.0000:Some choice retreat, within whose sacred walls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_19:0.9750:The olden memories hold their festivals.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_23:1.0000:And floats the incense of life's vernal flowers.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_24:1.0000:Before whose guarded, tabernacled shrine,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0162_25:1.0000:Maternal prayers attend in shapes divine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_2:1.0000:Their sweet notes warble in delicious flow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_3:1.0000:Beneath such mortal's form, howe'er uncouth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_4:0.9750:Be sure, upsprings the fount of endless youth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_5:1.0000:Somewhat that's human, ever in his breast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_7:0.9750:Something is throbbing, 'neath whatever disguise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_8:0.9500:That may be touched with generous sympathies.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_9:0.9750:Some such kind motor, brothers, is it not ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_10:0.9750:Hath brought ye hither to this cherished spot,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_11:0.9750:Of old-time scenes, some transient glimpse to gain;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_12:0.9500:Be view the by-gones, and be boys again.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_13:0.9750:MEMORIES my theme : Oh ! list kind friends the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_15:1.0000:The gentle muse bespeaks your gracious smile.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_16:0.9750:Pray don't forget, though this is classic ground,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_19:0.9500:Is no professor, but an amateur.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_20:1.0000:Attend, ye doctors ! to the dogs give over
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_21:1.0000:Doses of physic, while the men recover ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_22:1.0000:While Pegasus shall limp before your eyes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_23:0.9750:He'll give your patience healthful exercise.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0163_24:0.9500:Hear ye, attorneys ! don't, for once, demur ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_8:0.9750:In teaching those " young idiots how to shout,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_9:0.9750:Commit a while the text-books to their shelves,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_13:0.9750:Beware ! lest I avenge my jealous muse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_17:1.0000:Across our minds, as Time revolves his never-halting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_18:0.9750:wheel ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_19:1.0000:The pleasant thoughts that cluster round the old
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_21:1.0000:Be these our priv'leged visitants thro' all the years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_23:1.0000:Perhaps it was a humble cot, where frugal meals
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0164_24:0.9500:were spread ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_6:0.9750:Whether the boy went barefooted, or clad in rich
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_7:0.9750:attire ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_10:0.9500:Or patient being, long inured to housewife toil and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_11:0.9500:care.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_12:0.9500:Ah, no ! it is not circumstance of outward good or
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_16:0.9750:For, whether carved elaborate, or plainly wrought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_18:0.9500:Our memory's faithful portraiture attracts and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_20:0.9750:That was a proud, eventful day, when first the hope-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0165_22:0.9750:Forsook the age of baby frocks, and put those
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_3:1.0000:To think how grand he marched to church, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_5:1.0000:That jacket, with the buttons on! their brilliance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_7:0.9500:Beat every badge or epaulette the fellow since has
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_8:0.9500:worn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_9:1.0000:And there were pockets big enough for knife, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_11:0.9750:The boy was hero then, be sure, and happy as a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_13:0.9750:And you'll remember, like enough, about that fa-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_15:0.9750:With hickory runners, natural crook, and painted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_19:0.9750:And had, upon the school-house hill, a quite distin-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0166_21:0.9750:And when you coasted, after school ; I hope you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_3:0.9500:others grew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_4:1.0000:To offer little Jane a chance to slide down hill with
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_6:1.0000:That ancient school-house holds a place in memory
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_8:0.9500:Where tasks seemed so impossible, and time so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_11:0.9750:eared o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_14:0.9750:And if, perchance, you overstepped that most pre-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_16:0.9750:And stood convicted of the crime of whispering in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_17:0.9500:school ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_18:1.0000:Ah, me! what childish penitence came trembling
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_20:0.9750:As o'er your head, " you rascal, sir ! " that birchen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_22:1.0000:Those well-worn desks, if standing yet, I'll venture
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0167_24:0.9750:Along their honored surfaces, your famed initials
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_3:0.9500:But now, the letters stand askew, and one is upside
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_5:0.9750:Of merry Christmas holidays, shall I forget to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_6:0.9750:sing?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_9:1.0000:When all the household was aglow with festive mirth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_10:0.9750:and glee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_11:0.9750:And each young urchin donn'd his wreath, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_13:1.0000:Those rows of stockings, round the hearth, arranged
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_17:0.9750:How oft we strove to keep awake, so haply we might
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_18:0.9750:hear
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_19:1.0000:The clattering sound on housetop, of the phantom
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_21:0.9500:And how, as morning dimly dawned, with emulous
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0168_23:1.0000:Resounded merry welcomings to loving dame and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_3:0.9500:And in its turn each stocking-full was duly invento-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_5:0.9750:The feast, too, was a grand affair ; when all the aunts
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_7:0.9750:Were congregated round the board in numbers told
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_9:0.9750:No Saratoga can restore to us dyspeptic sin-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_11:1.0000:The appetites that lent the sauce to those prodig-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_13:1.0000:The old church, with its moss-grown tower, whose
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_15:0.9500:The grandest architectural feat the race had e'er
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_17:1.0000:Has now a double sacredness, as, after years have
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_19:0.9750:You see what kindly influences about your path it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_21:0.9500:How grateful on the list'ning ear, on Sabbath morn-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_22:0.9500:ing, fell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0169_23:0.9750:The never-failing summons of the sweet church-go-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_1:0.9500:The old church-bell ! how, latterly, with pleased sur-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_3:0.9750:What else-neglected memories wake in freshness at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_4:1.0000:its tone !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_5:0.9750:There, in the wonted place of prayer, and thankful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_7:1.0000:You lent a happy, youthful face to that familiar
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_11:1.0000:And learned the sacred lesson, and the good old-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_12:0.9500:fashioned tune.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_13:0.9750:The gathered throng of worshipers is vastly changed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_14:0.9500:to-day ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_15:1.0000:And many a face is older grown, and most have
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_17:1.0000:The venerable forms you knew, as rapid years have
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_21:0.9500:The parson and the chorister have gone their sev-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_22:0.9500:eral ways ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0170_23:0.9750:Another voice from pulpit now, its messages con-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_6:0.9500:steeple rings,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_9:0.9750:Once more your pulses beat response to welcome
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_10:0.9500:peal and strain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_11:0.9500:And home, and youth, and all the dear old past are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_12:0.9750:back again !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_17:0.9500:Yet long as time's dominion lasts, it shall not be dis-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_19:0.9500:Around each spot what cherished thoughts and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0171_23:0.9500:Presents no feature to allure the casual passer-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_4:0.9500:a human face,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_5:0.9750:Gleams ever with a brighter glow, at thought of that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_10:0.9750:There was the wanderer's early home ; there, oft in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_11:1.0000:blissful dream,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_12:1.0000:Again he sports upon the knoll, or paddles in the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_13:1.0000:stream ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_14:0.9750:There each remembered rock and tree its vigil seems
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_15:0.9750:to hold
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_18:0.9500:This makes the poetry of life ; O, doubt not, gra-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_19:0.9500:cious friends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_20:0.9500:On each and all in some rare moods the gentle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_21:0.9750:muse descends.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_22:0.9750:Alas ! our words can ne'er repeat those finer strains
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0172_23:0.9750:that roll
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0173_9:0.9750:To merrier measure and rollicking rhyme,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0173_10:0.9750:The versatile muse bids our fancy keep tune ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0173_11:0.9750:While, just for the moment, wo pass in review
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0173_20:0.9500:Which their fond reminiscences serve to fill up ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0173_21:0.9750:No fraction of life-time contributed more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_1:0.9750:I hail the occasion, and bid ye retrace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_3:0.9500:Come, then, fellow-students, and banish your fears !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_7:0.9750:No matter to-day how your scholarship stands ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_9:1.0000:And as to who " flunked," or with " honors " was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_13:0.9500:" Colonel,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_16:0.9500:" Professor," or what-not ; but wasn't he green,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0174_23:1.0000:He started in quest of his room, and his chum.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_2:0.9750:Of its dense population, how little he knew !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_6:0.9500:ers.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_10:0.9750:Discovered how blarney ends often in smoke ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_13:1.0000:in!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_21:0.9750:And the youth of last year, very verdant and raw,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0175_22:0.9500:Came to have, in some sphere, quite distinguished
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_6:0.9500:clamation.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_7:0.9750:Perhaps you were famous for muscle ; and so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_8:1.0000:Whenever the class above yours, or below,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_9:0.9750:Undertook their superior force to declare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_10:0.9500:It was deemed quite essential that you should be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0176_20:1.0000:And of natural science, a learned revelator.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_2:1.0000:Tow'rd the orbs overhead for theatrical stars.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_4:0.9500:You thought more than you did of the man in the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_6:0.9750:And while your old chum was intently star-gazing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_14:1.0000:Perhaps with all book-lore your mind was imbued,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_15:0.9750:Excepting the text-books ; and those you eschewed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_16:0.9500:So, despite all the treasures you tried to amass,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0177_22:0.9500:While your fancies, thus quickened, accomplish the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_2:0.9750:well !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_9:1.0000:Whom to know, was to yield him the heart of a son.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_19:1.0000:Of tender memories, fain the muse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_20:1.0000:As pensively the past she views,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_21:1.0000:From out her store of fragrant fancies,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0178_22:1.0000:A wreath a delicate wreath, would choose.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_1:0.9500:Bomantic memories ; say, proud sir,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_2:0.9500:"Was aught so sweet of joys that were,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_3:1.0000:As troth to thee by fair one plighted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_4:1.0000:And thine, right loyally pledged to her ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_5:1.0000:How blissful were the moments spent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_6:0.9750:At eve, to loving converse lent,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_7:1.0000:Beneath the stars, whose roguish twinkle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_8:1.0000:Lumined the gorgeous firmament.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_9:1.0000:Perchance beneath the trysting tree.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_10:1.0000:Perchance beside the sobbing sea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_11:1.0000:Perchance where all the valley echoes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_12:1.0000:The rivulet's laughter, wild and free ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_13:1.0000:Perchance in bower, perchance in grove,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_14:1.0000:In cloistered court or dim alcove ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_15:1.0000:O, ever somewhere, somehow ever
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_16:1.0000:Gushes the tremulous syllable Love !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_17:1.0000:I wot she was a maiden fair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_18:0.9750:Her bonny face was free from care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_19:1.0000:How most angelic seemed each feature,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_20:1.0000:How like a halo her wreathed hair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_21:1.0000:And eyes of brown or azure hue
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_22:1.0000:Bespoke a nature fond and true ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_23:1.0000:A heart that should, with glad endeavor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0179_24:0.9500:Battle the ills of life with you.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_1:1.0000:How oft you mused with hands enclasped,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_2:1.0000:Conversed of present joys, and past,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_3:1.0000:And hopefully, through all the future,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_4:1.0000:Happy, adventurous vision cast.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_5:1.0000:The numerous years, perchance, have flown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_6:1.0000:Since first you caught the thrilling tone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_7:1.0000:From maiden lips so softly faltered,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_8:1.0000:Yielding a heart that was all your own.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_9:0.9750:The lips have lost their ruby now,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_10:0.9750:That erst pronounced the hallowed vow ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_11:0.9750:And time has since, with ruthless finger
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_12:0.9750:Written his autograph on that brow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_13:0.9750:Perchance more sad that form hath found
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_14:1.0000:Its last repose low in the ground ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_15:0.9750:And Death, remorseless, holds your treasure
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_16:1.0000:Hidden beneath a grassy mound.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_17:1.0000:And sometimes, as you chance to trace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_18:0.9750:In childhood's all-unconscious face,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_19:1.0000:Some likeness of that fond companion,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_20:1.0000:Summoned from thine to Christ's embrace ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_21:1.0000:Fain from itself the soul would flee ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_22:1.0000:For of God's rare gifts to such as we,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_23:0.9750:I almost seem to hear you sighing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0180_24:0.9750:" Saddest of all is Memory ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_3:0.9750:When faithless sons, with sacrilegious guilt,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_4:1.0000:Assail the structure which their fathers built,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_5:1.0000:The muse might sing, if need were, to instil
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_6:1.0000:In hearts like these a nobler zeal and will.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_7:0.9500:What glorious memories ! how they cluster round
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_8:0.9750:Each towering shaft and olden battle-ground.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_9:1.0000:What golden letters upon history's page
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_10:0.9750:Immortalize the hero and the sage,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_11:0.9750:Who saved our country from oppression's load,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_12:1.0000:And made her Freedom's favorite abode !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_13:0.9750:What memories hover o'er that ensign proud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_14:0.9750:Whose stripes and stars above the battle cloud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_15:1.0000:In Freedom's dawn, and high-advancing day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_16:1.0000:In glory shone, to glory led the way !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_17:1.0000:Beneath that banner, how, with lapse of time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_18:1.0000:Our land hath gained a prestige more sublime
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_19:1.0000:Than in historic annals can be told
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_20:0.9750:Of all the empires and the states of old.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_21:1.0000:Happy Columbia ! with thy memories crowned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_22:1.0000:Though traitors lurk, and envious foes surround,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_23:0.9500:Yet who that builds thee in his heart a shrine,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0181_26:0.9500:Thy sword, thy shield, thy scathless panoply.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_5:1.0000:hind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_6:1.0000:It is such courage as would fell to earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_7:0.9750:The very form of her who gave him birth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_8:1.0000:It is such courage as would pierce the breast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_9:1.0000:On which in infancy his face was pressed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_10:1.0000:Or level prostrate with insensate clods,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_11:1.0000:His fireside altars and his household gods.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_12:1.0000:Oh ! sure as truth, and truth's eternal laws,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_13:1.0000:"We hail the issue of so righteous cause,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_14:1.0000:And see before, as with prophetic eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_15:1.0000:The grand result the glorious victory.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_16:1.0000:And that great victory ; would that it might come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_17:1.0000:By war unheralded, or roll of drum.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_18:1.0000:Nay ; better, happier, nobler might it be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_19:1.0000:As from her tripod hints the Muse to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0182_20:0.9750:In the fullness of time I behold in my vision
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_4:0.9750:Hail, blessed re-union ; praise, praise to the Lord !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_7:1.0000:The sons of the North, with a brotherly grasp,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_11:0.9500:Then Memory, her mystical chords shall re-waken,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_13:0.9750:How precious the boon they had almost forsaken,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_17:0.9750:On altars now dim, and when calm-visaged Reason,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_19:0.9500:Then as ever, Columbia, advancing in glory,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0183_22:0.9500:Who shall rise up to call us their forefathers-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_1:0.9750:Of grand old memories, such as live sublime
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_2:1.0000:In olden history, or in classic rhyme ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_3:1.0000:Of legend memories, haply passed along
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_4:1.0000:In dim tradition, or unlettered song ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_5:1.0000:Of local memories, we have cherished well
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_6:1.0000:In curious tales we heard our grandams tell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_7:1.0000:Of ghost and spectre dusky squaw and chief,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_8:0.9500:Tales wonder-fraught and staggering belief ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_9:0.9750:Of social memories, gratefully restored
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_10:1.0000:In rare re-unions round the festive board ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_11:1.0000:Of each and all, the Muse would gladly sing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_12:1.0000:But Time speeds onward with resistless wing ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_14:1.0000:The grateful Muse, the parting hand extends.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_15:1.0000:Tour warm assurance, overcame her fear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0184_18:0.9750:Remember kindly, and forgive the rest.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_5:1.0000:His reason vaunting, yet commit to chance ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_6:1.0000:Why Hope paints pictures for minds immature
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_7:1.0000:Which manly learnings change not, but obscure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_8:0.9750:In fainter light leaves youth's ideals to men,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_9:0.9750:To mock what now is, with what might have been ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_11:1.0000:In sunshine cowards, heroes in the storm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_12:0.9750:Self-torturing, with a vague, fictitious harm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_13:1.0000:While life's broad sea is mirrored in a calm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_14:1.0000:Rising with strength from morbid fancy's threat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_15:1.0000:As serious dangers compass and beset ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_16:1.0000:Why words by moral costumers are made
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_17:1.0000:Dark dominos in life's grand masquerade,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_18:1.0000:Not all concealing, yet a full disguise ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_19:1.0000:Why single names form constant compromise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_22:0.9500:By which the world commends them when they
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_24:0.9500:Whilst "Generous," "Noble," "Liberal" and "Just"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0185_25:1.0000:Are terms the poor pass to the rich, on trust,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_1:0.9750:With " Enterprise," the letter-shield of lust,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_2:1.0000:And " Charity," incarnate in a crust !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_3:0.9500:Why sweet content deserts the Monarch's throne,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_4:0.9750:And claims the peasant's cottage as her own ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_5:0.9750:Why harmony of thought is frequent found
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_6:1.0000:Amid the discords of contentious sound ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_7:1.0000:Why calms, proverbial, coming storms presage,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_8:1.0000:And are but omens of a day of rage,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_9:1.0000:At present peace foreshadowing a curse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_10:1.0000:Which Envies iii the deeps of stillness nurse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_11:0.9750:Why Sciences pretentiously exact,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_12:1.0000:Place " new discoveries " on the roll of fact,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_13:0.9750:Which soon their venerated being give,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_16:1.0000:And point in focus what they contradict ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_17:1.0000:Why great inventions follow in the wake,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_18:0.9750:And often seem the creatures of mistake ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_19:1.0000:Why relished sin adopts the mode and time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_21:0.9750:Why sin's last patent notches the degree
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_22:1.0000:At which the average moral stand must be ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_23:1.0000:Why failure in the marts of trade is less
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_24:1.0000:A synonym for ruin than success ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_25:0.9750:Why he who seeks peremptory relief
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0186_26:0.9750:Upon the highway may be held a thief,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_1:0.9750:Whilst he who plunders from the public vaults
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_2:1.0000:Is merely weak, and amiable in faults ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_3:0.9750:Why the sage public o'er a fancy frets
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_4:1.0000:While Christian churches dance away their debts ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_5:1.0000:Why creedless wits, who flatulently sneer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_6:1.0000:At every dogma which the mass revere,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_7:1.0000:Attain to fame upon the false pretense
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_8:1.0000:Of doing honor to man's common sense !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_9:0.9750:These daily mysteries in the mighty plan
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_11:0.9750:These lighter, modern marvels, which, perchance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_12:0.9500:Are sample offspring of strange circumstance ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_13:1.0000:These contrasts, inconsistencies and frauds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_14:0.9750:Hypocrisy induces, or applauds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_15:0.9750:Contribute in a ratio and concert
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_16:1.0000:To fashion evil we may not avert ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_17:1.0000:Produce conditions in our social state
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_18:1.0000:Philosophies explain not, nor abate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_19:0.9750:Uncertain render temporal needs and gains,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_20:0.9750:Debauch our comfort and increase our pains ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_21:1.0000:Confusion cast where purposes are just,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_22:1.0000:And cripple courage with a hard distrust ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_23:1.0000:The private and the public prospects shroud
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_24:1.0000:With almost an impenetrable cloud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_25:1.0000:The veil which hides the future from our sight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0187_26:1.0000:Prefix with gloom and deepen into night ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_1:0.9750:Add to the blindness nature's laws decree
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_2:1.0000:A sad misgiving that the worst will be.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_3:1.0000:A Faith divine may raise the mind serene
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_4:1.0000:Above the trials of this earthly scene ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_5:1.0000:A heavenly Hope may bring the soul repose
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_6:1.0000:Amid the sternest of our mortal woes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_7:1.0000:And build a patience that will bravely bear
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_8:0.9750:The ills of time, the promptings of despair.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_9:0.9750:Yet learn we not from that same gracious Book
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_10:0.9750:Within whose pages saints devoutly look
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_11:0.9750:To find this glorious Faith and Hope revealed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_13:1.0000:With this inscription, With the race began
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_15:1.0000:At once to aid the spirit in its strife
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_16:1.0000:For noblest elements in human life,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_17:1.0000:And all the energies of soul incite
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_18:1.0000:To study and exemplify the EIGHT ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_20:0.9500:Confirm and nurture honest faith with fruit ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_21:0.9500:Interpret into acts, enlarge the scope
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0188_22:1.0000:And purify the properties of hope ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_6:0.9750:ODD-FELLOWSHIP in wisdom was designed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_7:1.0000:With no less purpose did our fathers build
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_8:1.0000:This sacred Order ; in whose terms fulfilled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_9:1.0000:Themselves *and their true children have been
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_11:1.0000:Their memory, immortal, stands confest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_12:0.9750:Well worthy of the reverence we pay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_13:1.0000:In every ceremonial act to-day.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_14:0.9750:Our honored Fathers ! let no one presume
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_15:1.0000:To think by words he can their names illume.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_16:1.0000:What of their fitting eulogy we claim
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_17:1.0000:Has not been written in the Order's fame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_19:0.9750:'Tis blazoned elsewhere, in the realms of light.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_21:0.9500:Their work, unwritten here, has glorious place :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_22:0.9500:A work obedient to the Order's laws,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_23:1.0000:Or instigated in its noble cause ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_24:1.0000:A work of Friendship, so divinely odd,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0189_25:1.0000:Its record the prerogative of God !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_2:1.0000:Shall be proclaimed in sweet, celestial rhyme !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_4:1.0000:The culture of the arts that civilize.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_5:1.0000:"We pride ourselves that we were haply born
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_6:1.0000:Where science strides and literatures adorn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_8:1.0000:The popular motives are condensed in steam.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_9:1.0000:Each fresh advancement in mechanic skill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_10:1.0000:Inflames conceit and magnifies the will.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_11:1.0000:Once fairly harnessed, genius can prepare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0190_12:1.0000:New uses for the elements in air

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_1:0.9500:Riches increasing at enormous rate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_2:1.0000:And swiftly swelling such an aggregate
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_3:1.0000:That, within reason, it must surely seem
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_4:1.0000:To far outstrip the miser's wildest dream.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_5:1.0000:We know, of late, the precious ores are found
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_6:0.9750:In such profusion as affords no ground
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_7:1.0000:For accurate reckoning of prospective yield ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_16:1.0000:The poor to fortune regularly ride ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_17:1.0000:Since any knave may pelt his dupe with rocks,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_18:1.0000:Then thrust his swollen feet in public stocks.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_19:1.0000:Wo boast the glory of our common schools ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_20:0.9500:With great " improvements " made by modern
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_22:0.9750:Where the stout implements which were in vogue
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_23:1.0000:As fit correctives for a truant rogue,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_24:1.0000:To spur the slothful, break the stubborn will,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0191_25:1.0000:And measured lessons thoroughly instill,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_11:1.0000:But every purpose of the ox or tree.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_13:0.9750:On sight, suggestions of a mortal sting,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_16:1.0000:We boast a cheap, efficient, speedy mode
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_17:1.0000:Of granting justice through a civil code :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_18:1.0000:Whose terms provide that suitors, who may feel
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_19:1.0000:Aggrieved at first decisions, can appeal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_20:1.0000:To grand tribunals, where each concrete case
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_21:1.0000:Is aptly furnished with an abstract face ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_22:1.0000:Where facts are " features," and the counsel's whims
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_23:0.9750:Concerning cognate issues are the "limbs."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_24:0.9750:Where lawyers like experienced miners fight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0192_25:1.0000:For claims which merely have the color, Eight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_1:0.9750:Where skillful logic is employed to show
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_2:1.0000:The various errors of the court below ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_3:1.0000:And history, like a criminal arraigned

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_9:0.9500:Cheap is the mode ! 'Twas Solomon's advice :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_10:1.0000:My son, get wisdom at whatever price.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_11:1.0000:Efficient ! Since it thoroughly conveys
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_12:1.0000:Essential knowledge in eccentric ways,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_13:1.0000:Aiding the mind by each peculiar turn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_14:1.0000:To hold the lesson it deserved to learn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_15:1.0000:And speedy ! When the value and amount
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_16:1.0000:Of wisdom gained is taken in account.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_17:1.0000:We boast a penal code ; which seems to shed

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_21:1.0000:His dungeon door barred gently, on a catch,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_22:0.9750:Till " justice " nimbly lifts the legal lache !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_23:0.9750:With conscious pity are our minds imbued
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0193_24:1.0000:For those who lived when social laws were crude,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_2:1.0000:Outspoken pride at our advancing state,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_3:0.9750:In all that make convenience, comfort, ease,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_4:1.0000:Save time and labor, or the senses please.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_5:1.0000:A healthy sentiment of pride is part
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_6:1.0000:Of all appreciative sense of Art ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_7:1.0000:And great discoveries in themselves denote
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_8:1.0000:To-day's advantage which they must promote,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_9:1.0000:Compelling us with flattery to contrast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_10:1.0000:The present progress with the ignorant past.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_11:1.0000:Our education, and a force inborn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_12:0.9750:Tempt us to see primeval times with scorn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_13:0.9750:And with an ever ready reverence bow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_14:1.0000:Before the genius of Imperial Now !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_15:1.0000:Thus do we fail to keep in prudent mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_16:1.0000:Favors and burdens are alike assigned ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_17:1.0000:Thus do we fail to practically own,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_18:1.0000:With social progress social cares have grown ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_19:0.9750:Ignore, or equally at fault forget,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_20:1.0000:As our advantage, so our civil debt ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_21:1.0000:As the complexities of life increase,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0194_22:0.9750:So must man's labor for the public peace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_3:0.9500:gate
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_7:0.9500:Anarchial dangers from mere, sordid enterprise.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_10:0.9750:Seems to have almost made their beauteous work
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_12:0.9500:And following history, thro' a lengthened lapse of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_16:1.0000:While manual outlines we attempt to sing ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_17:1.0000:Now, while we celebrate a natal morn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_18:1.0000:And larger Opportunities are born ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_19:1.0000:Now, when our banner proudly is unfurled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_20:0.9750:And we avow our precepts to the world.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_21:0.9750:Come, Stranger ! ere ye seek a closer name,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0195_22:0.9750:Lend audience to the doctrines we proclaim :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_2:1.0000:And near the sands of th' inevitable shore ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_4:0.9500:To every man his own peculiar fate :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_5:0.9500:With following hours contrasting thought and deed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_6:0.9750:With years all barren, and with moments great.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_7:1.0000:Full soon we learn a law of equal birth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_8:1.0000:To which, without incongruous act, we give
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_9:0.9750:A holier homage in the scenes of earth :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_10:1.0000:Unto himself no man can truly live.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_12:0.9500:Still from our practice it remains concealed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_13:1.0000:Till blessed sorrow makes our wants appear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_14:1.0000:And all adapted uses are revealed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_15:1.0000:The general lessons gathered 'mid the din
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_16:1.0000:Of worldly conflict, triumph or defeat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_17:1.0000:Provoke the " Delphic Oracle within,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_18:1.0000:To call the mind to Fellowship's Retreat.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_19:1.0000:Not to the hut of hermit or recluse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_20:0.9500:Where misanthropic sentiments are nursed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_21:0.9500:Not to retirements where the mean excuse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0196_22:1.0000:For selfish ease is Avarice's sated 1 hirst :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_1:0.9750:But to the cloistered company of those
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_2:1.0000:Whose purpose is to thoroughly equip
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_3:1.0000:Good soldiers for the battles 'gainst life's woes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_4:1.0000:That test the champions of Odd-Fellowship.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_5:1.0000:Here, man is separated from the world ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_6:1.0000:No longer burdened with fictitious cares ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_7:1.0000:No more within Dissension's eddies whirled ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_8:1.0000:No longer threatened by Ambition's snares.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_9:1.0000:Here, Vice no more is potent to allure ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_14:1.0000:sway,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_15:1.0000:Their mild dominion gloriously assert :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_16:0.9500:Thy promise all their precepts to obey
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_17:1.0000:Insures the benediction they concert.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_19:1.0000:The weary mind with heavenly balm of Peace ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_20:0.9500:Assuage with sympathy the heart's distress,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_21:1.0000:For sorest trouble give or point release.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0197_22:0.9750:Should any round this sacred altar bow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_1:0.9500:Who will not follow the initiate's vow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_4:1.0000:Where on the recreant falls a fearful ban ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_5:0.9750:Canst thou a talismanic secret keep ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_6:1.0000:Then show the fortitude becomes a man !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_7:1.0000:Alas for man ! In darkness and in chains,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_8:0.9750:In moral blindness and by passions bound :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_9:0.9750:A mournful spectacle where folly reigns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_10:1.0000:And wisdom's voice is an unheeded sound.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_11:1.0000:There is a time most fitting to confess
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_12:1.0000:When stern ordeal of trial is at hand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_13:1.0000:The grievous errors which the mind oppress,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_14:1.0000:And give to conscience sceptres of command.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_15:1.0000:O ! sad remembrances of wrong, awake !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_16:1.0000:Now is the hour, repenting, to reveal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_17:1.0000:The sins which by their recollection break
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_18:1.0000:From retrospect the dark, funereal seal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_19:0.9750:If ever thou hast mean advantage gained ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_20:0.9750:O'er-reached thy fellow with a plann'd deceit,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_21:0.9750:His honor blasted while in friendship feigned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0198_22:1.0000:His fortune ruined by a studied cheat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_2:1.0000:Long prayers in public an availing cloak
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_3:1.0000:Against that knowledge thou wer't well afraid
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_5:0.9750:If thou hast caused the orphan's tears to flow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_6:1.0000:Hast sought his golden portion to purloin ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_7:0.9750:And then, a savoring charity to show,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_8:1.0000:Heaped shallow saucers with the smallest coin ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_9:0.9750:O ! answer truly, at thy soul's expense !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_10:1.0000:Confess, if guilty, and at once retire :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_11:1.0000:For else than innocent of grave offence
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_12:0.9750:Thou mayst not bide the dreadful track of fire !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_13:1.0000:Life's painful end life's duties best can teach.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_14:1.0000:Emblems of mortal struggling and of death
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_15:1.0000:The heart not lost to human hope must reach,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_16:0.9500:And touch the conscience with compunctious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_17:0.9500:breath.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_18:0.9750:He who is fit and able to endure
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_19:1.0000:The early discipline of bonds and night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_20:1.0000:Deserves for recompensing to procure
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_21:1.0000:The fullest liberty and clearest light.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_22:1.0000:In this true Light may Brothers ever walk ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0199_23:1.0000:This Liberty without abuse enjoy.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_1:0.9500:May no false signals tempt them but to mock,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_2:0.9750:No sensual charms solicit and destroy.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_3:1.0000:Hail ! master workmen, who to-day unite
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_4:1.0000:In services of dedicating power.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_6:1.0000:And consecrate the building and the hour.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_7:1.0000:May the grand invocations which ye raise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_8:1.0000:The gracious favor of our God obtain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_9:1.0000:And may your choral symphonies of praise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_11:1.0000:From out the bustle of the crowded street,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_12:1.0000:From out the tumult of the business mart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_13:1.0000:May yonder house be our beloved retreat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_14:1.0000:The home we cherish with the mind and heart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0200_15:1.0000:Within its walls may harmony abound ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0201_5:1.0000:To constant practice in that heavenly grace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0201_7:0.9500:This work, a Temple of enduring LOVE ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0201_8:1.0000:And typify our kindled hearts' desires

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0204_19:0.9500:Its queer effects the reverend man could hardly have

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0205_14:0.9500:His heart began to palpitate ; a rapturous thrill went
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0205_16:0.9500:And from their lips, as stood the pair upon the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_5:0.9500:And so I come ; and just to take some vengeance on
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_6:0.9500:my friend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_7:0.9750:I tell you the whole story, from beginning unto
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_9:0.9500:You now perceive precisely, what the Doctor was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_10:0.9750:about
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_15:0.9500:We may as well own up at once that he's a first rate
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_16:0.9750:fellow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_17:0.9750:He plies his arduous calling with a wondrous skill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_18:0.9750:and vigor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_19:1.0000:And keeps a big establishment, but keeps a heart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_21:0.9750:And once or twice in every year, as sure as the re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0212_23:1.0000:Of planets through their giddy paths, the festal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_2:0.9500:who go there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_6:0.9750:And troops of friends around him, and pleasing hopes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_10:0.9500:With softened, radiant glory shine upon his evening
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_15:0.9750:And of that favor'd number, may all here present
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_16:0.9500:be;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0213_17:0.9750:And when he does this thing again, may we be here
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_4:0.9750:NECESSITY, that stems all law
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_5:1.0000:And brooks of no delay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_6:1.0000:Engulphed the gentle friend I saw
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_8:1.0000:His modest way, his honest smile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_9:0.9750:His 'customed accents bland,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_10:0.9750:Had given place to stoutest style
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_11:1.0000:Of summons and command.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_12:1.0000:It was the old, old tale of woe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_14:1.0000:That will not tolerate a " No ",
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_15:1.0000:'Gainst that committee-man.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_16:0.9750:When bureau stars beguile, betray,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0214_18:1.0000:Who else must save from blank dismay

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_8:1.0000:For all he can't and can ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_9:1.0000:He is a lecturer, poet, saint,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_10:1.0000:To that committee-man.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_11:0.9750:Such was the basis of salute
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_12:1.0000:And orders to attend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_13:1.0000:Which brought me here without dispute,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_14:0.9750:Obedient to my friend.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_15:0.9750:In choosing a topic, why need I be driven ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_16:1.0000:The goddess of rhyming was specially shriven.

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_19:1.0000:So, out from your Eden, old Adam of kin !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0215_20:0.9750:Before you e'er fell in the pitfalls of sin ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0216_7:1.0000:And your bones benedictive of pallets of straw.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0216_8:0.9500:Thy paradise dwelling and service should teach
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0216_15:1.0000:The treble and the screech on wings, the roar upon

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0227_10:0.9750:Words foi the hundreds ! Blessed few ; in Honor's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0228_3:1.0000:I make avowal consonant with most congenial spell-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0228_5:0.9750:Should I permit my rhyming muse to longer test
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0228_7:1.0000:I might reduce a note of praise to feeble semi-qua-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0228_9:0.9750:So while there's merit in the act, I'll make a timely

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0228_11:0.9750:That when 'tis said, " it was not much," the phrase

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_6:1.0000:While I describe the wondrous sights
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_7:1.0000:I see upon the sea.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_8:0.9750:Old Ocean is a heavy swell ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_9:1.0000:A deep old salt, for that ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_10:1.0000:You'll find your error, if at first
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_11:1.0000:You take him for a flat.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_12:1.0000:No rower can withstand his roar ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_13:1.0000:For blows he's ever ready ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_14:1.0000:And whoso keeps his company,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_15:0.9750:Is apt to get unsteady.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_16:1.0000:He brags what flags wave o'er his waves ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_17:0.9750:He boasts his ships are whalers ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_18:1.0000:With gales regales us, just to show
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_19:1.0000:How he assails the sailors.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_20:0.9750:Ah me ! I'm six days out from shore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0229_21:1.0000:A cleaned-out, luckless rover ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_1:0.9750:Another six-days cruise ahead ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_2:0.9750:And so> I'm half-seas-over.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_3:1.0000:I feel so " cabin'd, cribbed, confined,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_4:0.9750:I scarce can draw my breath ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_5:1.0000:There's no more comfort in my berth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_6:1.0000:Than if it were my death.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_7:1.0000:I go upon the upper deck
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_8:1.0000:They call " the hurricane ; "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_9:1.0000:I spy a seat hard by, I strive
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_10:1.0000:With all my might to gain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_11:0.9750:The passage thither seems up hill ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_12:1.0000:I'm just a'going to soar ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_13:1.0000:When lo ! there comes a sudden lurch,-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_14:1.0000:I'm sprawling on the floor !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_15:1.0000:With stern resolve I seek the stern,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_16:1.0000:The ship's in mad carouse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_17:1.0000:The masts as to their master nod,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_18:1.0000:The bow is making bows.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_19:0.9750:The smoke-stack is exceeding sick,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_20:1.0000:It vomits forth a cloud ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_21:1.0000:A deathly pallor seems to sit
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0230_22:0.9750:On every sail and shroud.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_1:0.9750:I look down in the engine room ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_2:1.0000:The struggle there is fine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_3:1.0000:The old ship's stomach seems disturbed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_4:1.0000:Almost as bad as mine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_5:1.0000:An afterthought conducts me aft,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_6:1.0000:How very queer I feel !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_7:1.0000:The things go dancing round me so,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_8:1.0000:My brain begins to reel.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_9:1.0000:Then comes the strange sensation on,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_10:1.0000:The like you never knew ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_11:1.0000:There's nothing for it, but to run,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_12:0.9750:Eugh ! Eugh ! ! E-e-u-g-h ! ! !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_13:1.0000:O grim old Neptune ! once release
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_14:1.0000:Your precious hold on me ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0231_15:1.0000:And you may play your pranks at will,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0232_18:0.9500:Mark the firm resolve that dareth both to do, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0232_19:0.9750:die.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0232_21:0.9500:While the shells are shrieking madly overhead ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0232_23:1.0000:See the rebel cannon, spouting leaden rain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_4:0.9500:With redoubled fury vexes earth and sky,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_5:0.9750:As our glorious banner greets the foeman's eye.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_6:1.0000:Gallantly before us, in the thrilling scene,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_7:0.9500:March the storming party, with musket and fascine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_19:0.9750:In an instant stricken, on the field is lying !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_21:1.0000:Strive to gain the ramparts, but, alas ! in vain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_22:1.0000:From those fatal ramparts, looming still afar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0233_23:0.9750:How the foe, exultant, hurl the bolts of war !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_4:0.9500:Of that proud battalion, fresh-lipped men and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_5:0.9750:brave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_13:1.0000:Softly soon the Day-King sinks unto his rest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_14:1.0000:And the grateful twilight deepens in the west.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_18:0.9500:treat.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0234_19:0.9750:Lo ! what scenes confront them, as they rearward
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0235_4:1.0000:Ever let their actions be preserved in story,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_8:0.9500:its way ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_14:0.9750:As, each revolving year, we greet its annual re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_15:0.9500:turn!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_16:0.9750:Our country ! with what pride we trace her onward,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_18:1.0000:Since first our grandsires hailed the dawn of Inde-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0236_20:1.0000:In conflict born, in faith sustained, baptized in blood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_2:0.9750:last to be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_3:0.9750:An empire whose dominion stretched from sea across
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_5:0.9500:Beneath her banner, science, art, and each fair en-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_7:0.9500:Thrived, like exhuberant fruits, beneath the most
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_9:0.9750:Here Justice held her scales aloft, and with benig-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_11:0.9500:Religion, with her mitred front, o'erlooked the glad-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_15:0.9500:As on some sign of healing by some modern Moses
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_16:1.0000:raised ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_17:0.9500:And unto it with joyful hope, and with a faith sub-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_20:1.0000:shore and clime.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_22:0.9750:thought nor dreamed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0237_23:0.9750:How much of discord lay concealed, where all so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_3:0.9500:As dare profane the citadel where all our hopes re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_5:1.0000:But times have changed ; this very scene reminds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_9:0.9500:earned scar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_10:0.9750:Tell that the nation writhes beneath the crimson
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_11:0.9500:foot of war !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_12:0.9750:But, God be praised, the hour hath shown, that when,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_14:0.9500:Heaven oped its gates to greet our sires, true valor
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_16:0.9750:O, let our faith and hope grow strong, as in our ranks
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_17:0.9750:to-day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_18:0.9500:We recognize the sons of sires, as brave, as true, as
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_20:0.9750:And now, as comes the season round, when every
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_21:0.9500:bosom glows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0238_22:0.9750:Afresh with love of country, and with wrath against
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0239_3:1.0000:The contest never to give o'er, nor sheathe the right-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0239_4:0.9500:eous sword,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0239_7:1.0000:Our Flag shall spread its ample folds, unchallenged,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0239_9:1.0000:And everywhere, the wide world round, that glori-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0239_11:0.9750:In very deed, and very truth, the Ensign of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_2:1.0000:SISTER ! we mourn with ceaseless grief tliy going,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_3:0.9500:Since thou hast left us ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_9:0.9500:Thou wast, but art not here forever more ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_10:1.0000:Such thy brief story ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_11:0.9750:Thy life was bright and joyous, but 'tis o'er ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_12:0.9500:Thou hast gone seeking dear ones gone before,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_13:1.0000:And from the slopes of that celestial shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_14:1.0000:Hast risen to glory.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_15:0.9750:Say, in those upper mansions, didst thou meet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_17:0.9500:And in the first bright throng that came to greet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_18:0.9750:And brought thee glad embrace, swift-winged and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_20:0.9500:Was there not that dear face, serene and sweet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_21:0.9500:Our sainted mother's ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_22:0.9750:Oh ! I do seem to see new joy in Heaven,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0240_23:1.0000:As she who bore thee
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_2:0.9750:Safe at the goal towards which it well had striven,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_3:1.0000:And, joyous in this child-companion given,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_4:1.0000:Bent smiling o'er thee ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_5:0.9750:And to the Father, on His white throne seated,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_6:0.9500:And to the Son,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_8:1.0000:Glad hyinns of praises, nor in vain entreated
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_9:1.0000:Welcome to thee, O rapturously greeted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_11:0.9750:There, as eternal cycles roll away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_12:0.9750:Thou art at rest.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_13:1.0000:Around, the everlasting sunbeams play ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_14:1.0000:Through golden streets, through sweet fields, thou
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_18:1.0000:Yet e'en from Heaven's ecstatic joys, I know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_19:0.9750:Thou wouldst look down,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_20:1.0000:And gaze in fondness upon friends below,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_21:0.9500:And fain wouldst woo them from this world of woe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0241_22:0.9500:And higher joys portray, and fain wouldst show
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_1:0.9750:But, oh, how swift the years will wing their flight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_2:0.9500:In thy esteem !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_4:0.9500:Comes, whispering of the morn, or else with blight ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_6:0.9500:Pass like a dream !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_7:1.0000:And, shortly, all the friends and kindred known
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_8:0.9500:On earth to thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_9:0.9500:Must cross the stream which thou hast crossed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_12:1.0000:And, in its bliss, or terrors, must be shown
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_14:0.9750:Spirit departed unto realms above,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_19:0.9500:But lead me thither !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0242_20:1.0000:And, haply, He who lives to intercede
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_1:0.9750:Yet not to gain it, when I know what guest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_2:0.9500:Inhabits there ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_4:0.9500:What greater woe wherewith to be oppressed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_5:0.9750:What greater grief, or sorrow, or unrest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_7:0.9750:Dear sister ! Earth is less since thou hast died,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_8:0.9500:And Heaven is more.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_9:0.9750:From Heaven look down and be my constant guide.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_10:0.9500:So may I 'scape the snares of sin and pride,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_11:0.9750:And reach at last, beyond Death's gloomy tide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_13:0.9750:There, as the tireless centuries come and go,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_14:1.0000:No fate shall sever ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_15:1.0000:Supernal joys shall have perpetual flow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_16:1.0000:Loved ones of old shall throng with hearts aglow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0243_17:0.9750:And bid us taste of pleasures, we shall know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_3:0.9500:I STOOD within the consecrated ground,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_14:1.0000:Within the period of a few brief years.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_16:0.9500:Was here laid low with many sighs and tears !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_17:1.0000:Yet, day by day, upon our careless ears
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_18:1.0000:Fall sad the tones of the funereal bell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_19:0.9750:As, here and there, some fated mortal hears,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_20:0.9500:Sounding for him, th' inexorable knell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0244_24:1.0000:And for its tenant yawns another tomb,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_2:0.9500:And new-wreathed flowers exhale their sweet per-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_3:0.9750:fume
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_10:0.9500:'Tis a fine impulse worthy of a race,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_11:0.9750:The foremost, doubtless, of the sons of earth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_12:1.0000:The habitations of the dead to grace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_13:0.9750:With fitting tributes to departed worth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_14:0.9500:How meet that one who had a common birth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_15:0.9750:With me ; whose youth ran parallel with mine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_16:1.0000:Who sat beside the same paternal hearth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_17:1.0000:When called at last his being to resign,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_21:0.9750:Yes, honored be the instinct which incites
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_22:0.9500:To decoration of the sacred spot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0245_23:0.9750:Where the dead rest, with something which in-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_4:0.9750:But o'er thy ashes, the memorial stone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_5:1.0000:Some place to thee in memory shall allot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_6:1.0000:Record a life in which some virtues shone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_10:0.9750:On death, and scenes which its approach attend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_11:0.9750:To see attractions multiplied and spread
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_12:1.0000:Around each tomb by some surviving friend.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_13:0.9500:'Tis sweet to feel that, when one's life shall end,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_14:0.9750:He shall not sleep within a nameless grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_15:1.0000:But o'er him some inscription shall defend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_19:0.9500:And there's incentive in the pleasing thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_20:1.0000:That whatsoever hath been grandly done,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_21:1.0000:In panegyric letters may be wrought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0246_22:1.0000:Upon the shaft, or monumental stone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_1:0.9500:Who, in mankind's affection, held a throne ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_6:0.9750:Against the havoc and the waste of time ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_7:0.9750:They serve a purpose, but decay and fall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_8:1.0000:Ere they who built scarce reach th' eternal clime.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_9:0.9750:Some living truth disclosed some deed sublime
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_10:1.0000:These be the monuments that shall endure.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_12:0.9750:Give each a place in history secure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_13:0.9500:Beneath Fame's temple-dome, a habitation sure.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_15:0.9500:At God's commandment, lifted up his face ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_16:1.0000:So passed forever out from human sight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_17:1.0000:And no man knoweth of his burial-place.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_18:0.9750:Yet not till men have lost the power to trace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_19:1.0000:In holy writ, the record blazoned there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_20:1.0000:Shall he, the leader of a chosen race,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_21:1.0000:The homage of the ages fail to share,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0247_22:1.0000:Or crowns of everlasting splendor cease to wear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_3:1.0000:Our cemeteries make a vast display.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_4:1.0000:Like living cities, cities of the dead
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_5:1.0000:What sort of folk inhabit there, betray.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_6:1.0000:The architecture of the present day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_7:0.9750:The ancient models setting all at nought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_15:0.9750:Against time's ravages, the best defence,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_16:0.9750:And shun, of all things, vulgar, base pretense.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_17:1.0000:Did he die rich ? be modest, ne'ertheless,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_18:1.0000:Nor strain to typify his opulence
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_19:1.0000:By something that shall only make men guess
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_23:0.9750:Their costly tributes to great Washington ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0248_24:0.9500:Or, lavish of expense, adorn and gild
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_2:1.0000:Soldier or sage, or patriot, whose life done,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_4:0.9750:Within whose midst his grand career was run ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_5:0.9500:Who, o'er his dust, or in the classic hall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_6:0.9750:Or in the market-place, his sculptur'd form install.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_8:1.0000:But when old Jones, whoso riches were amassed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_9:1.0000:In manufactures, or in merchandise ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_10:0.9750:In prosperous venture, or some signal cast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_11:1.0000:Of fortune, pays stern Nature's debt, and dies,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_12:0.9750:And wills that o'er his ashes there shall rise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_13:1.0000:The most imposing of memorial stones,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_14:1.0000:His name, forsooth, to thus immortalize ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_15:0.9750:I really can but think that Mr. Jones
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_16:0.9500:Is paying overdue respect unto his bones.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_18:0.9750:And mark the folly of the vast outlay !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_19:1.0000:This man would fain perpetuate his name ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_20:0.9750:But, ah ! how soon his fabric will decay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_21:0.9500:And time will mock his weak, pretentious claim.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_22:0.9500:Wealth can find better shifts to purchase fame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_23:1.0000:Jones spent a fortune ; he might have endowed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0249_24:1.0000:A charity or college with the same,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_7:0.9750:On charities bestowed a zealous care.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_8:0.9500:The tomb that shrines him is a plain affair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_9:0.9500:And yet his name on many a structure shines,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_10:0.9750:Goes linked with benefactions here and there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_11:0.9500:And, until Time his sovereignty resigns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_12:1.0000:On Fame's bright scroll shall be inscribed in living
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_16:0.9750:I'd have no costly pile above my head ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_17:1.0000:But I would be remembered, if at all,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_18:1.0000:For something nobly done, or fitly said.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_19:1.0000:But, should I join the multitudinous dead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_20:0.9750:Who leave no footprints on Time's treacherous
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0250_23:0.9500:Sometimes a tear beside the spot where stands
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_3:1.0000:Began to cast his shadows, dark and long ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_4:0.9750:And so, with one accord, were quickly done
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_5:1.0000:The day, my stroll, my reverie, and my song. .
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_6:0.9750:To the near city I made haste along,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_7:1.0000:Through avenues proud, and bustling thorough-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_9:0.9750:And once more mingling with the busy throng,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0251_10:0.9750:Ah, me ! how soon life's round of paltry cares,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_4:1.0000:No MORE to chronicle fraternal wars ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_5:0.9750:No longer hand-maid of the furious Mars ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_6:0.9750:No more to beckon to a soldier's grave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_7:1.0000:The youthful warrior, the heroic brave ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_8:1.0000:No more with classic tread and ireful mien,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_16:0.9750:And fierce the storm, whose pent-up wrath broke
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_19:1.0000:When the defiant flag was first unfurled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_20:1.0000:And civil war's hot thunderbolts were hurled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_21:1.0000:Waking the echoes of the startled world.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_22:0.9750:Sad was the day, and evil was the hour,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0252_23:0.9750:When Reason left her throne and lost her power ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_5:0.9500:Too glad this common heritage to mar
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_6:0.9750:"\Yith all the havoc of tremendous war,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_7:0.9750:And drown the sacred ties of brotherhood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_8:0.9750:In swollen rivers of fraternal blood !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_9:1.0000:It was to be ; the God who rules above,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_10:1.0000:Alike the God of justice, as of love,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_11:0.9750:Doubt not, was witness with omniscient eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_12:0.9750:Of all the scene ; and from His throne on high,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_13:0.9750:Beheld what man saw not, nor yet foresees,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_15:0.9500:Nay, e'en to us, of finite, feeble sense,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_17:0.9750:And all the sacrifice of toil and blood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_18:1.0000:Seems cheap in prospect of the coming good.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_19:1.0000:Men die, but nations live, whose men are great,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_20:1.0000:Arid fit to found and regulate a state ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_21:1.0000:And nations are the mighty instruments,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_22:1.0000:Beneath the wondrous rule of Providence,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_23:0.9750:Wherewith to hasten that consummate end,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_24:1.0000:To which all time's events and changes tend ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_25:1.0000:And whoso with a pious trust essays
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0253_26:1.0000:To give his nation power and length of days ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_1:1.0000:To make her nobler, and of higher worth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_2:0.9750:Among the thrones and kingdoms of the earth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_3:0.9750:Fulfills a mission ; and may lay him down
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_4:0.9750:Where death o'ertakes him ; he hath won a crown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_6:1.0000:That far-off grave 'neath the magnolia tree,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_17:1.0000:A hero, died, who might have lived instead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_18:1.0000:To die, a riddance, in an old man's bed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_22:0.9500:Where the James rolls his deep, historic tide,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0254_23:1.0000:Our hearts go out and up to you to-day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_2:1.0000:On history's page we have often read
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_3:1.0000:Of the wondrous deeds of those,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_4:1.0000:Who at famed Thermopylae fought and fell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_5:1.0000:And at Marathon struggled long and well,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_6:1.0000:Whose story the grand old writers tell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_7:1.0000:In immortal verse and prose.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_8:1.0000:And we thought that the age was forever past,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_9:1.0000:When spirits so noble could still bo cast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_10:1.0000:In a like heroic mould ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_11:1.0000:And we did not dream that here and there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_12:1.0000:Each in his little round of care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_13:1.0000:Breathing with us the common air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_14:1.0000:Were youths, whose courage to do and dare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_15:0.9500:Occasion might unfold.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_16:1.0000:We have read in old books, of classic ground,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_17:1.0000:And have longed to visit and linger round
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_18:1.0000:As pilgrims round a shrine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_19:1.0000:Each famous spot, where, in days gone by,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_20:0.9750:Proud Greek met Greek with a dauntless eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_21:1.0000:In haughty contempt of death, to die,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_22:1.0000:With an impulse that seemed divine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_23:1.0000:But no longer we need to gaze afar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_24:0.9750:To where the grim-visaged god of war
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0255_25:1.0000:Hath stalked with ponderous tread.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_1:1.0000:On the hither side of the ocean foam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_2:1.0000:Where the young Columbia hath her home,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_3:0.9750:Sacred indeed hath the soil become,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_6:0.9500:As the long line moves from East to West,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_7:1.0000:In procession vast and grand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_8:1.0000:Of pilgrims from far beyond the sea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_9:1.0000:In this favored home of the brave and free,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_10:1.0000:By the graves of martyrs for Liberty,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_11:1.0000:In reverent awe to stand !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_12:0.9750:Inscribed on a new-built Arch of Fame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_13:1.0000:Shall stand forever each honored name
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_14:1.0000:Of that unselfish throng ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_15:1.0000:And the unborn millions shall be taught,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_16:1.0000:What deeds sublime these heroes wrought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_17:1.0000:And how with patriot zeal they fought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_18:1.0000:And conquered a giant wrong.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_19:1.0000:And of that proud Arch, the white keystone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_20:0.9750:Shall bear the shining name of one,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_21:1.0000:Whose death was the august crown
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_22:1.0000:Of the sacrifices a nation gave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_23:1.0000:In a perilous hour, its life to save ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0256_24:0.9500:Sleep well, great Chief, in thy hallowed grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_2:1.0000:The dastard blow that struck thee dead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_3:1.0000:New lustre on thy record shed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_4:1.0000:And wrought thee good, where ill was meant.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_5:1.0000:Thou hadst the plenitude of fame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_6:1.0000:And heart of friend and whilom foe ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_7:1.0000:There seemed no higher boon below,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_8:1.0000:Or short of Heaven, for thee to claim.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_9:0.9750:So all-symmetric thy career,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_10:1.0000:To live, was but to jeopardize ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_11:1.0000:For oft would busy envy rise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_12:1.0000:And seek excuse to carp and sneer.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_13:0.9500:So, like a fully ripened sheaf,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_14:0.9500:The reaper, Death, at God's command,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_15:1.0000:Did cut thee down with furtive hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_16:1.0000:And all the world was plunged in grief.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_17:1.0000:O, how the nation wept for thee !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_18:1.0000:While fast in sympathetic flow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_19:1.0000:Fell stranger tears, and tones of woe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_20:1.0000:Came wafted o'er the sobbing sea.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_21:0.9500:With calmer eyes we now discern,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_22:1.0000:In this event, the hand of God.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_23:1.0000:We place thy ashes 'neath the sod,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0257_24:1.0000:And shrine thy deeds in history's urn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_1:0.9750:Full at the zenith stood thy sun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_2:0.9750:Betokening grateful afternoon ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_3:1.0000:Yet none shall deem inopportune
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_4:0.9750:That swift eclipse ; thy work was done !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_5:0.9750:Now let us turn the picture round, and view the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_11:0.9750:lives.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_14:1.0000:The mightiest war that ever yet was waged beneath
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_15:0.9750:the sun ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_17:0.9500:year,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_18:0.9750:Still found within our anxious hearts alternate hope
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0258_20:1.0000:But, God be praised, the scene is changed ; the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_3:0.9750:And Peace o'er all the fair expanse resumes her glad
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_5:0.9750:Our " erring sisters " have come back, at least
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_6:0.9500:they say they're coming ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_7:0.9750:The busy wheels of enterprise on every side are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_9:0.9750:The boys come home to breathe the northern air so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_13:0.9750:The contrabands are freemen all ; it seems so strange
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_15:0.9500:The situation puzzles them ; they don't know what
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_16:0.9500:to do :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_17:0.9500:But let them all lay down to-day the shovel and the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_21:0.9750:The rebel States come back so fast, for re-admission
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0259_23:0.9750:The powers of the President they're greatly over-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0260_1:0.9500:But let each wandering star once more upon our
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0260_15:0.9750:ponds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0260_16:1.0000:And gets no interest, now-a-days, on those Confed-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0260_17:0.9750:erate bonds !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0260_22:0.9750:Some doctrine we'll expound to them they call it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_3:0.9500:And boys enough, both north and south, who'd like
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_9:0.9750:I tell you what : I do believe this mighty Yankee
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_11:0.9500:When once it gets its "dander" up, can whip the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_15:0.9750:If people don't behave themselves, there'll be a pre-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_16:0.9500:cious row !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_17:0.9500:But I must stop my Pegasus, before he does his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_18:0.9500:worst ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_19:1.0000:He gets so full of patriotism, I fear the nag will
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_22:0.9500:told:
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0261_23:0.9750:It's time to close ; for I suspect the dinner's getting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_3:0.9500:The Yankee boys, the Irish boys, the steady, fear-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_8:1.0000:Long life, and health, and every good, be theirs in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_9:0.9500:bounteous store,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_10:0.9750:Till they shall join their comrades upon Jordan's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_11:0.9750:farther shore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_12:0.9750:And when the soil of centuries upon their graves is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_14:1.0000:Still may the grateful generations rise to call them
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_16:0.9750:And now, to glorious UNCLE SAM, let's give a rous-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_18:1.0000:The dear old Patriarch has reached almost his nine-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0262_19:1.0000:tieth year.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0263_21:0.9750:With those we witness here displayed, so tasteful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0263_24:0.9750:mates the throng,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0263_25:0.9750:And bring it hither, wrought in verse, and crystalized
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_5:0.9750:What memories and what hopes surround this point
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_7:0.9750:Betwixt the veiled To-morrow, and the beauteous
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_14:0.9500:her mien,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_15:0.9500:And lends new interest to the time, new beauty to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_19:1.0000:Which bound in holy wedlock, the bridegroom and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_20:0.9500:his bride ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_21:0.9750:And some were there, who now are here, and some
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0264_23:1.0000:Who bade the happy pair Godspeed, but fifteen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_3:0.9500:New friendships, and new ties are forming ever and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_5:0.9750:And some new comers I perceive, of tender ages
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_7:0.9500:The eldest is'nt yet fifteen ; they all look like their
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_9:0.9500:The bride and groom betray no serious ravages of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_13:0.9500:And yet for them so prosperously life's fickle stream
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_18:0.9500:And aided to administer the grand affairs of State,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0265_24:0.9500:To many a proud assemblage, and many an honored
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_3:0.9750:And greets us now, a courtly dame, and handsomer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_4:0.9500:than ever !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_7:0.9500:No jars except that harmless kind, for pickles and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_9:0.9500:Bright children ; very pleasant home, and well-to-do
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_15:1.0000:I know full well that latterly, there has been much
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_16:0.9500:fault-finding,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_19:0.9750:But I was made a Justice, when I lived in Massa-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_21:1.0000:Now here's a health, twice-wedded pair, to you and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0266_23:0.9750:Life's bounties may you richly share, in basket,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0267_5:0.9750:And when the years a decade more have swiftly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0267_7:0.9500:And time perchance hath silvered o'er your brows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0267_9:1.0000:Though weeping friends o'er many a tomb, tears
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0267_19:1.0000:To join each faithful hand with hand, in nuptials
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0267_21:0.9500:And finally, we wish you all the joys vouchsafed to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0268_2:0.9750:prove true and stable,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0268_3:0.9750:And Heaven grant you numerous olive-branches
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0268_7:0.9500:The crystal stream, the silver thrones, the city of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0268_9:1.0000:And join that august, shining throng, before the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_5:0.9500:How strange a thing is memory : as I gaze
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_6:1.0000:This night on comrades of those fruitful days,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_7:0.9750:When armed cohorts thronged on every hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_8:1.0000:And war's alarms and thunders shook the land ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_10:1.0000:My inmost thoughts and recollections stray,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_11:1.0000:And bygone scenes are passing in review,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_12:0.9750:Which, haply, I may reproduce to you.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0269_13:0.9750:And first, Camp Briggs* attracts my gaze ; the spot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_3:1.0000:A whilom three-months sergeant, and a funny, whole-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_6:0.9500:opening gun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_7:1.0000:And straightway boldly issued " General Order
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_10:0.9500:followed fast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_13:0.9750:And so, ten goodly companies encamped upon the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_15:0.9750:While tents and shanties multiplied, enlivening all
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0270_17:0.9500:O then 'twas drum-beat, morn and night, and tramp
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0271_3:0.9750:And ever and anon, at night, the rascals ran the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0271_16:0.9750:abreast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_1:0.9750:The beefsteak was exceeding good, and eke the pork
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_2:0.9500:and beans.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_3:0.9750:Our appetites were glorious, and we minded not the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_5:0.9500:And quaffed our coffee piping hot ; 'twould kill at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_8:0.9500:This grand old town, whose people were so generous
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_9:0.9750:and kind ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_10:1.0000:Where many a mansion, with the warmth of wel-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_12:1.0000:As, through the " witching hours," we tripped " the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_14:1.0000:And here, the pensive muse would pause, in sadness
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0272_15:0.9750:to deplore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0273_3:0.9500:But, by-and-bye, the nights grew cold, and winds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0273_5:0.9500:The guard-house was a populous and thriving insti-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0273_15:0.9500:Our train came not, and there we stood, a' shivering
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_1:0.9750:But, what with show of coffee and refreshments,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_3:1.0000:And sharing with the men the "gloom," we kept
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_5:0.9500:The welcome morning dawned at last; the tardy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_6:0.9750:train arrived ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_7:0.9500:We gave Camp Briggs a parting cheer ; our spirits
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_9:0.9500:With many a benediction from, many an anxious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_11:0.9500:Away we sped : and so I bring this chapter to an
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_15:1.0000:We came at night, and travel-worn for many a wea-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_17:1.0000:That snow-storm you'll remember, and the wintry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_18:0.9500:winds that blew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_19:0.9750:And the hospitable snow-drifts that we had to stum-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_20:0.9500:ble through.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0274_21:0.9750:But the commodious barracks, and the host of gen-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0276_7:1.0000:And spun his yarns, which made him out a devil
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_3:0.9750:To glad us with their charming smiles, and manners
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_5:1.0000:In truth I deem it very sure, had we much longer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_7:0.9500:Each bachelor would then and there have been de-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_9:0.9750:But orders came to move again ; again we watched
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_11:0.9750:From day to day, the coming of the transportation
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_17:0.9750:Next day we took the Norwich cars, and then the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_20:0.9750:Manhattan's shore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0277_21:0.9750:And so, one drizzly morning, fatigued and hungered
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_8:0.9500:camped ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_9:1.0000:The ground was wet, and so our feet and ardor both
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_10:0.9500:were damped ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_11:0.9500:However, we contrived to live and flourish passing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_18:1.0000:And many a day experienced the roughness of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_19:1.0000:clime ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0278_22:0.9750:The boys confiscated his goods, and smashed up his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_3:0.9750:Where trotting nags had quartered in the piping
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_4:0.9500:times of peace ;*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_5:0.9500:And here we stayed, and here we drilled, and kept
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_7:1.0000:And marched our soldiers back and forth, along the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_8:0.9500:smooth plank road.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_10:0.9500:vost work,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_13:0.9500:Our boys resolved themselves into a Vigilance Com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_17:0.9500:At length there came an order, to our most unfeign-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0279_19:0.9500:To embark our troops for Dixie, on the steamer " Il-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0280_7:1.0000:We found some strange attraction the briny surge
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0280_9:0.9750:And many a mouth was wide agape, and Charlie
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0280_13:0.9750:And many a fellow's diaphragm with dreadful qualms
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0280_20:1.0000:And once more, of smooth waters and green fields,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0280_22:0.9750:But our voyage seemed prosecuted beneath a luck-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_5:1.0000:She bore us up the river, and beneath the clear
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_9:0.9500:eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_10:1.0000:We gazed on fine plantations, as we swiftly floated
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_12:1.0000:The sweet abodes of peace they seemed, nor could
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_13:0.9500:we, from afar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_14:1.0000:Discern as yet the havoc wrought by fratricidal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_16:1.0000:And now, upborne in heaven, the Day-king held his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_18:0.9500:And in the glorious sunlight, a hundred steeples
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0281_19:0.9500:shone.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_1:0.9500:While in mid-stream the gunboats lay, with ever
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_3:1.0000:And iron fingers pointing towards the proud but con-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_4:0.9500:quered town.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_5:0.9500:And here we ate fresh oranges, and, after noon
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_6:0.9500:sailed on,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_7:1.0000:A few miles up the river, to encamp at Carrol-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_8:0.9500:ton,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_9:0.9500:A place, by no means such as that for which our
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_11:0.9500:The most attractive thing to us, was Madame
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_12:0.9750:Schraeder's cooking.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_13:0.9750:But here we met the Thirty-first ; and glad enough
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_15:1.0000:To welcome us, so lately come from Berkshire homes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_17:0.9750:And many a spot we talked about, where we would
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_19:1.0000:Of dinners that we used to eat, and beds we used to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0282_23:0.9500:And studied its geography, and learned its devious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_3:0.9750:But, others having been and gone, we brought away
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_6:0.9750:chill and dark,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_7:0.9500:It took us until past midnight, our baggage to em-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_8:0.9500:bark ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_9:0.9750:The Major's horse fell overboard ; we bivouacked
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_12:0.9750:encumber us no more !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_16:0.9750:walls of white ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_19:1.0000:Along the river's eastern shore, the noble stream
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0283_23:0.9750:And carried on our strict routine with order and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_4:1.0000:And here, until the fourteenth day of March, we lay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_5:0.9750:at ease,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_6:1.0000:When General Banks conceived a plan, with force
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_10:0.9750:I'll sing that olden ballad ; it will aid our memories
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_13:0.9500:Banks, of Shenandoah fame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0284_15:0.9500:That Port Hudson, on the river,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_2:1.0000:And sent without delay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_3:0.9750:An order to his Chief of Staff,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_4:0.9750:To summon his array.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_5:1.0000:He summoned to him Farragut,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_6:1.0000:And gave him orders sealed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_7:1.0000:Then, girding on his armor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_8:1.0000:With his staff he took the field.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_9:1.0000:Attend ye to the story,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_10:1.0000:Which I will now relate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_11:1.0000:It happened in the Lowlands
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_13:1.0000:'Twas on a cool March morning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_14:1.0000:When we our steeds bestrode ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_15:1.0000:And, just as day was dawning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_17:1.0000:We crossed the Montesino
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_18:0.9750:By plank bridge, and pontoon ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0285_19:1.0000:And halted for the bivouac,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_1:1.0000:We plucked the rails from off the fence
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_2:1.0000:Of boards there were but few,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_3:1.0000:And spread our scanty shelter tents,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_4:1.0000:To shield us from the dew.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_5:1.0000:The air was filled with squeal of pigs,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_6:1.0000:And cackle of the geese ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_7:1.0000:While stalwart oxen lost their hides,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_8:1.0000:And simple lambs, their fleece.*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_9:1.0000:And now the night was falling,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_10:1.0000:Soon rose the evening star ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_11:1.0000:And through the deepening twilight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_12:1.0000:Gleamed camp-fires from afar.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_13:0.9500:But hark ! what noise arises 1
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_14:1.0000:This night we sleep no more ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0286_15:1.0000:For the tide of battle surges
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_1:0.9500:And now, an aide from Chapin,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_3:1.0000:An order brings to form the line
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_4:0.9750:In haste, without parades.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_5:1.0000:Upon his own black stallion
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_6:0.9500:Sat the gallant Brigadier ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_7:1.0000:And he called to him the Colonel,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_8:1.0000:And he whispered in his ear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_9:0.9750:" Our army has attacked the Fort,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_10:0.9750:And been repulsed ; " they say
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0287_11:0.9750:" In haste overtake the Forty-eighth,f
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_1:0.9750:The road is blocked with wagons,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_2:1.0000:The darkness settles down ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_3:1.0000:But swiftly marched the FORTY-NINTH,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_4:0.9750:In silence back to town.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_6:0.9500:But swifter far than they,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_7:1.0000:Beneath their feet, the Forty-eighth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_8:1.0000:Let no grass grow, that day.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_9:0.9750:Their Colonel had been ordered
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_10:0.9750:By General Banks, they say
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_11:0.9500:To hold the Montesino,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_12:1.0000:And keep the foe at bay.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_14:1.0000:No foe was there discovered ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_15:1.0000:And silence was the deity,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_16:1.0000:That o'er the valley hovered.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_17:1.0000:Ah, then, the gallant Forty-eighth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_18:1.0000:Did mighty deeds of valor ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_19:1.0000:And courage on each countenance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_20:1.0000:Assumed the place of pallor.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_21:1.0000:And now their Colonel, homeward bent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0288_22:1.0000:Their manly zeal arouses ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_2:1.0000:Our lumber and cook-houses ! "*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_3:1.0000:And so, for many a weary mile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_4:1.0000:In toilsome march, we find them ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_5:1.0000:Before them were their household gods ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_7:1.0000:And now, a short half mile ahead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_8:1.0000:The old camp greets their vision ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_9:1.0000:And each indulges sweet foretaste
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_10:1.0000:Of sleep and dreams elysian.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_11:1.0000:But look ! behind, a cloud of dust
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_12:1.0000:Our eyes are now discerning ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_13:1.0000:It cannot be ; it is, it is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_14:1.0000:An order for returning !f
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_16:1.0000:Had trotted on before ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_17:1.0000:And so he did not hear his flock,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0289_18:0.9500:How dreadfully they swore !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_1:1.0000:The sun was near his setting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_2:1.0000:The clouds betokened rain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_3:0.9750:When, having reached the Bayou,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_4:1.0000:We pitched our tents again.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_5:1.0000:And now, in all their fury,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_6:1.0000:The elements are roaring ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_7:1.0000:And down in copious torrents,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_8:1.0000:The watery flood is pouring.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_9:1.0000:O, orange groves and palm-trees !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_10:1.0000:O, land of milk and honey !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_11:1.0000:Where " zephyrs were so very soft,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_12:1.0000:And skies so bright and sunny ;"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_13:0.9750:We thought to spend a winter here,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_14:1.0000:Should fortune so decree it,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_15:1.0000:Would be the thing : but, on that night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_16:1.0000:We really couldn't see it !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_17:0.9750:All o'er the deeply-furrowed field, *
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_18:1.0000:The waters rose so high,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0290_19:1.0000:Our boys could neither make their beds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_1:0.9750:The guns with rust were covered o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_2:1.0000:And many a luckless wight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_3:1.0000:Began to think his chance was slim,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_4:0.9750:If forced into a fight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_5:1.0000:But if he dared to try his piece,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_6:1.0000:And if it chanced to go ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_7:1.0000:He had to stand at " shoulder arms,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_8:0.9750:For half a day or so.*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_10:0.9500:For six long days we stayed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_11:0.9750:To tempt the rebel foemen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_12:0.9750:Our precinct to invade.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_13:0.9750:We gobbled up their sugar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_14:1.0000:We licked their syrup fine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0291_15:1.0000:And longed to lick the rebel
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_1:0.9500:But only to O'Brien's* gaze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_2:0.9750:And the gallant cavaliers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_3:0.9750:Who hailed from "Little Bhody,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_4:0.9750:The enemy appears.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_6:1.0000:His whole brigade deploy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_8:1.0000:The rebels to decoy.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_9:1.0000:For, as that famous army
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_10:0.9750:Aforetime, marched in vain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_11:1.0000:So, Dudley did go forward,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_12:1.0000:And bravely back again.t
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0292_13:1.0000:Of all that week's adventures,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_3:1.0000:At length there came an order
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_4:1.0000:On dress-parade 't was read ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_5:1.0000:'T was General Banks who sent it,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_6:1.0000:Now what do you think it said ? t
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_8:1.0000:Our object is attained ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_9:1.0000:Your cue is to be jubilant,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_10:1.0000:For victory has been gained.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_11:1.0000:" Perhaps you deemed it ' ninning,'
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_12:1.0000:The morn you were so fleet ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_13:1.0000:But the truth is you were making
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_14:1.0000:A ' masterly retreat ! '
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_15:0.9750:"You see, I only wanted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_16:1.0000:While Farragut passed through
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_17:1.0000:The gauntlet on the river
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_18:1.0000:That you should halloo ' Boo ! ! ! '
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0293_19:1.0000:" I came a week beforehand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_1:0.9500:And had a very grand review ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_2:1.0000:But that was all for show.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_3:0.9750:" And now, my boys, I thank ye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_5:1.0000:Go back to camp and rest ye
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_6:1.0000:On the laurels ye have won.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_7:1.0000:" And in the long hereafter,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_8:0.9750:Be this your glorious boast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_15:0.9500:dwell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0294_16:0.9500:On that momentous conflict, and the fate which there
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0295_5:0.9500:Who sleep in nameless graves afar beneath that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0295_7:0.9500:And whose souls were thence uplifted to the pres-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0295_17:0.9500:O, such a brotherhood as ours, we shall not find else-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_1:0.9500:The warm, fraternal flame within our breasts can
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_7:1.0000:They have crossed the stream to where the fields
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_9:0.9500:And we, upon its hither shore, are lingering yet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_11:0.9750:Yet not unscathed did we escape the battle's angry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_13:0.9750:I stand surrounded here by many a scarred and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_15:0.9500:The grim Death-Angel, hurling forth his missiles
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_17:0.9500:Gave some of us the tokens of his presence as he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_19:0.9500:Then let us praise the God of Hosts, whose overrul-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0296_24:1.0000:In that mysterious sleep which peradventure we had
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0297_3:0.9750:Ere the harp be unstrung, and its minstrelsy ended,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0298_3:0.9500:The rapture of social enjoyment bestowing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0299_19:0.9750:And yet, upon this festal day, when, on my native
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_5:0.9500:hold
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_9:0.9500:And on the sweet vale, as of yore, the lordly hills
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_10:0.9500:look down.-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_11:1.0000:I clasp the hands of early friends ; while, answering
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_15:0.9750:The present and the past unite ; the mountains
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_16:0.9500:greet the sea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_17:0.9500:The rare occasion is replete with poetry to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_19:0.9500:beneath the sun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_20:1.0000:Here were my earliest lessons learned ; my earliest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_22:0.9750:Here the delightful school-boy days flew onward all
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0300_24:0.9500:And here my early manhood years in sweet content
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_3:1.0000:Have I, in unforgotten days, enjoyed and welcomed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_5:0.9500:There's many an " old inhabitant " can testify, I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_7:0.9500:What annual racket I helped make say twenty
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_11:0.9750:And make the whole night hideous with glare, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_13:0.9500:I met some of them, older grown last evening at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_17:0.9500:But those old times have passed away ; their very
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_18:0.9500:memories seem
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0301_19:0.9750:Far down the distant retrospect, like some mysteri-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_1:0.9500:The " woolen works " in Barrington were then but
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_3:1.0000:And Bridgeport, an obscure resort for men in quest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_5:0.9750:The steam-car was unknown up through the Housa-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_8:0.9500:a rail ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_9:0.9500:The man who lived in Berkshire, and had seen Long
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_11:0.9750:Was no small " pumpkins," you may bet, in all the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_13:0.9500:But, by-and-by, the thought occurred to some sa-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_16:0.9500:ties to bind ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_17:1.0000:So, Barrington's the depot now for many a thriving
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_19:0.9500:And Bridgeport has become, indeed, a city of re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_20:0.9500:nown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_21:0.9750:And so it was a pleasant thought for Berkshire boys,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0302_23:1.0000:To bid us hasten hither from a hundred miles
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0303_3:1.0000:Inhaled with this sweet atmosphere among the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0303_12:0.9500:May each have added one bright link to memory's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_5:0.9750:I GO back twenty years to-night, and bring to mind
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_6:0.9750:the days,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_7:0.9750:When with my college peers I strove to win scholas-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_8:0.9500:tic bays ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_14:1.0000:For I'm a Berkshire boy, and gained my academic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_16:1.0000:In what you might be pleased to term, a mere " fresh-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_17:0.9500:water college."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_18:1.0000:O, very pleasant were the hours we spent within the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0304_20:0.9500:Where our enthroned Hierophant alone unveiled his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_3:0.9500:When each commencement-day brought on a bevy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_8:0.9750:I've been a politician since, and mingled in the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_12:0.9750:the ring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_13:0.9500:And button-holed the Governor, and all that sort of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_15:0.9750:But ne'er within my memory did affairs of such con-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_16:1.0000:cern
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_20:1.0000:And bear away the honors at the college exhibi-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_21:0.9500:tions.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_22:0.9500:And when it chanced, to gladden my enthusiastic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0305_24:0.9750:That on the victor's person flashed the badge of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_3:1.0000:For men still clutch their playthings, and are simply
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_7:0.9500:spirit ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_8:1.0000:The tree inclines precisely as at first you bend the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_9:0.9500:twig
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_12:0.9750:The youth who leads a college clique, will, doubtless,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_16:1.0000:And he whom all his cronies hailed, a jovial, genial
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_18:1.0000:Will hold his own, e'en when the leaf of life is sere
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_21:0.9500:now,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0306_22:0.9500:Alternate shade and sunshine seem to flit across my
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_3:0.9750:And note with varied sentiments what time for each
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_6:0.9750:termine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_7:0.9500:The weighty matters of the law, and wear judicial
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_9:0.9500:And some have found the source of wealth remark-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_12:0.9500:cific.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_13:0.9500:Some argue causes at the bar, and legal quibbles
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_16:1.0000:young idea to shoot ;"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_17:1.0000:Some deal in goods and merchandise, with manners
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_18:0.9500:bland and pleasing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0307_19:0.9500:And some the tortured purse of poor old " Uncle

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_6:0.9750:cares ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_7:1.0000:Some operate in fancy stocks, among the ' Bulls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_9:0.9750:Some scribble for the papers, and employ the art
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_11:0.9750:Some wake the oratorio strain, and some the strain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_13:0.9750:And some, in life's bright morning, have responded
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_15:0.9500:Which, soon or late, shall send forth its alarum to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_17:0.9750:I count upon that little list, the death stars ; they
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_19:0.9750:So many old-time friends have sped from earth we
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0308_21:0.9750:But turn we now to witness, after lapse of twenty
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_2:0.9500:archs grow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_3:0.9750:And they who plant, do oftentimes plant wiser than
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_5:1.0000:The tender shoot, whose destiny no mortal might

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_11:0.9750:To hear the whispering of its leaves, and linger
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_12:0.9500:'neath its shade.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_13:0.9750:We build our own best monuments ; our own deeds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_14:0.9750:after all,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0309_19:1.0000:And, dying, leave behind us footprints on the sands

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0310_9:0.9750:Emotions passing sweetest song my inmost heart

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0311_2:0.9500:to me,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0311_3:0.9750:And my compeers, you owe it now, to cultivate the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0311_4:0.9500:tree ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0311_5:1.0000:So shall it thrive, and may kind Heaven vouchsafe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0311_7:0.9500:May live to see our grand-sons wear the badge of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_5:1.0000:And the shades of night were falling on .1 certain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_6:0.9500:sea-coast town -,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_7:1.0000:When a few congenial spirits somehow happened to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_9:0.9500:At the Doctor's to assemble, and discourse of tur-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_11:0.9750:Now, these chaps who thus assembled, we may just
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_13:0.9750:Were a parcel of stockholders in a famous enter-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_15:1.0000:To extract from out a cord of wood, when duly baked
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_17:0.9750:Turpentine, tar, coal, and acid, and no end of gas
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_19:1.0000:But like all contrivance human, this had had its ups
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_20:0.9750:and downs,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0312_21:0.9750:And dame fortune had cajoled it with alternate

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_3:1.0000:Had been frequent as the changes and vicissitudes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_7:1.0000:It was better than his doses to behold the Doctor's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_8:0.9500:smile.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_9:1.0000:When 't was thought the " Holmes " was cast away,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_13:0.9750:Now, on this same first of April, there had been a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_15:1.0000:And the hopes of all the party were proportionately
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_17:0.9500:And the Doctor was foretelling, with the wisdom of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_18:0.9500:a prophet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_19:1.0000:How this would beat all frying pans elsewhere this
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_21:1.0000:Just then there came a knocking at the Doctor's of-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0313_23:0.9750:And a rather stout man opened it, and stalked the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_1:0.9500:Said he, " Get up your horse, Doctor, as quick as
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_2:0.9750:e'er you can,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_3:0.9750:Our deuced works are all a-fire, as I'm a living
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_5:0.9750:Up rose the frightened company, in consternation
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_7:0.9750:And on each countenance at once -there came a sol-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_8:0.9750:emn pall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_10:0.9750:fool am I,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_11:0.9500:There's no such thing ; and as for you, I tell you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_13:1.0000:But the stout man called the negro man, and bade
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_14:0.9750:him go ahead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_15:0.9750:And get the best nag harnessed, and the buggy from
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_16:0.9500:the shed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_17:0.9500:And the Doctor compromised so far, he'd go at least
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_21:0.9500:They westward drove the Doctor and the stout
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0314_23:0.9500:A lurid light the while had come, the western sky to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_3:0.9750:When all at once the dreadful scene burst forth upon
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_7:0.9750:And can that be our kindling wood which makes that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_9:0.9750:And must they burst, those tender chords, that bind
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_11:0.9750:To all those cords of wood, and eke that tar and

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_15:1.0000:Regarded Nature's grander moods, and watched the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_19:1.0000:Up toward the stars, to contemplate those blazing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_20:0.9500:cinders climb ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0315_23:0.9750:Of sorrow, as I only see my fondest hopes go
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_5:0.9500:In rage the Doctor lashed his steed ; they quickly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_7:0.9750:Which brought them to the fated spot where they
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_8:0.9500:had staked theL pile.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_11:1.0000:For that which was, but now had gone to that pro-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_13:0.9750:The pensive pilgrim, as he wends his way along the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0316_15:0.9500:May note to-day an inlet, whose good harborage is

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_5:1.0000:And bade me in some simple lay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_6:0.9750:Recall the times of yore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_7:1.0000:When you and I were lass and lad,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_8:1.0000:And life-tints all were rosy,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_11:1.0000:So, Josie, dear ; for e'en so now
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_12:1.0000:I'll venture to address thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_13:1.0000:Tho' other lips returned thy vow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_14:1.0000:And other hands caress thee,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_15:1.0000:A ballad of the olden time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_16:1.0000:I'll sing ; but since our houses
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_17:1.0000:Are side by side, pray keep the rhyme
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_18:1.0000:A secret from our spouses !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_19:1.0000:And to begin : two decades back
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_20:0.9750:Along the vale of years,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0317_21:1.0000:A distant speck on memory's track,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_1:1.0000:The place is strangely altered now,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_2:0.9750:And where the roses flourished,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_3:1.0000:There stands a shrine where sinners bow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_4:1.0000:And hungry souls are nourished.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_5:1.0000:I mind me of the " corridor "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_6:1.0000:A sort of masked embrasure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_7:0.9750:Behind which maidens waited for
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_8:1.0000:And spied the beaux at leisure.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_9:1.0000:I mind me of the houses twain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_10:1.0000:Between, the cosy arbor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_11:1.0000:When " Tommy " chased some venturous swain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_14:1.0000:Where precept and example
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_15:0.9500:Were both combined in three staid maids
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_16:1.0000:'T would seem the means were ample
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_17:0.9750:To keep those cloistered nuns intent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_18:0.9750:Upon the tasks before them ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_19:1.0000:And yet how many a smile was lent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_20:1.0000:To lads who dared adore them !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_21:1.0000:And oh ! what various, nameless arts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_22:1.0000:And how much necromancy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0318_23:0.9750:Did occupy those loving hearts,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_3:0.9750:How, in a trice, on many a night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_4:0.9750:That lawn became Sahara,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_5:1.0000:As dawned on some fond couple's sight,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_6:1.0000:The spectre of " Miss Sarah ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_7:0.9750:I recollect the serenade
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_8:0.9750:Was quite a favorite cover,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_9:0.9750:'Neath which the old, old game was played
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_10:0.9750:'Twixt lady-love and lover :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_11:1.0000:For, while the song allured each ear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_12:1.0000:And melodies were blending,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_13:0.9750:The Miff* <lu".r to windows near
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_14:0.9750:Were covertly ascending !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_15:0.9500:But as for me, I quite despised
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_16:0.9750:The rash, adventurous measures,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_17:1.0000:By ardent lovers improvised
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_18:1.0000:For amatory pleasures.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_19:1.0000:To me opposed no envious space
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_20:1.0000:Those fairy realms to gain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_21:0.9750:For, 'twixt them and my dwelling-place
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_22:0.9500:"Was nothing but a lane.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_23:0.9750:Lord ! how my heart went pit-a-pat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_24:0.9750:And all that sort of thing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_25:0.9500:As 'neath that portico I sat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0319_26:0.9750:To hear my charmer sing.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_1:1.0000:I studied law, or so professed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_2:1.0000:But now, at this remove,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_3:1.0000:The truth were just as well confessed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_4:1.0000:I learned no law but love.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_5:1.0000:yes ! I fell in love, of course ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_6:1.0000:But did not dare to tell it,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_7:1.0000:For fear 'twould make the matter worse,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_8:0.9500:Should my beloved repel it.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_9:1.0000:'Twere bad enough to lose my heart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_10:1.0000:But vastly better so,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_11:1.0000:Than have my darling say " depart ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_12:1.0000:And tell me" not for Joe ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_13:1.0000:And so, no doubt, it came about
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_14:1.0000:That when school-days were over,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_15:1.0000:" That other fellow " found you out,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_16:1.0000:And proved a bolder lover.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_17:1.0000:But, sometimes, as my thoughts recur
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0320_18:0.9750:To that " Kose Cottage " garden,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_6:0.9750:STRANGE ! how a clam, a closed-mouthed thing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_8:1.0000:Should make you all so clamorous for speech, or
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_10:1.0000:But observation goes to show, at divers times and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_12:0.9750:The stillest fellows, oftentimes, turn out the hardest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_14:1.0000:A missive from the adjutant, a week or so ago,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0321_20:0.9500:He bade me join the festive crowd, and gulph a clam
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0322_3:1.0000:And clams with toast, and toasts with clams; so,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0322_7:1.0000:You only want to ope my shell, and then, to draw
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0322_12:0.9750:And yet, upon reflection, it will never do,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0322_18:0.9500:And so I come ; and knowing well how very apt I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0322_23:1.0000:Done up like clams, compact and round I never
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_3:0.9750:Who erst amid the battle's din, stood firmly by the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_5:0.9750:And oft on many a well-fought field, made every
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_9:0.9500:Right bravely did ye clamber up the heights, where
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_11:0.9750:The foe, amid the horrid din and clamor of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_15:0.9750:Resolved to break their boasted shell, and sworn to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_17:0.9750:Oh, how as yesterday they seem the old familiar
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_19:0.9750:Of which we each and all were part, way down at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0323_23:0.9500:In every one I recognize a comrade and a broth-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0324_5:0.9500:And live to see a grand career attend our Uncle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0324_7:0.9500:And spend his days in sweet content, and happy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0325_11:0.9500:When once we get a glimpse of it, is always worth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0325_17:0.9500:Till some day you shall meet him with his harness
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0325_19:0.9500:And find him, to your great surprise, a downright
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0325_21:0.9750:I knew a man, I thought so mean, 'twas simply his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_3:1.0000:He'd turn into high carnival, the stiffest quaker
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_4:0.9750:meeting!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_5:0.9750:Men's very foibles often make their most attractive
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_7:1.0000:To tell the truth 'twixt you and me I hate these
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_9:1.0000:I honor each embodiment of goodness, truth and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_11:0.9500:But hang the chap who won't confess one amiable
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_13:0.9750:The life of every mortal man is more or less a rid^
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_15:0.9500:Why, Nero must have had some soul ; because he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_16:0.9750:played the fiddle !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_17:1.0000:The hardest, driest human plant which Nature e'er
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_19:1.0000:Would not be human, did it not exude some frag-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_20:0.9750:rant juices.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_22:0.9500:trite,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0326_23:0.9750:There must be poets who can feel what other poets
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_3:0.9500:In tabernacles not of clay, may one day find a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_5:0.9750:The whiter side of every man no matter how re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_7:0.9750:However brave, however great, or gifted, or pro-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_9:1.0000:It is the side which gives the zest to biographic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_11:1.0000:And rounds at least the hero's fame, and supple-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_12:0.9750:ments his glory.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_13:1.0000:The hero soon becomes a myth, who shows no
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_14:0.9750:whiter side ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_15:1.0000:Of whom grave history simply states, he lived and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_17:1.0000:Some altogether human traits their added light must
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_19:0.9750:Or else, although his works survive, the man is very-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_21:0.9750:His whiter side, when all the scenes of mortal life are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0327_23:1.0000:I reckon will best satisfy the man himself at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_3:0.9750:How, when they die, they always turn the whiter
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_7:0.9750:To sink our selfish selves, and let our better selves
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_13:0.9750:each other,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_18:1.0000:elsewhere !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_19:0.9750:Here let us interchange the gifts vouchsafed us from
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0328_24:0.9500:A little purged of earthly dross a little nearer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0329_2:0.9500:not strained
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0329_3:0.9750:From far beyond the milky-way, like gentle dew-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0329_5:1.0000:Perhaps the song has been obscure ; perhaps it was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0329_6:1.0000:your blindness
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0329_7:1.0000:You recognize the theme at last " The Milk of Hu-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_6:1.0000:Or, if the Florid thinks he's floored,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_7:1.0000:They know not well the subtle powers
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_8:1.0000:By which the brightest color's lowered.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_12:1.0000:He 'scaped ; I fell, but take the blame.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_13:1.0000:They reckon ill who count me out ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_14:0.9750:When quick I fly, I triumph bring ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_15:1.0000:I am the router and the rout

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_17:0.9750:Galusha trespassed on our aisle,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_18:1.0000:I knew not of his sacred art ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_19:1.0000:Now a meek Christian do I smile
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0330_20:0.9750:I heard no sound, I feel no smart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0331_2:0.9750:For ; If a Dutchman thinks he hits,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0331_3:1.0000:Or, if the fallen feels a blow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0331_4:1.0000:They know not well the subtle pits
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_6:0.9750:When the spring-time lingers only to resign her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_9:0.9500:we tread
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_10:0.9500:Where the proud earth shrines the ashes of our

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_14:0.9750:But we do not heed their presence, as to-day we pass
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_16:0.9750:And the harvest of the roses with a jealous hand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_17:0.9500:bestow,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_20:0.9500:Let republics prove unmindful of the love they once
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0332_22:1.0000:And withhold the meed of honor from their noblest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_2:0.9500:aside,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_3:1.0000:And forget those who but yesterday so gloriously
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_5:0.9750:We have sworn that long as unto us remembrances
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_7:1.0000:Of the sad adieus to cherished ones, and dear de-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_8:0.9500:lights of home ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_9:0.9500:Of the hardships of the prison, of the pestilence's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_13:0.9750:That the comrades who endured with us the labor

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_17:0.9750:Shall be heroes of a treasured past, we shall not
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0333_21:1.0000:And to all else we give pause to-day, that vernal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_1:0.9500:And we gather 'neath these fresh-clad boughs, that,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_14:0.9500:and in cot,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_15:0.9750:Hath been twined the fair anemone with sweet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_17:1.0000:And in many a nameless orphan-girl hath 'wakened
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_19:1.0000:To assert, in this mute eloquence, the valor of her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_21:0.9750:O ! the wealth of buried heroes that our nation boasts
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0334_23:1.0000:In the soil where we were nurtured, on the prairies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_2:0.9500:tain side,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_3:1.0000:They are sleeping 'neath the altars for whose sanc-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_4:0.9500:tity they died.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_5:1.0000:But, my comrades, we would ne'er forget, nor could

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_16:0.9750:in their turn ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_17:0.9750:Or in trenches, where in hot haste, when the bat-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_18:0.9500:tle's rage was spent,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_19:1.0000:Horse and rider, friend and foeman, in red burial
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_20:0.9500:were blent !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0335_23:0.9750:Gazing out upon a future with auroral hopes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_2:0.9500:rays should shed,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_5:1.0000:Little dreamed he, little dreamed ye, who had known
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_7:0.9500:How much God-like and heroic in his nature was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_9:1.0000:Which occasion should enkindle, till from mean and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_10:1.0000:trivial things,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0336_11:0.9500:He should rise to deeds that challenge envy in the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_3:0.9750:And our thoughts in ghostly forms to-day, are hover-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_5:0.9500:And the wild-birds sing their requiem above their
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_7:1.0000:And the sad magnolia, weeping there, its solemn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_9:0.9500:And the voices, inarticulate, of Nature's choir, de-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_11:1.0000:That the soil around is hallowed ground, for the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_12:1.0000:warrior dead are there !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_13:0.9750:Let them sleep, while roll the centuries in ceaseless
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0337_15:0.9500:Till at last the grand Reveille sounds to usher in the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_3:1.0000:That are going and are coming, through the wilder-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_4:1.0000:ness of years ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_5:0.9750:Here to-day, the waves of Lethe we would glaglly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_6:0.9500:hold in thrall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_7:0.9750:But its dark, oblivious waters, must ere long engulf
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_8:0.9750:us all ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_9:1.0000:And our story in the distant future ages shall be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_17:1.0000:In the everlasting Drama, hath a part for each and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_18:0.9500:all.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0338_19:0.9750:After all, then, life is earnest, and in life's severe re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_5:0.9750:extremest span,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_6:1.0000:Yet who never was accounted, and who never was,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_8:0.9500:Do not mourn, O stricken widow ; do not mourn, be-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_9:0.9750:reaved sire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_10:0.9750:For the loved one, swift-ascended, pure from the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_12:1.0000:As these flowers to-day betoken, scattered o'er his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_13:0.9500:lowly tomb,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_14:1.0000:In the Paradisean gardens, evermore his soul shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_15:1.0000:bloom !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_18:1.0000:ish not.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_19:0.9750:As the stone sunk in mid-ocean, sends a ripple to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0339_21:1.0000:So each deed, once done, is making larger circles
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_6:0.9500:Looking forth from yonder Heaven, our apostrophe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_8:0.9500:Tarry not ; we bid ye rather to celestial bowers re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_10:0.9750:While we only guard your ashes, safe in history's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_12:0.9750:Now from these sweet ceremonies, friends and com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_14:0.9750:Somewhat wiser, somewhat better, and with hearts
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_15:1.0000:that overflow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0340_16:0.9750:With a love, benign and catholic, whose promptings
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_5:0.9750:SOUND the dirge, the requiem sing ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_6:1.0000:Floral wreaths and garlands bring ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_7:1.0000:Scatter roses o'er each grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_8:1.0000:Where in glory sleep the brave.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_9:1.0000:Passed away before life's noon,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_10:1.0000:Who shall say they died too soon ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_11:0.9750:Ye who mourn, O, cease from tears.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_12:1.0000:Deeds like theirs outlast the years.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_13:1.0000:Crown the sod with beauteous wreath,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_14:1.0000:While our heroes sleep beneath.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_15:1.0000:Softly, sweetly, let them rest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_16:0.9500:With our benedictions blest.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_17:1.0000:Let our voices hymn their praise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_18:1.0000:Martyrs of illustrious days ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_19:1.0000:While their spirits hover near,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0341_20:1.0000:Pleased our grateful song to hear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0342_2:1.0000:Both the dead and living share ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0342_3:1.0000:When life's conflicts all are past,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0342_4:0.9750:Bring us unto peace at last.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_5:0.9500:AND now, my comrades, faithful still, again we wel-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_6:0.9500:come here
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_7:1.0000:The saddest and the gladdest day of all the rolling
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_8:0.9750:year;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_9:0.9750:And come once more to decorate with sweet me-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_11:1.0000:The early graves, the honored graves, that haply
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_12:0.9500:had been ours.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_13:0.9750:The grasses thicken o'er those graves : more thickly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_15:1.0000:The roots have grown above each form, the sacred
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_16:0.9750:sod to bind ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_17:0.9750:And so our common love hath grown a thing more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_19:1.0000:And sturdier faith points upward to the heroes' rest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_21:0.9500:On every hand, throughout the land, with measured
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_22:0.9500:tread, and slow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0343_23:0.9750:I seem to see our serried bands in sad procession
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_3:1.0000:And plant the flag for which he died, above the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_5:0.9750:But grander army, statelier pomp, and spectacle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_7:1.0000:With sweeter strains than here awake the circum-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_8:1.0000:ambient air
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_9:0.9750:Procession of the memories the muse would lead
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_10:0.9500:this hour,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_11:0.9500:But words are base interpreters, and song hath lost
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_12:0.9750:its power.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_15:0.9750:Whence some rare plant should quick upspring, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_18:0.9500:random strown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0344_22:1.0000:Did we discern or heed no more than greets the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_3:0.9500:But O, 'tis neither all nor what we long to feel and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_5:0.9500:Our unobtrusive place in life we each resign to-day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_8:0.9750:Swift vehicles of memory are translating us afar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_11:1.0000:Once more we wear the blue, and wield the musket
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_13:0.9500:Once more at morn, the mounting guard at eve the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_15:1.0000:Once more the drill, the camp-routine, inspection
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_17:0.9500:Once more, at break and close of day, reveille and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_21:0.9500:And gather the experience of battle's fierce alarms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0345_24:1.0000:And view once more the blood-stained fields, where
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_4:0.9750:cbred clay ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_5:1.0000:Once more, by night, the bivouac beneath the starry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_7:1.0000:The silent prayer, the brief repose, the wistful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_9:0.9500:O, tell me, in an hour like this, in what o'erwhelm-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_10:0.9500:ing flood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_11:1.0000:Do they not all return those scenes of toil, and fire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_15:1.0000:What pictures line its walls ; what spectres haunt its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_17:0.9750:This day is theirs, and no less ours, who, from the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_18:0.9750:hither shore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_19:1.0000:Of that dark Stygian stream, beheld their spirits
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_21:0.9750:The dead are with us ; we do feel their presence as
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0346_23:0.9750:The memories we invoke are theirs, but yours and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_9:1.0000:The mother, who yearned after him, as he went forth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_10:0.9750:to die;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_11:1.0000:The maid, who gave the honeyed kiss, as bravely
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_13:0.9750:He hastened, who should ne'er return to claim her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_17:1.0000:of wife;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_18:0.9500:Who sadly oh, how patiently ! the weary months
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_20:0.9500:And wears to-day the widow's weeds, and clasps the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_23:0.9500:vision here?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0347_24:1.0000:Shall we not hush wliile they bedew these garlands
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_3:0.9500:O'er which, if there be tears in Heaven, the pious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_5:0.9500:Alas! dear friends, sad thoughts must come this
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_6:0.9750:hour to each and all ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_7:0.9500:Somehow on every heart and home, the shadows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_9:0.9500:Each breast some missing idol shrines, we would no-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_10:0.9750:wise disown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_11:0.9500:Nor with iconoclastic hand dissever from its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_13:0.9500:And yet, somewhat of pride, I ween, awakes in every
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_16:0.9750:a part.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_17:0.9750:Some Spartan spirit yet inspires : some patriotic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_19:1.0000:Still warms the stricken breast, and bids it bravely
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_21:1.0000:In years to come, as older grown, the orphan boy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_22:0.9750:shall read,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0348_23:0.9500:How in some grand, terrific hour, was wrought some
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_2:0.9500:wear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_3:0.9750:If he can say to all the world ; " My father perished
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_5:0.9750:And you, my comrades, tell me now how e'er your
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_6:0.9750:lines be cast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_7:0.9750:As life is short, and you survey the record of your
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_9:1.0000:Say, is it not the darling thought in grateful mem-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_10:0.9750:ory's store,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_11:1.0000:In that our country's trying hour, the faithful part
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_12:0.9750:you bore !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_15:1.0000:Before Port Hudson, midst a sea of carnage and . of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_16:0.9500:blood.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_17:0.9750:A chief rode down the shattered lines, and kindled
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_19:0.9750:With these proud words: "Press on, my boys;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_21:0.9500:Thank God! that history hath been made; and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0349_23:1.0000:As consummating ages roll, on blazoned page and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_3:1.0000:Whose crescent influence shall be felt, when we have
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_5:0.9500:And now, dear friends, I know what fond emotions
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_7:0.9750:At such a season still remain, voiceless and unex-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_8:0.9500:pressed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_9:1.0000:Each heart in all this gathered throng goes some-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_11:1.0000:And seeks, beside some single grave, a treasure of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_13:1.0000:And here and there some noble deed, some few re-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_14:1.0000:member well,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_15:0.9500:Whose glory passed unheralded, and history shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_16:0.9500:not tell;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_18:0.9500:his name
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_19:0.9500:To wondering posterities : so dear, so cheap is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_20:0.9500:fame !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_21:0.9500:I mind me of a noble boy, whose mother's sad con-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_22:0.9750:sent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0350_23:0.9750:Enrolled him with the heroes of a gallant regi-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_2:0.9500:reer began,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_4:0.9750:man !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_5:0.9750:There came the battle summons as in hospital he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_7:1.0000:Where yet the fever threatened to consume his life
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_8:0.9500:away ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_9:1.0000:The army moved ; the tidings reached the sick boy's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_11:1.0000:Straightway he rose : the dangerous way, alone, he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_13:0.9500:There came a call for volunteers, with musket and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_15:1.0000:To first assault the hostile works, and fill the ditch
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_16:0.9750:between ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_17:1.0000:Whose courage in that solemn hour should stand the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_19:1.0000:The roll was quickly filled with names, that boy's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_21:0.9500:Next morn, awaiting hasty rites of sepulture, was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0351_23:0.9750:A row of heroes stark, cold forms beneath the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_1:0.9500:Each rigid face looked heavenward with fixed and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_3:1.0000:And saddest sight of all to me the noble boy lay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_5:1.0000:The blanket in his knapsack found, his winding-sheet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_7:0.9500:And, all uncoffined, in the trench his mangled corpse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_8:0.9500:was laid ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_9:0.9500:With reverent hands the clods above his lifeless
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_11:0.9750:And so, his work well done, the youthful warrior
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_13:1.0000:Above his dust the stranger treads to-day, and heed-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_17:0.9750:Yet, unforgetful of the life that boy his country
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_18:0.9500:gave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_19:0.9750:I tell you, here and now I place a wreath upon his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_21:1.0000:So, each and all, bring flowers, bring flowers, whose
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0352_23:0.9750:From graves of heroes near and far, to scent the very
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_3:0.9750:And smiling Hebe serves for them the banquet of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_8:1.0000:A HANDSOME maiden here at my right hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_9:1.0000:A sonnet for her album doth command.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_10:0.9750:She's trebly handsome ; for, you understand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_11:0.9500:She writes, and has, and is, a handsome Hand.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0353_12:0.9750:To phrase it handsome ; handsome little " Liz "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_2:1.0000:THE gentle lustre of the morning star,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_3:1.0000:The sweet submission in its fading rays
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_4:1.0000:The rising radiance of the golden bar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_5:0.9750:The eastern sky in grayish fields displays :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_6:1.0000:The leaping up from some great sea of fire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_7:0.9750:Of mighty lances of resistless light,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0354_8:0.9750:Betokening the Da3 r -King's fierce desire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_6:0.9750:As through life's pilgrimage we wend ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_7:1.0000:Farewell ! kind guardian of. our souls,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_8:0.9750:Beloved Pastor, guide and friend.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_9:1.0000:Our infant voices gladly join
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_10:1.0000:In grateful blessings, ere we part ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_11:1.0000:And bid thee bear to other scenes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_12:1.0000:The thankful tribute of each heart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_13:1.0000:Thy faithful toil through all the years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_14:1.0000:Here in thy Master's vineyard spent,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_15:1.0000:This hour we linger to recall,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_16:1.0000:With sad and glad emotions blent.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_17:1.0000:And thou, where'er thy lot be cast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_18:1.0000:In sweet remembrances, we know
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_19:1.0000:This consecrated place shalt keep,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_20:1.0000:And us, the friends of days ago.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_21:1.0000:Farewell ! still in thy Lord's employ,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0355_22:1.0000:Elsewhere his message mayst thou bring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_2:1.0000:His grace to seek, His praise to sing.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_3:0.9500:O blessed work, and workman blest !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_4:1.0000:"We bid thee Godspeed on thy way ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_5:1.0000:Glad be thy harvest, late thy rest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_6:1.0000:In realms of everlasting day !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_7:1.0000:And in that day, and in those realms,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_8:1.0000:May we at last together meet ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_9:1.0000:And, at the shining throne of God,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_10:1.0000:Pastor and flock, each other greet.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_11:1.0000:There, as the endless ages roll,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_12:1.0000:May we in radiant splendor shine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_13:1.0000:Among the jewels ransomed souls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0356_14:0.9750:That deck the crown that shall be thine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_5:0.9750:Now let gentle memory lead us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_6:1.0000:While this hour our thoughts recall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_7:1.0000:Forms of loved ones who precede us
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_8:1.0000:Whither we are hastening all.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_9:1.0000:Weak we know our best endeavor,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_10:0.9750:'Gainst the Lethean wave to strive,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_11:0.9500:Still with human fondness ever,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_12:1.0000:Would we keep our dead alive.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_13:1.0000:His behest this hour obeying,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_14:1.0000:Who, for sake of memory dear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_15:1.0000:Crowned an earnest life, essaying
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_16:1.0000:These memorial walls to rear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_17:1.0000:Thus we gather, while we listen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_18:1.0000:To familiar tones of yore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_19:1.0000:And while eyes in sadness glisten,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_20:1.0000:Here to glisten nevermore !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_21:1.0000:Side by side they now are sleeping,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0357_22:1.0000:Sire and daughter, in the tomb ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_1:1.0000:She, in womanhood's first dawning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_2:1.0000:He, of ripe three score and ten,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_3:1.0000:Both lie waiting that bright morning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_4:1.0000:When God's own shall wake again.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_5:0.9750:'Neath the flow'rets o'er them blooming
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_6:0.9750:Summer's verdure, winter's snows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_7:1.0000:Only faith our souls illuming,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_8:1.0000:We must leave them in repose.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_9:1.0000:So, wherever God shall call us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_10:1.0000:Wide world o'er, our lines to cast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_11:1.0000:And whatever fate befall us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_12:1.0000:Death shall claim us all at last !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_13:1.0000:Father, sister, our sad pleasure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_14:0.9750:With fraternal, filial care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_15:1.0000:This fair cenotaph to treasure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_16:0.9750:So its walls your names shall bear ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_17:1.0000:And when loved ones gone before us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_18:1.0000:Wave for us their welcome wands,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_19:1.0000:Each and all, may God restore us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0358_20:0.9500:To the " House not made with hands ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_4:0.9500:KIND friends, we bring you, in a waif of rhyme,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_5:1.0000:A curious story of the olden time.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_6:1.0000:Know then, there lived a hundred years ago,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_7:1.0000:Where yet the Arno, and the Tiber flow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_9:0.9500:Loved ones, and lost, were re-produced at will
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_11:1.0000:By sorcerer's art, to make the dead alive.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_12:1.0000:Tradition adds : it pleased him to discover
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_13:1.0000:This power occult unto a sighing lover,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_15:0.9750:Among angelic beings had a place.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_16:0.9750:So, one by one, within the magic glass,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_17:1.0000:The youth beheld, in bright procession, pass
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_18:1.0000:Beings divine, recalled from their abodes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_19:1.0000:In far-off regions, habited by gods.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_20:1.0000:And, one by one, he saw, but to ignore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_21:1.0000:Until at last, the field of vision o'er
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_22:1.0000:A beauteous image moved ; and on him shone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0359_23:1.0000:A rapturous glance, responsive to his own.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0360_4:1.0000:Once more she calls her idol to her arms !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0360_5:1.0000:Enough : the story hath been briefly told,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0360_6:0.9750:What you have heard your eyes shall now behold !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_6:0.9500:A stranger voice first break the spell, and greet th'
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_8:0.9750:Would some more graceful song than mine, its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_10:1.0000:To bid ye WELCOME, each and all, this glad, auspi-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_11:0.9500:cious night !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_14:0.9750:Within these walls, we trust shall stand thro' many a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_16:1.0000:Almost we know, when he who built, and we and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_17:0.9500:ours are not,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_18:0.9750:This temple still shall crown its site, and beautify
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_20:0.9500:All men are builders ; in their day all men must
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0361_22:0.9750:Of some creation, good or ill, their fellow-men may
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_3:1.0000:To speak for them when passed away, and their own
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_5:0.9750:But, not to court didactic strain I deem his fortune
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_6:0.9500:kind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_7:0.9750:Who, hence departing, haply leaves some monument
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_8:0.9500:behind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_9:0.9500:Built, not to crumble o'er his dust, apart from
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_10:0.9500:haunts of men,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_11:0.9750:But to present him where he wrought, and living
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_13:0.9750:So I regard the rare old man, our neighbor and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_14:1.0000:our friend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_15:0.9500:Whose lot has been, amid these scenes, these fifty
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_16:0.9500:years to spend,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_17:1.0000:And now on soil acquired by toil, in earlier, lustier
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0362_22:0.9500:Which bid us pause, and look behind, and round us,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_3:0.9750:And scan the present, while we strive the future to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_5:0.9750:So, with our aged friend, we take the wings of mem-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_6:0.9500:ory,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_7:0.9750:And almost from its birth o'erlook this nineteenth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_9:0.9500:Behold the quiet bay, where here and there the sail
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_17:0.9500:On the horizon, far away, the eye discerns a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0363_21:0.9750:Again the panorama shifts; a city greets our
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_6:0.9500:the green,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_8:0.9750:scene ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_9:0.9750:Excited suitors help to swell the bustle and the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_10:0.9500:din,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_13:0.9750:Nearer we come, apace with time, until, on every
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_15:0.9500:The palaces of industry the mammoth workshops
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_16:0.9750:stand ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_17:0.9750:A busier aspect everywhere distinguishes the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_21:0.9500:And meanwhile, we begin to note, arise on every
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0364_23:0.9750:Abodes of wealth and luxury, magnificence and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_3:0.9500:Where modest means keep " home, sweet home," and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_5:1.0000:The school-house rears a loftier front ; the church
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_9:0.9750:The Library out-grows its shell ; the city hall looks
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_10:0.9500:gayer,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_11:0.9500:It's " some" to be a councilman ; it's famous to be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_16:0.9750:land's coast.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_17:0.9500:Kind charity opes wide her doors ; the orphan need
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_18:0.9500:not roam,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0365_21:1.0000:The alms-house wears a winsome look ; and often-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_2:0.9500:fail,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_4:0.9500:lightful jail !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_10:0.9750:They've now some sixteen candidates for Alderman,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_12:0.9500:Across the harbor, hope deferred long saw an un-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_13:1.0000:couth ridge ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_14:1.0000:But now it bears symmetric shape, and Bridgeport
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_16:0.9750:Right glad the muse records its birth, and gives it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_18:0.9500:Long may ifc stand, and long defy old Ocean and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0366_20:0.9500:Now, shall we lift the envious veil wherethro' we
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_3:0.9500:Still making the waste place rejoice, and blossom as
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_5:0.9500:Well may we hope, that long as Peace shall hold
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_7:0.9750:And Industry her hosts deploy throughout her vast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_8:0.9500:domain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_9:0.9500:This busy port, so close beside the gateway of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_19:0.9750:We prize it as the builder's gift to us, this festal-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0367_21:0.9500:Here, many and many a year, as generations come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_1:0.9500:Here eloquence shall charm the ear, and melody
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_3:1.0000:While roll the seasons, and when we shall tread
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_8:0.9500:I crave your pardon ; you shall see blithe Ida Vemon
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_9:0.9500:soon;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_10:0.9750:Years gone, 'twas my delight to hear her play " The
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_14:0.9750:Jordan's river ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_15:0.9750:For you; with patriarchal love, he greets your
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0368_17:0.9500:And bids you " Merry Christmas," and a " Happy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_4:1.0000:Dear Brother ! in that far off land,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_5:1.0000:Where last, together, hand in hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_6:1.0000:We stood beside the banks of Rhine.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_7:1.0000:Together, through the storied halls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_8:1.0000:Where Art its lavish treasures brings ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_9:1.0000:Amidst the homes and tombs of kings ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_10:1.0000:Within renowned Cathedral walls,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_11:1.0000:strayed ; until where, grim and hoar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_12:0.9500:Old Heidrlbrrg its tale repeats,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_14:1.0000:We parted, who should meet no more.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_15:1.0000:I know it now, how I did yearn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_16:1.0000:From those loved scenes to bid thee come ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_17:0.9500:And o'er wide ocean bring thee home,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_18:0.9750:Nor speak " Farewell," but plead " Return !"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_20:1.0000:How unto gentle studies wed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0371_21:1.0000:And how by fine ambition led,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_1:1.0000:So, tarrying in that glorious land,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_2:1.0000:Where heavenly music seems foretold,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_3:1.0000:And pours its floods o'er shrines of gold,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_4:1.0000:I gave to thee the parting hand.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_5:1.0000:Since then, with fond fraternal care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_6:1.0000:Expectant of bright days to come,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_7:1.0000:A throne within my own dear home,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_8:1.0000:I've kept for thee the waiting chair.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_10:1.0000:Last litany thou didst repeat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_11:1.0000:Then swift foreran the message sweet, -
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_12:0.9750:The harbinger of glad return.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_13:1.0000:Now in familiar Minster walls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_14:1.0000:The Organ waits thy wizard hands,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_15:1.0000:And tuneful choir, thy skilled commands
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_16:1.0000:To hail the Easter festivals.*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_17:1.0000:My God ! as thunderbolt the shock !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_18:1.0000:Too well I knew that gentle form
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_19:0.9750:Could ne'er withstand the furious storm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0372_20:0.9500:The frenzied wave, the heartless rock.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_1:0.9500:I madly cried : " Can God be good,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_2:1.0000:And grudge that little meed of care
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_3:1.0000:From His Omnipotence ; nor spare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_4:1.0000:My darling from the dastard flood?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_5:1.0000:And He who walked the billowy sea
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_6:1.0000:Aforetime ; and, with shining hand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_7:1.0000:Did wave majestical command,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_8:0.9750:And whisper ' Peace ' on Galilee ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_9:1.0000:Could He not, with benignant arm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_10:1.0000:Uplif t from out that yawning grave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_11:1.0000:One more just one and pitying save
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_12:1.0000:That tender, harmless boy from harm ? "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_13:0.9750:'Tis past, and I am calmer now,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_14:1.0000:As here, upon this moaning shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_15:1.0000:He lies so still ; and bending o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_16:1.0000:I note such calmness on his brow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_17:1.0000:And, in that better " Fatherland,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_19:1.0000:Among the heavenly choirs installed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0373_20:1.0000:An angel's harp is in his hand !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_2:0.9750:WE separate ; the girls and boys divide-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_3:0.9500:Each to a place distinct, or quite alone ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_4:1.0000:Our ruthless passions 'neath the altar hide
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_5:1.0000:The sacrifices, till the hours are flown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_6:0.9750:We hear by chance, in a far distant land,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_8:0.9500:The babes we left, at manhood's portals stand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_9:0.9500:And ah, God help us ! some sweet friends are dead.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_10:1.0000:Then comes a flood of unrestrained grief ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_11:1.0000:Upon our past, our common hours, we dwell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_12:1.0000:Our retrospect is cheated of relief,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_13:1.0000:Remorse encircles like the flames of hell.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0374_14:1.0000:But Heaven will help us ; as we meditate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0375_11:0.9750:I KNEW, I knew these lively chaps would stop at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0375_13:0.9500:Of seeking, in this dreadful strife, the court of last
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0375_15:0.9500:In other words, the court that waits the drainage of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0375_17:0.9500:And then inquires, for all his pranks, how much the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0376_16:0.9750:day,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0382_21:1.0000:A vulgar fraction of what force within his manhood
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_5:0.9750:Philanthropist, with human kind, not merely sym-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_6:0.9500:pathetic,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_7:1.0000:But generous and bountiful, and grandly ener-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_9:0.9750:And last by no means least of all ; and that is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_10:0.9500:why we come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_11:0.9750:Thus heartily to welcome him a lover of his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_13:0.9750:A home that proudly crowns to-day a whilom barren
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_15:0.9750:The triumph and the marvel now of fine aesthetic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_17:0.9750:But prouder monument for him ; within the city's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_19:0.9500:Full many a score of happy habitations may be
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_21:1.0000:Whose owners will not soon forget the prudent head
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_22:0.9500:that planned
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0383_23:1.0000:The homes they ne'er had builded, but for Barnum's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_4:0.9750:his fellow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_7:0.9750:If Barnum hadn't raised, and put wheels under him,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_11:0.9500:Who hoarded all his treasures in old stockings, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_12:0.9500:in trunks,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_13:1.0000:We simply should have set him down a flinty-hearted
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_14:0.9750:sinner,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_15:0.9750:Instead of voting him a " brick " and complimental
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0384_23:1.0000:The qualities that always make the hero and the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_4:0.9500:gather good ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_5:1.0000:And when at last he shall be called to cross the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_7:1.0000:Surviving friends with tearful eyes, beholding him
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_8:0.9500:embark,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_9:0.9750:Shall place his statue, I predict, within the Seaside
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_11:0.9750:And every boy who looks thereon, the record shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_13:0.9500:And learn what steady Yankee pluck and industry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_14:0.9500:can do ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_15:0.9750:And as our city grows apace, an ever crescent
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_17:0.9750:As halo, shall surround her pristine Benefactor's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_19:0.9750:And meanwhile, he'll be ransacking the Universe
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_21:0.9500:And lay a cable through the air from Jupiter to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_22:0.9750:Mars,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0385_23:0.9750:And institute a comet-race, on some tremendous
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0386_3:0.9750:And make an exhibition of the old man in the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0386_11:0.9750:of evil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0386_12:0.9750:Nor rest, till he has raised, reformed, and then EN-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_4:1.0000:It was a Sabbath day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_5:1.0000:To which I call your notice
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_6:0.9750:In sympathetic way.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_7:1.0000:An August sun was shining,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_8:1.0000:In temper most intense ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_9:1.0000:The clock was near defining
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_10:1.0000:When service should commence.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_11:1.0000:At chapel we were greeted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_12:0.9750:My Brother Sam and I,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_13:0.9750:With courtesies, and seated
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_15:1.0000:A stall-pew on the bow aisle,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_16:1.0000:Assigned to us alone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_17:1.0000:Presented us in profile,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_18:1.0000:As victims on a throne !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_19:1.0000:For every waiting creature,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_20:1.0000:Who knew the native sire,*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0387_21:1.0000:On each resembling feature
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_2:1.0000:Concerning how and why
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_3:0.9750:"We were on this inspection,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_6:1.0000:Of mutual sense of woe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_7:1.0000:We kept up our alignment,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_8:1.0000:Well, how I do not know.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_9:1.0000:But there, our fate bemoaning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_10:0.9750:We silently implored
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_11:0.9750:The help the Hector's coming
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_12:0.9750:Would naturally afford.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_13:1.0000:And when the aggregation
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_14:1.0000:Of thoughts we must defy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_16:1.0000:Or some explosive cry ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_18:1.0000:We could have jumped and cheered,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_19:1.0000:At fartherest door a spectre
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_21:1.0000:Forthwith our whole attention
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0388_23:0.9750:The act of apprehension
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_1:1.0000:A tall and slender woman ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_2:1.0000:Not less than seventy-five ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_3:1.0000:Who looked just less than human,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_4:1.0000:And scarcely more 'n alive.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_5:1.0000:She was so slim and bony ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_6:1.0000:The blood so spare in her !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_8:1.0000:For the ancient mariner.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_9:1.0000:Her bodice had descended
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_11:1.0000:But many fashions blended
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_12:1.0000:Throughout her satin dress.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_13:1.0000:A reticule of netting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_15:1.0000:A brooch of oroide setting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_17:1.0000:A climbing ivory jocko
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_18:1.0000:Adorned the shade she lugged ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_19:1.0000:And, bound in red morocco,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_20:0.9750:A prayer-book huge she hugged.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_21:1.0000:In color of the carrot,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_22:0.9750:Her ringlets were aflame ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_23:1.0000:In pattern of the parrot,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0389_24:1.0000:Her nose was much the same.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_1:0.9500:Her eyes were fierce reminders
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_2:0.9750:Of sprite and goblin dreams ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_3:1.0000:Her glasses, flanked by blinders,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_4:1.0000:Were cased in tortoise beams.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_5:1.0000:But speech seems disappearing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_6:0.9750:And memory shrinks with dread,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_7:1.0000:When I approach the gearing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_8:1.0000:She wore upon her head.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_9:1.0000:It was a close-thatched lean-to ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_10:1.0000:It was a prompter's lair ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_11:1.0000:It was a sounding screen to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_12:1.0000:An olden bishop's chair.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_13:1.0000:It was a miller's crater;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_14:1.0000:It was a tavern shed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_15:1.0000:It was a radiator
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_16:0.9750:For gas-lights overhead.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_17:1.0000:It was a Leghorn tunnel,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_18:1.0000:Resembling in degree,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_19:0.9750:The ventilating funnel
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_20:0.9750:Of steamships of the sea.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_21:0.9750:The trimmings on a fraction
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_22:1.0000:Of that stupendous plan,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0390_23:0.9750:Were fit to cause distraction
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_2:1.0000:And slightly up the grade,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_3:1.0000:With spangled gauze upon it,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_4:0.9750:"Were knots of crimson braid.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_5:0.9750:Between these cones upspringing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_6:0.9750:"Were grasses, leaves and stalks ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_7:0.9500:Two blue-jays, couched for singing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_9:1.0000:It was a dreadful vision ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_10:1.0000:Flashed on us all in all,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_11:1.0000:With that acute precision
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_12:1.0000:Most likely to appall.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_13:1.0000:She paused a moment, blocking
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_14:1.0000:That naiTOw doorway ; then
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_15:1.0000:Recovered from the shocking,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_16:1.0000:Our woe began again.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_17:1.0000:She turned her awful awning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_18:1.0000:As she advanced apace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_19:1.0000:And caught us without warning,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_20:1.0000:And held us, face to face.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_21:1.0000:And drawing near the pulpit,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_22:1.0000:Her calcium lights were seen
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_23:1.0000:To blaze on either culprit
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0391_24:0.9500:In incandescence keen !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_1:0.9750:And when in act of kneeling,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_2:1.0000:She still maintained her glare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_3:1.0000:We trembled ; and the feeling
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_4:0.9750:"Was not akin to prayer.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_5:1.0000:And when the verse for quiet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_7:1.0000:" Please read the act for riot ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_8:0.9750:My brother faintly groaned.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_9:1.0000:The fire of our affliction
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_10:1.0000:Abated not a jot ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_11:1.0000:From psalm to benediction
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_12:0.9750:'T was more intensely hot.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_13:1.0000:Full oft a spell mesmeric
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_14:0.9750:"Was fastened on us twain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_15:1.0000:Till on the brink hysteric
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_16:1.0000:I caught my reeling brain.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_17:0.9500:By reverent recitation,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_18:1.0000:By vaulting tricks of thought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_19:0.9750:By back enumeration,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_20:0.9750:Delivery was sought.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_21:1.0000:Perhaps the earnest struggle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_22:1.0000:Had braved the general stare ;-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0392_23:1.0000:But sacred plea, nor juggle,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_2:1.0000:A mockery and a sin ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_4:0.9750:In God's house will begin !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_5:1.0000:Why ended not that session
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_6:1.0000:In ignominious race,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_7:1.0000:Requires a deep confession
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_8:1.0000:Of mystery and grace.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_9:0.9750:Who e'er in judgment sitteth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0393_11:0.9500:" Survival of the fittest,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_2:1.0000:IT glistens not with ruby,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_3:1.0000:Nor flaunts the diamond's glare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_4:1.0000:Nor emerald nor sapphire
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_5:1.0000:Bedecks the ring I wear.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_6:1.0000:Of simple gold 'tis fashioned,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_7:1.0000:And on its sable seal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_8:0.9500:The family initial
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_9:1.0000:Is all it doth reveal.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_10:1.0000:Yet not a gem that sparkles
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_11:1.0000:Afar on India's strand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_12:1.0000:Or blazes on imperial brow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_13:1.0000:Or proudly sceptered hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_14:1.0000:So precious a memento,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_15:1.0000:So priceless boon could be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_16:1.0000:As you shall know, but listen,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_17:1.0000:This bauble is to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_18:0.9750:Within the Palais Royal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_19:1.0000:For seeming miles ablaze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_20:0.9750:As fabulous Aladdin's
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_21:1.0000:To court the 'wildered gaze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_22:1.0000:He told us he had bought it,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0394_23:0.9750:With reverent desire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_1:0.9500:To wear it as a token
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_2:1.0000:In memory of his sire.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_3:1.0000:And so he kept and wore it ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_4:1.0000:I saw it on him last,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_5:1.0000:As o'er the keys of melody
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_6:1.0000:His fingers deftly passed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_7:1.0000:As rolled the swelling volume
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_8:1.0000:Of sound, my eyes grew dim ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_9:1.0000:I wept to see the signet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_10:0.9750:But not not then for him !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_11:1.0000:Alas ! within a twelve-month,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_12:1.0000:On that disastrous shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_13:1.0000:Whose very rocks are shedding
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_14:0.9750:Their tears forevermore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_15:1.0000:Brave ship and base commander
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_16:0.9750:Rushed fearfully awreck,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_17:1.0000:And fearfully and wildly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_18:1.0000:Rushed hundreds to the deck !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_19:1.0000:And shivering and shuddering,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_20:1.0000:In darkness, cold and storm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_21:1.0000:Amid that doomed assemblage
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_22:1.0000:There stood our poor boy's form ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_23:1.0000:And as he leaped in horror
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0395_24:0.9500:And vain hope to withstand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_1:0.9500:The mocking waves that clasped him,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_2:1.0000:This ring was on his hand !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_3:0.9750:Far down within the caverns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_4:1.0000:Drear tenements of death,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_5:1.0000:To note the last pulsation,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_6:1.0000:The last expiring breath ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_7:1.0000:Forever mute, mute witness !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_8:1.0000:Thou knowest, but dost spare
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_9:1.0000:Those tales hads't thou but language-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_10:1.0000:Of heart-break and despair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_11:1.0000:Kude hands from out those caverns,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_12:1.0000:The precious corse upbore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_13:1.0000:And tenderly disposed it
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_14:1.0000:Upon the pitying shore.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_15:0.9750:Kind strangers and survivors
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_16:1.0000:Saved all for us with care ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_17:1.0000:All, all they could his body,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_18:1.0000:This ring ; a lock of hair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_19:1.0000:The months have flown and vanished,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_20:1.0000:And in the haunts of men
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_21:1.0000:I move, and ofttimes gaily
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_22:1.0000:Discourse with tongue or pen ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_23:1.0000:But sadness, like a shadow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0396_24:0.9500:In night-watch and alone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_2:1.0000:And claims me for its own,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_3:0.9750:And sometimes, as, abstracted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_4:1.0000:I gaze upon this ring,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_5:1.0000:The home of childhood re-appears,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_6:1.0000:The scenes of life's bright spring :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_7:0.9750:Sire, mother, sisters, brothers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_8:1.0000:Gone hence beyond the sky ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_9:1.0000:I feel we all must meet again,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_10:1.0000:I almost long to die.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_11:1.0000:It glistens not with ruby,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_12:1.0000:Nor flaunts the diamond's glare,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_15:1.0000:Yet naught so dear memento,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_16:1.0000:So priceless boon could be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_17:1.0000:As this sad tale hath told you
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0397_18:0.9750:This bauble is to me.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0398_6:1.0000:Who gives a moment's heed to what my lips and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0398_7:0.9750:looks express ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0398_9:0.9500:brother,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0398_17:1.0000:The branches couldn't find the root, or trace their

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_3:0.9750:A bridge across the paltry years, and we are all the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_5:0.9500:And here, according naught but love to Kaiser or
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_7:1.0000:We work new problems, whose results are with the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_9:0.9750:So, starting with our brotherhood, I think we can

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_22:0.9500:is done!"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0399_23:0.9500:A mound upon the globe's expanse, which other-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_3:0.9750:Cathedrals, builded to enshrine sarcophagi of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_5:0.9500:Tombs, so renowned, that in their midst, in royal

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_7:1.0000:What Albion's son, but craves the boon deservingly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_9:0.9500:And statues, that commemorate their ever deathless
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_11:0.9750:And castles hoar, with amaranthine memories o'er-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_13:1.0000:And palaces, within whose courts earth's noblest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_14:0.9750:ones have stood,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_15:1.0000:And towers, whose moated battlements have soaked
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_17:0.9500:But no effete, decaying realm evokes our laudful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_19:1.0000:Within her bounds to-day, what homes of wealth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0401_21:0.9750:What industry, what enterprise, throughout her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0402_1:0.9500:Wliat commerce, at her teeming ports, awaits each
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0402_3:1.0000:What network o'er her fair expanse, of highway and

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0402_13:1.0000:And note a thousand things, his every school-boy

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0403_15:0.9750:The tocsin of the Cockney's soul sweet, musical
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0403_19:0.9750:But speak for English gold in every corner of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0403_20:0.9500:earth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_3:0.9750:Innumerable multitudes, like waves and billows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_5:0.9750:And rampant men and rampant steeds contend with
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_6:0.9750:mad uproar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_9:0.9500:And farther east O let us pause with vision rapt
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_10:0.9750:awhile !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_11:0.9750:In seeming isolation there, looms up that sombre
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_13:1.0000:Long time the seat of kingly pride, and kingly lust
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_14:0.9750:and power
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_15:0.9750:It stands, with walls whose very stones do seem to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_19:0.9500:Whose myriad chimneys belch their flames, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0404_20:0.9500:smoky clouds unfold;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0405_3:1.0000:To sing all night, I couldn't turn a neater verse than
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0405_4:0.9500:that;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0405_5:0.9750:Shake hands all round ! bring cakes and ale ; this
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0406_4:0.9750:I KNOW precisely what you want : you thought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0406_10:0.9750:I was fledged,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0406_11:0.9750:And hung my hopeful shingle out, seductively gilt-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_2:0.9750:trious story,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_3:1.0000:Shall I cull out, most redolent, the roses of your
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_4:0.9500:glory?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_5:1.0000:I read the faithful record o'er with wonder and

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_18:1.0000:The gentle scholar, born to tread serener paths to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0407_19:0.9500:fame ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_1:0.9750:Of simon-pure Colonial stock, the bright, consum-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_9:0.9750:Not unreinembered, do our hearts go proudly forth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_11:1.0000:And yield their throbbing benisons above their hal-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_13:0.9750:Go now with me, where'er the shock of battle rends
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_15:0.9500:Aloft, defiant, you shall see the tri-vined banner
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_17:0.9500:The first unfurled at New Orleans, and waving in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_18:0.9500:the blast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_19:0.9500:Its saucy folds at Bull Run, o'er the first gun and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_21:0.9500:The first on Mississippi's soil ; the first to kiss the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0408_23:0.9500:Beneath the " sacred shadows " of the staid pal-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_3:0.9750:The gentry cried, " they come ; great guns ! the nut-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_10:0.9750:flag went down,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_11:1.0000:To leap triumphant o'er its walls, and greet the cap-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_12:1.0000:tured town !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_14:0.9750:fore
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_15:0.9500:Had shone, emblazoned, deathless deeds of patriot
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_16:0.9750:men of yore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_17:0.9750:O, Mother of a glorious race, whose loyalty, the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_18:0.9750:same
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_19:1.0000:Through all the years, could only add fresh laurels
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_21:0.9500:And now, a grander spectacle, to all the earth we
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0409_23:0.9500:As, in the peaceful walks of life, once more we come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_3:1.0000:And whilom foemen gladly meet as brothers of lang
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_4:0.9750:syne!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_5:1.0000:The dream is past ; so let it fade ; the hideous,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_7:0.9750:The night is o'er ; so let us hail the morning's rose-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_8:1.0000:ate gleam.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0410_9:0.9750:O'er all the land once more behold the starry flag
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_7:0.9750:And wake, this hour, the memories of other days and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_8:0.9500:times ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_9:1.0000:Of days and times since first we saw this newly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_14:1.0000:Aglow with hope, alert with zeal, assured of ripen-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_18:1.0000:By charms that could but half reveal the lovelier
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_19:0.9750:soul within.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_20:0.9500:It was a gladsome spectacle ; the future seemed so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_21:0.9750:fair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0411_22:1.0000:And life was all rose-color then unto the youthful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_3:0.9500:As, 'neath the fav'ring smiles of Heaven, we witness
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_7:0.9500:That all, and more, is realized, than early hope fore-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_9:0.9500:And bride and groom, we dare to say, as swift years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_10:0.9500:have flown o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_11:0.9500:Have learned to honor and to love each other more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_13:0.9500:We know the charm of youthful hope I mean, we
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_14:1.0000:" old folks" do,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_17:0.9500:But Hope stands always at the prow, and holds
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_18:0.9500:more sure command,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_19:1.0000:When brave FRUITION sits astern, and lends a help-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_21:1.0000:The youth and maid could promise fair ; of course,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_22:0.9500:they always do ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0412_23:0.9750:But time alone can tell if they shall keep their

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_6:0.9500:culiar pride,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_7:0.9750:As five-and-twenty years have sped, we greet this
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_9:0.9750:And as we note how pleasantly their wedded lives
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_11:1.0000:Pronounce with hearty joy the benedictive words,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_12:0.9500:" well done ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_13:0.9750:No doubt they've had their small disputes ; no doubt,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_15:0.9750:They each may now and then have had a " contrary

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_21:0.9750:Perhaps, sometimes, he thought he felt a spasm of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0413_23:1.0000:At figures, for what seemed to him a quite superflu-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_3:1.0000:And he was ready to agree " she never looked so
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_9:0.9750:That while he seemed to have his way, she always

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_13:1.0000:That she, a fifteen-summers bride, was " handsomer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_14:1.0000:than ever ;"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_15:0.9500:And now, she is so very old, it cStnnot make her vain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_19:0.9500:not dim,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_20:1.0000:Our muse embodied in her song, some pleasant
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_21:0.9500:things of him.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0414_22:0.9750:He keeps on growing, and revolves in more ex-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_6:0.9750:pious joy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_8:0.9500:your darling boy !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_9:0.9500:And now it but remains to add, in some befitting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_11:0.9500:Kind wishes that a favoring sun illume the coming
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_13:0.9500:That peacefully and prosperously the stream of life
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_15:0.9750:And in the self same strain we sang, so many

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_21:0.9750:Ere at life's even you shall stand, inspired by mem-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_22:0.9500:ories olden,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_23:0.9750:To join each faithful hand with hand, in nuptials
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0415_24:0.9750:that are golden.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0416_5:1.0000:And join that august shining throng, before the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_4:1.0000:At such a dreadful lapse of time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_5:0.9500:A quarter of a century,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_6:1.0000:To string the olden beads of rhyme ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_7:1.0000:Indeed, it were a fruitless task,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_8:1.0000:You know not, lady, what you ask.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_9:1.0000:For I am older, staider grown ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_10:1.0000:My face betrays the weight of care ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_11:1.0000:And close beside each temporal bone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_12:1.0000:Behold the streaks of silver hair !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_13:1.0000:I'm sorry, but it must be told,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_14:1.0000:The dismal truth ; I'm growing old !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_15:1.0000:And yet, not cold ; for now, indeed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_16:1.0000:As on thy blithesome face I gaze,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_17:1.0000:As on some luminous page, I read
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_18:1.0000:The memories of those halcyon days.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_19:1.0000:Old flames rekindle, and in sooth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_20:1.0000:I feel the glorious thrill of youth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_21:0.9750:And, oh 1 how gently hath the hand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0417_22:1.0000:Of time upon thy brow been laid ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_2:1.0000:Days more of sunshine than of shade.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_3:1.0000:Thou same bright, sparkling, saucy " Joe "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_6:0.9750:Through years and years to come, be thine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_7:0.9500:With mellow softness o'er thee steal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_8:1.0000:Anon the rays of life's decline ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_9:1.0000:Till, this thine earthly season past
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0418_10:1.0000:Thou shalt o'erlook the stars at last.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_3:1.0000:The type of health, the soul of truth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_4:1.0000:His widowed mother often sighed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_5:1.0000:With thoughts of woe and hopes of pride,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_6:1.0000:As sire in son she more descried.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_7:1.0000:And oft the gossips' chatter ran,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_8:1.0000:That John could choose when once a man.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_9:1.0000:A hearty, gleeful, hoyden girl,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_10:0.9500:John's pet playmate, Catharine Earl.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_11:1.0000:Next neighbors, and alike in age ;

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_13:1.0000:By Catharine's father, saint and sage.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_14:1.0000:And each, in memory's earliest year,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_15:1.0000:Had followed at a parent's bier.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_16:1.0000:And every tie which childhood knows

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_19:1.0000:As children they had often played
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_20:1.0000:In garden, grove, and brookside glade ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_21:1.0000:Where now, beneath the moon they told
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_22:1.0000:The never-new and never-old,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0419_23:1.0000:The nonsense lovers will repeat,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0422_7:0.9750:Not all possessed the hardihood the venturous deed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0422_8:1.0000:to dare ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0422_13:0.9750:Just north, with Castle street between, a building
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0422_15:0.9750:Where, it was said that all the needs of life were at

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0422_17:0.9750:You could be born there, go to school, keep store,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0423_3:1.0000:To make me sit amongst the girls. (She thought

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0423_22:0.9500:longed to pay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_2:0.9750:dors and halls,

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_4:0.9750:its walls.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_5:0.9750:An old sign, in the garret stowed, the information
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_8:0.9500:years before ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_9:0.9750:And numerous are the legends yet, the fancy to in-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_12:0.9500:that bar-room fire.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_13:0.9750:The timbers proved exceeding staunch, and when

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0424_23:0.9750:A decent structure in its time, its white front crowned

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0425_10:0.9500:flame,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0425_11:0.9750:So, down town, through the " Locos' " act, the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_5:1.0000:Somewhat, I know, of fond regret, in each breast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_7:0.9750:That morning, when the old church bowed to earth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_8:0.9500:its battered spire ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_9:1.0000:The upturned faces of that throng my mind is pic-

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_12:0.9750:wet!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_17:1.0000:Where, all your days, ye natives born, ye have been
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_18:0.9500:wont to find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0426_19:0.9750:So much to feed the hungry soul, and mould and

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0427_3:1.0000:On every hand, what monuments to dead and living
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0427_5:0.9750:The church, the school, the library, the factory, the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0427_7:1.0000:The telegraph, the railway train, the bridge, the

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0439_5:0.9500:And there we had our daily tasks, our daily sports,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0439_9:0.9750:And we were taught in gracious ways, that we can

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0443_8:1.0000:So we may voice the sentiments which to the hour

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0443_18:0.9750:New mile-stones to uprear along the vast highway

sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0446_19:1.0000:Some maid's fond lover ; wife's fond spouse ; some
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0446_20:0.9500:mother's cherished son !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0446_23:1.0000:The unrevealed biographies of angels shall un-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_4:1.0000:Eternally the records of true womanhood shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_8:1.0000:As at her cottage door a dame sat knitting in her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_9:0.9500:chair ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_12:0.9500:In one brave charge at Gettysburg, fell dead before
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_14:0.9750:A fourth son holds judicial seat ; while yet another
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_18:0.9500:She only waits in God's good time, His rich rewards
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_20:0.9750:So there she sits, serenely sad, and knitting in her
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0447_22:0.9750:Throughout the years since waged the war, some
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_3:1.0000:In each breast wells the sentiment "Ye faithful
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_5:0.9750:And now, outlooking on the sea that clasps the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_7:1.0000:Defiant of the shocks of time, that glorious form
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_8:0.9500:shall stand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_9:0.9750:With outstretched arm, magnificent, the laurel to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_11:0.9750:On heroes whose bright names adorn the lettered
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_13:0.9750:Our soldier boy, with form erect, shall greet each
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_15:0.9750:Our sailor watch the gorgeous west, as every day is
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_18:0.9750:sword that gave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_19:0.9750:To her true life, the while it broke the shackles of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_21:1.0000:They tell us, in the not remote, nor doubtful by-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_22:0.9500:and-by,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0448_23:0.9750:Along these shores, the most majestic argosies shall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_5:0.9500:Then, from their decks, the emigrant alike, and ti-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_6:0.9500:tled guest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_7:0.9750:As, gazing from the starboard side, their curious
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_8:1.0000:eyes shall rest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_9:0.9750:On fair Columbia's shore, among its crowning roofs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_10:0.9750:and towers,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_12:0.9750:nel of ours ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_13:0.9500:And learn, ere yet their feet have pressed the hospi-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_17:0.9750:And feel impatient haste to touch the soil of Yankee
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_19:0.9500:And hear a hearty Yankee voice, and grasp a Yan-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_20:0.9750:kee hand !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_21:0.9750:Here shall the beauteous fabric stand, as seasons
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0449_23:0.9500:Reflect the summer's sun, and wear its wintry robes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_3:1.0000:Allure the birds to gather round, and build their
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_5:0.9750:The boys, in mimic soldier-garb, shall here make
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_7:0.9750:The yachts do glad obeisance as they toss within the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_8:0.9750:bay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_9:1.0000:And children hold their festivals close by, within the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_11:1.0000:And plighted ones stroll here at eve to whisper words
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_15:0.9500:Bring oft their groups to view these forms, and read
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_16:0.9500:these names again ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_17:0.9750:And music, chiming with the waves, shall wake melo-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_18:0.9500:dious air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_19:0.9500:And twilight offer respite here to daily toil and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_20:0.9500:care.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_21:1.0000:And so the sure years shall revolve; and when,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_22:0.9500:amidst the dead,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0450_23:0.9750:On humbler tablets, here and there, our own names
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0451_3:0.9750:If lips unborn shall bid us share the tribute of their
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0451_7:0.9750:How better than material good is the sweet wealth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0451_8:0.9500:of love ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0451_10:0.9500:haviour,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0451_11:0.9750:As makes us more akin to God, and to the gentle
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_4:1.0000:IN these emphatic and tumultuous days,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_5:1.0000:When sins are to the lowest scale deplored,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_6:1.0000:Or favor strained in every term of praise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_7:1.0000:As ladies' notes are largely underscored ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_10:1.0000:And riot is assumed the mode to teach
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_11:1.0000:That Charity which pardons and forgets !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_17:1.0000:To fierce superlatives are raised and wrought,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_18:1.0000:And old poetic types of joys and woes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_19:1.0000:Are dwarfed by new hyperboles of prose ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0452_20:0.9750:In short, when modern heat of temper and of tone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_1:0.9500:Destroyed the climate of a tempered zone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_2:1.0000:To substitute the torrid and intense :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_3:1.0000:How can we hope our set and sober theme
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_4:1.0000:Will marked attention and respect invite,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_5:1.0000:When in imperfect phrase we tell a scheme
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_6:0.9750:That needs no plea, that seeks no proselyte ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_7:0.9750:Yet may we sing, though our admonished muse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_8:1.0000:Itself proclaim the critic's chosen wrong,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_9:1.0000:And seem, at first, to question and accuse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_10:1.0000:For faults which title all the following song.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_11:0.9750:Hail, mighty Sun ! that gladdens into morn
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_12:1.0000:The hours that date the instituting birth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_13:0.9500:Of this Grand Order, whose design was born
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_15:0.9500:Hail ! men in bonds to fellowship and truth !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_16:1.0000:United by the dying, o'er the dead ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_17:0.9750:Or, having passed the discipline of youth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_19:0.9500:Hail ! blessed memories, which the day invest !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_20:0.9500:Not heard in story, nor explained by creeds :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_21:1.0000:Though hidden, yet the Ciphers which suggest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0453_22:1.0000:Form choral alphabets of friendly deeds.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_1:0.9750:Welcome the year ! for which ye now, anew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_2:1.0000:Repeat your vows to sacred toil and strife,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_3:1.0000:And pledge the glory of the Past's review
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_4:1.0000:In ample token of a higher life.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_5:1.0000:What summons bid these goodly men repair,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_6:1.0000:With obvious pleasure and enlightened zeal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_7:1.0000:To upper chambers which with ritual care,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_8:0.9750:Are ope'd by signs, and closed with secret seal.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_9:1.0000:No public heralding the stated hour,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_10:1.0000:No printed words the usual objects tell ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_11:1.0000:No sect seductions wield attractive power :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_12:1.0000:The finest chapel and the sweetest bell ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_13:0.9750:The loveliest shepherd of the wealthiest flock ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_14:0.9750:The largest gathering of the worldly great ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_15:1.0000:The church, where simple purchasers of stock
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_16:0.9750:In weekly mourning humbly congregate ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_17:1.0000:None such as these appeal or motive lend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_19:0.9500:For he who enters must be vouched a friend ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_20:0.9750:Who gains the grasp need only be a Man.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_21:1.0000:Though doubly sentineled and barred the gates
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0454_22:0.9750:Of Temples which our Order rears and rules,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_2:1.0000:Without the portals of the Vestibules.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_6:0.9500:With helpful grief is heard the Orphan's wail !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_7:1.0000:The trophies of great battle triumphs bring
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_8:0.9750:And fill the museums for a nation's pride ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_9:1.0000:As they are gathered let the welkin ring
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_10:0.9750:With songs which desperate threatenings defied.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_11:1.0000:Raise high the pedestals, in park and town,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_12:1.0000:Whereon the Hero's marble form may stand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_13:1.0000:To mark and to perpetuate renown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_14:1.0000:For love and service to a glorious land.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_15:0.9750:Adorn each capitol's rotunda space
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_16:1.0000:With paintings of bright deeds for Freedom's home.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_17:1.0000:And crown the champion of an age or race
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_18:1.0000:Upon the summit of the soaring dome !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_19:0.9750:But where the earthly monuments of those
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_20:0.9750:Save they have built an alms-house for their fame
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_21:1.0000:Whose labor to relieve the common woes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0455_22:0.9500:In worldly walks had reaped a mighty name ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_1:0.9750:And even though the costly Mural gave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_2:1.0000:A truthful tale of duty without price,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_3:0.9750:The stolen hymn that marks each villain's grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_5:0.9500:And where the prizes Charity has gained
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_6:1.0000:In Misery's scenes, which her apostles trod ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_7:0.9750:Intangible her trophies else profaned
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_8:1.0000:The honor and the husbandry of God !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_9:1.0000:There is no history for the mortal eye,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_10:0.9750:There is no shaft that smites the distant cloud,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_11:0.9750:Graven or raised with grace to testify
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_12:0.9500:Of kindred acts which Heaven's blest vaults en-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_13:0.9500:shroud.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_16:0.9750:Where bloody tragedy ^ audacious theft,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_17:1.0000:And homes of peace connubial bereft,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_18:1.0000:Whatever verdict partial juries take,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_19:1.0000:By natural laws are bound a book to make,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_21:0.9500:But to relieve the parent's plethoric purse ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0456_22:1.0000:Wliere little girls to debauchees are tied,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_2:0.9750:With each new bonnet change their wedded name,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_3:1.0000:And, pitying, view those left by them in lurch
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_4:1.0000:Their poorer sisters of the self-same church
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_5:1.0000:Who, it would seem quite rational to fear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_7:1.0000:Where politicians sneer at moral worth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_8:1.0000:As not related to official birth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_9:0.9500:Where candidates long hanker on the shelves ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_10:0.9750:Where snobs and loafers satirize themselves ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_11:1.0000:Where wretches known to be in guilt so deep
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_12:1.0000:That angels vainly for their souls might weep ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_13:0.9750:To tenderest passions mournfully appeal,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_14:1.0000:And picture love and truths they never feel ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_15:1.0000:Out from their pits of sensual blackness run
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_16:1.0000:Their fiery cars of rhetoric to the sun !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_18:1.0000:Affect the courage of an Ishmaelite ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_19:1.0000:Where money-sharks relentless prey, and then
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_20:1.0000:Are epitheted, "First-rate business men ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_21:1.0000:Where sordid self is potentate and rule ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_22:1.0000:Who gives for friendship is an arrant fool !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0457_23:1.0000:Where scarce relieved frivolity prevails ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_1:1.0000:How can you think to organize a plan
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_2:1.0000:That shall retain its working skill and power
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_3:0.9750:To cheer the heart and meet the wants of man ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_4:0.9500:Without a startling tocsin for each hour ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_5:1.0000:Thy neighbors' dangers and thine own attend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_6:0.9750:On every moment, threatening every breath !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_9:0.9750:When great catastrophe occurs, and calls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_10:1.0000:For special contributions and relief ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_11:0.9750:When fearful carnage all the land appalls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_12:1.0000:And moves the coldest to a generous grief *,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_13:0.9750:Abundant means for succor are obtained ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_14:0.9750:Ten thousand hands, gratuitous, extend
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_15:1.0000:To help, till life and peace once more are gained,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_16:1.0000:And dreadful memories to the Past descend.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_17:1.0000:But, in the callous or indifferent world,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_18:1.0000:When quiet broods upon the social face ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_19:0.9750:When all are not in shocks of sorrow whirled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_20:0.9750:How find and soothe the miseries of the race ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_21:0.9500:This greatest precept must be held in view
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0458_22:0.9750:Given by the Father to the perfect Son :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_2:1.0000:In secret service let the work be done !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_3:0.9750:Strip from the Symphony the vulgar rhyme
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_5:0.9750:How clear the soul lifts with the swelling chime !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_6:0.9750:How purely thrills the music, harped or sung!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_7:0.9750:Music ! Th' Etherial, and the Undefiled !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_8:1.0000:The heart and utterance of celestial truth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_9:1.0000:Revealing in its innocence a child ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_10:1.0000:Its beauteons strength portraying sinless youth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_11:0.9750:So man : weak, vain, when nurtured with pretense ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_12:1.0000:If private hour and fellow mortal's needs
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_13:1.0000:Conspire to drive each earthly impulse hence,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_14:1.0000:May execute the unpolluted deeds !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_15:1.0000:Deeds of redemption ; though the Judge devotes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_16:0.9750:All other actions to comsuming fire
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_17:0.9750:Changed by celestial alchemy to notes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0459_19:0.9750:Aye ! Deeds that shall be celebrated when
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_2:0.9750:IT was a sightly funeral train,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_3:1.0000:The undertaker man,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_4:0.9750:With coffin-faced solemnity,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_5:1.0000:Conspicuous, led the van.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_6:1.0000:The priest, with comely garb and mien,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_7:1.0000:Sate, reverent, at his side ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_8:1.0000:Then came the hearse, whose stately plumes
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_9:0.9750:Bespoke a solemn pride.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_11:0.9750:Seemed manifest displayed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_12:1.0000:And kerchief d eyes would fain shut out
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_13:0.9500:Observance and parade.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_15:0.9750:Of sorrow and distress ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_16:0.9750:Then " Number Three" : appearances
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_17:0.9750:Of partial listlessness.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_18:1.0000:But curious ; the occupants
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_19:0.9750:Of carriage " Number Four,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_20:1.0000:Yawned, as to vote the whole affair
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_21:1.0000:A ceremonious bore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0460_22:1.0000:But, "Five," " Six," " Seven," made amends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_2:0.9500:The journey to beguile.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_3:0.9750:But vastly worse our truthful muse
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_4:1.0000:Would hardly dare to state,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_5:1.0000:Were not these verses based on fact
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_6:0.9750:The scenes in " Number Eight ;"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_7:0.9750:Where two gay youths and two fair maids
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_8:1.0000:Were visibly diverting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_9:1.0000:Their minds from the solemnities,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_10:1.0000:By levity, and flirting.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_11:0.9750:And then behold in "Number Nine,"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_12:1.0000:A scene transcending far,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_13:1.0000:All we have chronicled as yet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_14:0.9750:Four men, each with cigar ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_15:0.9750:A robe upon their knees outspread,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_16:1.0000:Suspicious flask and cup,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_18:0.9500:By playing " seven up 1"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_19:1.0000:Then, in the last conveyance, rode
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_20:1.0000:The female we all know,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0461_21:0.9750:Who never lets occasion pass,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0462_1:1.0000:And weeps and sobs, until the sight
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0462_2:1.0000:Is pitiful to see,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0462_3:0.9750:And then inquires, as nears the grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_4:1.0000:High up the full-orbed moon was shining,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_5:1.0000:As I, glad that our port was near,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_6:1.0000:Upon the capstan was reclining,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_7:1.0000:Spying the sea, and backward thinking,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_8:0.9750:Such was my wont when watching nights ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_9:0.9750:From future thoughts persistent shrinking,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_10:0.9750:As never yielding old delights.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_11:1.0000:Alone my solace in the past,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_12:1.0000:Through all the hours of toil and care :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_13:0.9750:The morrow's sky was overcast
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_14:1.0000:With clouds whose depths I could not dare.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_15:1.0000:The sailor's thoughts of home were sweet ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_16:1.0000:Though late in life he learned their truth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_17:1.0000:He prayed that he in Heaven might meet
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_18:1.0000:The first companions of his youth.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_19:1.0000:How the dear scenes passed in review,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_20:1.0000:Pictures of gold he pondered o'er !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_21:0.9750:How far beyond all price they grew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0463_22:1.0000:As he repeated, " nevermore I "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_1:1.0000:And yet there was no mean repining,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_2:1.0000:No sickly yearning for the lost ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_3:1.0000:Those tender memories interlining
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_4:1.0000:Life's record, cheat it of its cost.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_5:1.0000:With pain at times we throw them by,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_6:1.0000:But soon return, when 'tis revealed
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_7:1.0000:That in those shades which never die
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_8:1.0000:The actual substance is concealed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_9:0.9750:It was not fear or shame that filled
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_10:1.0000:My soul, when forward it might look,:
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_11:1.0000:An " undefined presence " chilled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_12:1.0000:And cursed the prospect I forsook.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_13:1.0000:But now, why should I try evade
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_14:1.0000:So close the Fleet "Wing's harbor lay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_15:1.0000:Keflections, which before forbade
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_16:1.0000:The simplest comfort on my way ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_17:1.0000:Eight bells struck aft ; upon relief
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_18:1.0000:I did not join the crew below ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_19:1.0000:Their hearts with joy, as mine with grief,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_20:1.0000:Unreasonable bounds o'erflow.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_21:1.0000:Beneath the boats I made my bed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0464_22:0.9750:Hid from the moon's destructive beams ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_1:0.9500:Again the earliest pages read,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_2:1.0000:And gained the quiet boyhood dreams.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_3:1.0000:What is this strangely following sight ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_4:0.9500:"What blessed Angels walk before ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_5:1.0000:Kepeat the day, dispel the night,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_6:1.0000:And make me anxious for the shore ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_7:1.0000:Almost a copy for the time
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_8:1.0000:That I had held in such esteem,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_9:1.0000:Hope for its likeness seemed a crime,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_11:1.0000:With me such unbelief remained,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_12:0.9750:Against its haunting force I strove ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_13:0.9500:But constantly it was sustained,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_14:0.9750:With every calculation wove.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_15:0.9500:Four times the Farallones we made ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_16:1.0000:Three times the lights flashed on the lee ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_17:1.0000:Four times the winds opposing staid,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_18:1.0000:And drove us to the open sea.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_19:1.0000:What curious passions fill my mind !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_20:1.0000:Now they depress and now elate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0465_21:0.9750:When after five long months we find
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_1:0.9750:And here begins the wondrous choice ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_2:1.0000:And here commenced prophetic days :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_4:1.0000:I recognized the city's ways.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_5:1.0000:With utmost faithfulness, each part
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_6:1.0000:Of hour and day disclosed the fact
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_7:1.0000:"Which I had written on my heart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_8:0.9750:Foreshadowed, and fulfilled exact.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_9:0.9500:The old New England home, once more !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_10:1.0000:The welcome, and the cheerful fire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_11:1.0000:Contrasted suffering, than before
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_12:1.0000:A keener relish must inspire.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_13:1.0000:But ah ! the vision failed to tell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_14:0.9750:Of her, whose beauty soon destroys
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_15:1.0000:The peace of life, I loved so well ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_16:1.0000:A deeper hope my soul employs.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_17:1.0000:With unaffected ease she spoke
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_18:1.0000:Of mutually familiar friends :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_19:1.0000:The memories her words evoke
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_20:1.0000:A cherished possible transcends.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_21:1.0000:I lent to her my favorite books,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0466_22:1.0000:And proved our tastes alike inclined :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_1:0.9750:Forgetting e'en her charming looks,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_2:0.9750:In her enchanting grace of mind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_4:1.0000:The story of the Dream 's complete.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_5:1.0000:'T was fully true, save nought of one !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_6:1.0000:If a revealing trance repeat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0467_7:1.0000:And finish what was thus begun ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_5:0.9750:I'M no farmer ; not a syllable from lips of mine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_10:0.9500:The acquaintances of years ago, the neighbors of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_12:0.9750:And 'tis singular I came to sing, but all things
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_14:0.9750:Olden tunes come wafted to my ear from every rock
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_15:0.9750:and tree ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_16:0.9500:And I seem but echo, as I stand within this native
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_18:0.9750:And each object in the landscape round repeats an
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_20:0.9750:But how things have changed ! go back with me the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0468_22:0.9500:To the time when this good enterprise began with
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_4:0.9500:First arrived in town that day, and brought its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_6:0.9500:And the " show" was scattered all around, a little
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_12:1.0000:While along the street were improvised seductive
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_14:0.9500:O, let modern cookery essay its best exploits in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_16:0.9500:For those oysters, and that gingerbread we'll never
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0469_23:0.9500:To invest in those bivalvous plants, and buy that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_3:1.0000:Peddled sweets and peanuts to the folks who came
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_5:0.9500:I remember, to the rearward of the stone church
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_6:0.9750:used to stand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_7:1.0000:Half a dozen gorgeous wagons, with their fancy
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_8:0.9500:goods on hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_9:1.0000:And some very flippant orators their merchandise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_11:1.0000:O'er-persuading by their eloquence, the rustic pass-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_14:0.9500:tioneer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_15:0.9750:Whom I knew I might anticipate with each return-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_17:0.9750:Whose financial sacrifices, if the half he said was
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_20:1.0000:* put him through !'
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_21:0.9500:Then, the man who showed the learned pig, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0470_23:1.0000:And the cripple, who displayed the ball that knock-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_3:0.9750:Who could cleanse your coat or conscience from a
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_7:0.9500:Something over seventy years of age, walked proud
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_9:0.9500:While before, at least a hundred stalwart oxen were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_13:0.9750:And in front of all, surrounded by enthusiastic
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_15:0.9750:That new village brass band vexed the air with com-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_17:0.9750:And escorted all the people, to the semblances of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_19:0.9750:To the meeting where should be dispensed the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0471_21:0.9500:From beginnings such as these, the institution
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_3:1.0000:As, through many a year, as I recall, I played the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_5:0.9750:What intense debates we used to have, when first
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_7:0.9750:Some distinctive habitation for our purpose to ac-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_9:1.0000:And how many croakers shook their heads, and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_11:0.9750:Who shall find their sage prognostications all at
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_12:0.9500:fault to-day !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_13:1.0000:And now what an educator this emprise hath proved
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_15:0.9750:Looking back a generation, what results we come to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_17:0.9750:Better farms and better mansions, better harvests
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_18:0.9750:now than then ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_19:1.0000:Better quadrupeds and bipeds, brighter women,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_22:0.9500:as we go,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0472_23:0.9500:And each tributary makes the river grander in its
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_3:0.9750:In the century that's coming, who shall venture to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_5:0.9500:In that wondrous exhibition, now surprising all the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_9:0.9500:Unto patient Labor wedded, as together, hand in
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_10:0.9750:hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_11:1.0000:They have cultured all the planet and embellished
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_15:1.0000:In the onward march of progress, all contesting for
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_18:0.9500:vance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0473_23:0.9500:In the world's confederation, each a mission to ful-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_3:0.9750:With a pride we all forgive her, shows the trophies
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_5:0.9750:Unto all of these according, as we do, the meed of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_7:0.9500:How our own beloved Columbia evokes our own
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_9:0.9500:As in each field of endeavor, each proud rival she
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_11:0.9750:In the tournament of nations, bearing off the highest
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_13:1.0000:And for all her sudden glory, I assert that unto
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_14:0.9500:you,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_16:0.9500:praise is due.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_17:0.9750:Take the purple wings of morning, girdle all the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_18:0.9750:globe in vain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_19:1.0000:Nowhere else shall you discover more of sinew, heart
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_21:1.0000:And from out these rural valleys, and from off these
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_22:0.9750:mountain slopes,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0474_23:0.9750:Have gone many brave evangelists of this young
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_3:0.9750:Who control your grand metropolis and capital, to-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_4:0.9500:day.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_5:1.0000:Now, the lesson I would leave you, friends and
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_7:1.0000:Cultivate not matter only, but the vineyard of the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_8:0.9500:heart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_9:0.9750:Give the plow its meed of honor, but no less the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_10:0.9750:brain and pen,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0475_11:1.0000:And, whatever else, keep raising your true women
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_4:1.0000:Ah, me ! what recollections swarm,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_5:1.0000:Louisa changed her maiden name,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_6:0.9750:To please her Francis Mandlebaum.*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_7:1.0000:And if for me, whose diary page
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_8:1.0000:In single blessedness descends,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_9:1.0000:The century quarter seems an age,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_10:0.9750:How must it look to these dear friends ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_11:0.9500:For they have had such cause for joy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_12:1.0000:Red-letter hours of festal mirth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_14:0.9500:For wedding day and children's birth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_15:0.9750:And they have had such scenes of woe,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_16:1.0000:As death of children must decree,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_18:1.0000:They married 'neath the almond-tree.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0476_19:0.9500:To them, indeed, the span of years
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0477_2:1.0000:Could they consent to quite forget.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0477_3:1.0000:Now when they round this arc of time,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0477_4:1.0000:I hope they will not spurn from me
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0477_5:1.0000:The gift I'd lay with friendship's thyme,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_4:0.9500:WHAT wonder Scotia's lyric bard
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_5:1.0000:All lyric bards surpasses,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_6:1.0000:Whose inspiration was the glance
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_7:1.0000:Of Scotia's bonnie lassies.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_8:1.0000:In Edinboro', on the Clyde,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_9:0.9750:In Ayr delicious creatures !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_10:1.0000:How I have worshipped, (as I sighed,)
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_11:1.0000:The glory of their features.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_12:1.0000:Perhaps it is ozonic air,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_13:1.0000:Off those gigantic mountains ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_14:1.0000:Perhaps the waters, as they flow
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_15:0.9750:From Afton's sparkling fountains :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_16:1.0000:Perhaps, more like, the genial light
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_17:1.0000:Of wholesome hearths, and cozy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_18:1.0000:That makes those eyes so clear and bright,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_19:1.0000:Those lips and cheeks so rosy.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_21:0.9500:That land can reproduce,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_22:1.0000:And many a maid walks there as proud
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0478_23:1.0000:As in the days of Bruce ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_3:1.0000:In fact, if not in fiction, leave
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_4:1.0000:A host of sweet survivors !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_5:1.0000:O, when shall I forget the morn,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_6:1.0000:On which the Judge and I,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_7:0.9500:At Melrose Abbey's guarded gates,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_8:1.0000:For guidance did apply.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_9:1.0000:Soft eyes from out the lattice peeped,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_10:1.0000:A welcome voice, but shy,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_11:1.0000:Said, " I'll encase my feet from dew,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_12:1.0000:The lawn is scarcely dry."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_13:1.0000:Then, in a trice, from out the door,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_14:1.0000:A vision, I'll declare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_15:0.9750:Burst, such as never seemed before
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_16:1.0000:Transcendently so fair.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_17:0.9750:That tabernacle of alLgrace
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_18:1.0000:I see in day-dreams now :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_19:1.0000:That figure, and that radiant face,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_20:1.0000:And that Madonna brow !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_21:0.9500:Sir Walter tells us, as we know,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_22:1.0000:To see Melrose aright,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_23:1.0000:We should behold its ruined walls
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0479_24:0.9500:Beneath the soft moonlight.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_3:1.0000:To gather its traditions up
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_4:1.0000:From lips of such a maiden !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_5:1.0000:I know not of her name or place,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_6:0.9750:Nor can conjecture even
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_7:1.0000:Whether on earth still beams her face,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_8:1.0000:Or one new star decks heaven.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_9:1.0000:But, living yet, a health this night !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_10:1.0000:There's not a flower that blows
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_11:1.0000:More fragrant on the banks of Tweed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_13:1.0000:O, Scotland ! ever bright 'ning page
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_14:1.0000:In my memorial volume ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_15:1.0000:For all thou hast, and art, we'd raise
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_16:0.9750:The laudatory column !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_17:1.0000:Thy scenery, thy history,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_18:1.0000:The scrolls thou hast unfurled,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_19:1.0000:The lanterns thou hast set ablaze
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_20:1.0000:To lumine all the world ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_21:1.0000:Let others speak to-night of these,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_22:1.0000:As fittingly they will.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_23:1.0000:Be mine my pretty text to keep
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0480_24:1.0000:My sweet task to fulfill ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_1:1.0000:To sing a simple heartfelt strain,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_2:1.0000:In honor of dear woman,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_3:1.0000:Who everywhere, but nowhere more,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_4:0.9500:Than upon Caledonia's shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_5:1.0000:Allies divine with human !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_6:0.9750:O, I am growing old apace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_7:1.0000:And yet I know not why
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_8:1.0000:Not unneglected of my glance,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_9:1.0000:The lassies pass me by.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_10:0.9750:I love them all ; fair flowers they are
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_11:1.0000:By our kind Author given,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_12:1.0000:Vouchsafing here some little share
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_13:1.0000:And foretaste of that Heaven.,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_14:1.0000:Where, let us hope, we all shall meet,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_15:1.0000:And on the blooming heather,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_16:1.0000:The other side of Jordan's stream,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_17:1.0000:Roam lovingly together.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_18:0.9750:So I conclude with sermon, what
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_19:1.0000:Was meant to be a song,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_20:1.0000:And, in a word God bless us all !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0481_21:0.9500:The sermon wasn't long.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_4:0.9750:THBEE centuries ago there trod
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_5:1.0000:The banks of Avon, up and down,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_6:1.0000:One, who upbore no earthly crown,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_7:1.0000:But crowned magnificent of God.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_8:1.0000:Imperial soul ! so vastly stored
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_9:1.0000:From out the treasuries of thought ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_10:1.0000:What empyrean realms it sought ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_11:0.9750:What undiscovered heights explored !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_13:1.0000:Seer, autocratic sage profound ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_14:1.0000:How shall thy crescent fame resound
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_15:1.0000:Through all the corridors of time !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_16:1.0000:Earth's sceptred kings may come at will,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_17:1.0000:And each abide his little day ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_18:1.0000:And strut his while, and pass away
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_19:1.0000:And other kings their places fill ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_20:1.0000:But THOUshalt still assert thy throne,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0482_21:1.0000:Whose grandeur shall attempt in vain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_2:0.9500:Majestical, supreme, alone !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_3:1.0000:For thou hast caught from out the spheres
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_4:1.0000:Of upper air, Promethean fire.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_5:0.9500:Proud Hermit, where none dare aspire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_6:1.0000:Thou scornest the retreat of years ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_7:1.0000:Years which shall pass us laughing by,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_8:1.0000:And leave us wrecked on Lethean shore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_9:0.9750:Whilst thou shalt live forever more
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0483_10:1.0000:In thoughts and words that cannot die !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_3:0.9750:As OLD in years, and rich in goods,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_4:1.0000:And flocks, and teeming soil,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_5:1.0000:A sire apportioned to liis sons
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_6:1.0000:The product of his toil.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_9:1.0000:It shall be his, who can to me
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_10:1.0000:The noblest act unfold."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_11:1.0000:Thereat the brothers separate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_12:1.0000:And go their several ways ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_13:1.0000:And to their aged sire return,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_14:0.9750:At lapse of many days.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_15:1.0000:Then spake the eldest brother : " Hear !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_16:1.0000:A stranger all his hoard
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_17:1.0000:Entrusted me ; the which I held,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_18:1.0000:And faithfully restored ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_19:0.9750:" Say, Father, may I not presume
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_20:1.0000:To claim the glittering prize ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0484_21:1.0000:How looks a noble deed like that,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_2:0.9500:" "What duty bade you do.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_3:1.0000:The deed was good, not noble though,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_4:0.9750:'T was simply, to be true."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_5:0.9750:The other spake : " As journeyed I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_6:1.0000:Along in careless way,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_7:1.0000:I heard a fearful wild outcry
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_8:1.0000:From out a storm-tossed bay.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_9:0.9500:" I plunged into the angry wave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_10:1.0000:The drowning child upbore ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_11:1.0000:And saved it. from the watery grave,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_12:1.0000:Could noble man do more ?"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_14:1.0000:What mortals here below
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_15:1.0000:In kindly offices of love
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_16:0.9750:Unto each other owe."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_18:1.0000:Of a stupendous steep-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_19:0.9750:Unconscious of his peril lay
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_20:1.0000:My enemy, asleep.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_21:1.0000:" Within my hand I held his life,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0485_22:0.9500:One thrust had hurled him o'er,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0486_2:0.9500:And we are foes no more."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_4:1.0000:I was distinctly floored.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_5:1.0000:I noticed, while I had my bed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_6:1.0000:Therewith I had my board.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_7:1.0000:But now it 's morn, and breakfast time ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_8:1.0000:I'll sally forth and beg.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_9:1.0000:I'd like a cup of old Bohea,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_10:0.9750:A biscuit and an egg.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_11:1.0000:Well, here's a place seems promising ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_12:1.0000:I'll ring the kitchen bell.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_13:0.9750:There's something luscious broiling there,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_14:0.9750:O, what delicious smell !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_15:0.9750:All ! here comes Bridget ; Pray, my dear,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_16:1.0000:Your cooking I admire,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_17:1.0000:Would you a gracious morsel give
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_18:1.0000:To quell my stomach's ire ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_19:1.0000:What's this she says ? " Begone, you wretch!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_20:1.0000:Your blarney is all stuff ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_21:1.0000:And your profession 's overdone,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_22:1.0000:We've seen and heard enough !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_23:1.0000:Begone, I say ! and mind you this,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0487_24:1.0000:Don't show your face here more."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_1:0.9750:With that, she tosses up her nose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_2:1.0000:And, spiteful, slams the door.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_3:1.0000:Well, well, I'll go across the street,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_4:1.0000:And see what better luck ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_5:1.0000:A saucier girl, in all my rounds,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_6:1.0000:I'm sure I never struck.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_7:0.9750:O, ho ! what's here ! a boarding house
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_8:1.0000:I'll make another dash ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_9:1.0000:I see the breakfast bill of fare,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_10:0.9750:Fish-balls and mutton-hash.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_11:0.9750:Now, if that matron had but thought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_12:1.0000:To serve those viands warmer,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_13:1.0000:And not from off that baby's plate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_14:0.9750:I wouldn't wish to storm her.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_15:1.0000:Here, pup ; here kit ! come, try your teeth
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_16:0.9750:And talented digestion ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_17:1.0000:I pass pass out, on this queer game,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_18:1.0000:Take, eat ; don't ask a question !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_19:1.0000:But now, 'tis getting serious,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_20:1.0000:And whither shall I wend ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0488_21:1.0000:A lively notion strikes my mind,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_1:1.0000:Here's just the place ; I see a face
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_2:1.0000:Benevolent, all over ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_3:1.0000:O, lady ! for the love of God,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_4:1.0000:Some work for me discover !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_5:1.0000:I'm travelling by night and day
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_6:1.0000:The wide, wide country through,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_7:1.0000:To find some steady place to stay,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_8:1.0000:Some useful thing to do.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_9:0.9750:And even now I'm famishing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_10:0.9500:And oh ! were I but fed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_11:1.0000:How gladly would I scrub that walk,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_12:1.0000:And rake that flower-bed !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_13:1.0000:I had her there ; that tea was fine,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_14:1.0000:How nice the ham and eggs !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_15:1.0000:The pancakes came right in my line ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_16:0.9500:Once more I'm on my pegs !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_17:1.0000:This spoon I'll pawn somewhere away
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0489_18:0.9750:"When many days have sped ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_5:0.9750:Once more be wooed from out thy coy retreat ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_7:0.9750:This brilliant throng, this honored pair, to greet.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_8:0.9500:Semi-Centennial ! what a lapse of years,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_9:0.9750:Since these good friends in wedlock clasped the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_12:0.9500:Adventured the long stroll upon Time's strand.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_13:1.0000:I learn to honor, as I older grow,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_14:1.0000:As I would fain be honored, were it mine
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_15:0.9500:So long to live ; the " gude folk" whom I know,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_16:1.0000:Whose history reaches to the far " lang syne."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_17:1.0000:Half century ago ; Exceeding queer !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_19:0.9750:How many forms, like mine, which were not here,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0490_21:0.9500:For we were dead ; out in the void somewhere ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_1:0.9500:The world moved on without us ; while this pair
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_2:0.9750:Were living, breathing, loving souls as we.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_3:0.9750:The same hills here reflected the same sun ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_4:1.0000:The same fields spread their carpeture of green ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_5:0.9500:The same bright river sought its course to run ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_7:0.9750:rene ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_8:0.9500:And most of us were, where, O strange! we dread
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_9:1.0000:Once more in course of nature to withdraw ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_10:1.0000:In realms, where kindred souls each other wed,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_11:0.9750:And Love, we trust, is universal law.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_12:0.9750:O, what poetic sermon would we sing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_13:0.9750:So the kind muse, would breathe into the strain ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_14:1.0000:But ah ! she flitteth with uncertain wing ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_20:0.9500:And when we greet the man and wife, who all that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0491_22:0.9500:Have clung together ; prose is dull, and thought
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_4:1.0000:What memories it congregates in overwhelming
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_6:0.9500:To challenge all the force of speech, and melody of
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_8:0.9750:I see in distant retrospect, the sturdy, striving
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_10:0.9500:Ambitious, all his energy in life-work to employ ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_12:0.9750:demand
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_13:0.9750:Some recognition of his worth, at this world's jeal-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0492_17:0.9500:Here, spent his childhood and his youth ; and here
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_3:0.9750:But in the long run give to me the faithful one
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_9:0.9750:Grown rich, perhaps ; within a home where luxuries
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_11:0.9750:He'll leave at last his neighborhood much richer
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_15:0.9500:Fain would we summon the fond muse, in lightly
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_17:0.9750:Hither approach ; and for the nonce, with smiling
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_19:1.0000:And deck this septuagenary brow with fitting
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_20:0.9750:crown.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_21:0.9500:But hush ! we can but apprehend, there'll be domes-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0493_23:0.9750:Unless, right here, the muse pays some attention
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_3:1.0000:Which brought the boy upon his knee, and bade his
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_5:0.9500:We'll not narrate the courtship scenes enacted by
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_9:0.9500:Had we been here, officious aid had hardly been al-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_10:0.9500:lowed.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_16:0.9750:did flow ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_18:0.9500:nor faltar,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_19:0.9500:But persevered until he led his lady to the al-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_21:0.9500:Though his has been a good success, the world's af-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_22:0.9500:fairs amid,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0494_23:0.9500:His marriage was the smartest thing, we think he
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_3:1.0000:So he could say through all these years ; " there
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_5:0.9500:She helped him toil and calculate ; fond babes to
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_9:0.9500:the ladle,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_10:0.9750:To make " creation's lord" sit down, and rock that
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_18:0.9500:laugh ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_19:1.0000:You notice, what I'm dealing out, is something
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_20:1.0000:"half and half ;"
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_21:0.9500:But these old people, you can see at superficial
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0495_23:0.9500:Are growing dreadful frisky, and impatient for the
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0496_1:0.9500:So, let the hearty bugler blow his most arousing
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0496_5:0.9750:But, when we go ; both glad and sad, how must
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_3:1.0000:Fond friends and kindred round the couch were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_4:0.9750:sighing,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_5:1.0000:AVhile there in state, quiescent, I was lying,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_6:0.9750:Awaiting calmly the expiring breath.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_7:1.0000:It seemed, as on a throne I was uplifted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_8:1.0000:So all surrounding faces gazed on me ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_9:1.0000:O, had I been with tongue of angel gifted,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_10:1.0000:How had I half disclosed what I could see !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_11:0.9750:j with rapt and beatific vision,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_13:0.9750:Where, midst the empyrean spheres elysian,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_14:1.0000:The seraphs love to live, and live to love.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_15:0.9750:Then, all at once, at beck of some supernal
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_16:0.9750:And glorious being radiance o'er her head
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0497_18:0.9750:And earth's poor grovellers pronounced me " dead.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_2:0.9750:SHE comes ! I know her footsteps as they fall
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_3:0.9750:On this glad earth, so gloriously drest,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_4:1.0000:Once more in all her bowers to install
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_5:1.0000:This new-born goddess, this delightful guest.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_6:1.0000:She comes ! I scent, in violet and rose,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_7:0.9750:Her perfumed garments as she trips along ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_8:0.9500:How every apple-blossomed ringlet flows,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_9:1.0000:As she moves on a personated song !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_10:1.0000:She comes ! the forest trees are all awake ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_11:0.9750:The cataract exults ; the warm sun shines ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_17:1.0000:We love her after all, the first and last ! '*
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_18:0.9500:She comes ! best season of the rolling years,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0498_19:0.9750:Most welcome ; would we doubt the reason why ?
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_2:0.9500:Nor wrapped in memory's spell,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_3:1.0000:But in some other self enshrined ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_4:1.0000:Absorbed, yet free to dwell
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_5:1.0000:"Within the frescoed chambers of the mind.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_6:1.0000:Unnumbered scenes are set,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_7:1.0000:Distinct, but incomplete they seem ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_8:1.0000:As when a heart regret
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_9:1.0000:Swells to the anguished outcry of a dream.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_10:1.0000:Mid twilight views of years,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_11:1.0000:Serene exulting yet oppressed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_12:1.0000:Wherein the boy appears
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_13:1.0000:I've rocked a thousand times upon my breast.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_14:1.0000:'Tis but a flashing look,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_15:1.0000:I wish and wish not to prolong !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_16:1.0000:'Tis caught, then quick forsook :
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_17:0.9500:The wild, woird witchery of his infant song!
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0499_18:0.9750:And then consummate skill
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_2:0.9500:The sorcery Genius summons, weaves and flings.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_4:0.9750:Of peaceful sail ; of wrecking shocks I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_5:1.0000:The captain steeped in rum,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_6:1.0000:Tossing his vessel on the jagged rocks !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_8:1.0000:Of waves and winds ; 'mid women's cries ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_10:1.0000:Bathed in symphonious echoes from the skies I
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_11:0.9750:Child of last hope and fears !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_12:1.0000:Youth, with seraphic rhythm endowed !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_13:1.0000:Comrade of choicest years,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0500_14:1.0000:A brother's soul above thy grave is bowed !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_4:1.0000:I remember the sendee how fitly begun,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_5:0.9500:As he read the old parable " Prodigal Son."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_6:0.9750:As that voice, so magnificent, rendered the text,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_7:0.9500:A stranger enraptured, whose seat was just next,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_9:0.9750:I speak reverential ; could tell a sweet story ! "
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_10:1.0000:The prodigal son ! I would touchingly bid
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_11:0.9750:Every prodigal son to do just as he did.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_12:1.0000:You're a prodigal now ; you need only return,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_13:0.9750:To discover what hearts for your welcoming yearn.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_14:1.0000:No matter what goods and what hours you have
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_16:0.9500:No matter how far from life's duty you've wan-
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_17:0.9500:dered.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0501_23:0.9500:And faithfully wrought with laborious arm ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_2:1.0000:In the old man's heart's chambers, a place was still
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_3:0.9750:there !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_4:1.0000:And the boy ; we'll acknowledge his courses were
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_5:0.9500:wild,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_8:0.9500:From the dreadful deceits of the world would fain
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0502_9:0.9500:come
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_3:1.0000:Partaker of my hopes and fears ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_4:1.0000:Rejoicing when I did rejoice,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_5:1.0000:And, when I wept, with gentle voice,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_6:1.0000:And sympathetic words, assuaging
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_7:1.0000:The agony within me raging ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_8:1.0000:Fond mother of fond babes of mine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_9:1.0000:Priestess, at our domestic shrine ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_10:1.0000:Sunlight of our domestic hearth ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_11:1.0000:This benizon, of little worth,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_12:1.0000:Take from thine ardent swain of yore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_15:0.9750:Strange ! how as people come and go,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_16:1.0000:I chanced that sparkling lass to know.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_17:1.0000:From out her eye there flashed one dart,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_18:1.0000:Which quite transfixed, and won my heart.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_19:1.0000:I yielded all I was, and had ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_20:1.0000:Too fortunate, too proud, too glad
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_21:1.0000:To clasp as mine that faithful hand,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_22:1.0000:And kneel beneath the silken band,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_23:1.0000:Which bound us happily in one,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0503_24:1.0000:As was our wedded life begun ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_1:0.9750:What treasure in my chosen mate,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_2:1.0000:No chosen words can fitly state.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_3:1.0000:All our experiences through,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_4:0.9750:Thou hast been constant, loving, true.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_5:1.0000:In all vicissitudes of life
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_6:0.9750:Thou stand' st approved,- a model wife !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_8:1.0000:These words, and give them reverent heed ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_10:0.9500:The years roll on ; 'tis growing late,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_11:1.0000:And we anon must separate;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_12:1.0000:But somewhere, on some shining shore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_13:1.0000:Where amaranth blooms evermore,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_14:1.0000:Let's hope, the good God will permit,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_15:1.0000:That, re-united, we may sit,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_16:1.0000:And hear sweet strains of music sounding,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_17:0.9750:Where Heaven's grand minstrelsy resounding
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_18:1.0000:Shall welcome to the scenes above
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_21:0.9750:Meanwhile, be thou, as thou hast been,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_22:1.0000:Within this home enthroned as queen.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_23:1.0000:Still give, from thy resources ample,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0504_24:1.0000:Our children, precept and example ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0505_1:0.9750:Be my first critic as thou hast,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0505_2:1.0000:Mentor unknown through all the past ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0505_3:1.0000:And where or how our lines may be,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0505_4:0.9750:Beam on my pathway ; cleave to me ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_3:0.9500:Until upon that honored grave we place,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_4:1.0000:With filial and with reverential grace,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_5:0.9750:A simple garland of memorial flowers.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_6:1.0000:A man not only good and true, but great,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_7:1.0000:To us, indeed, almost a demi-god ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_8:0.9750:His smile was bliss ; his frown was gloom ; his nod
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_9:1.0000:Oracular ; his lightest speech was weight.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_10:0.9750:Whoe'er would meet his logic, must prepare ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_14:0.9500:Imperious oft, and with his thoughts astray,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_15:0.9750:How would he sometimes overawe us boys.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_16:0.9750:How well admonished then to hush our noise,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_18:1.0000:Yet we remember, in his leisure hour,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_19:1.0000:The golden moments of his care's surcease,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_20:1.0000:How would he, giving else a brief release,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0506_21:1.0000:Abundant floods of warm affection shower.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_1:0.9500:What fund of wisdom, wit. and anecdote
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_2:1.0000:From that prolific intellect outpoured !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_3:1.0000:How apt, how lavish, from his memory stored,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_4:0.9750:Could he the royal bards and sages quote !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_5:0.9750:How Judges hearkened ; and the learned Shaw
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_6:0.9750:Exclaimed, as he, our father, argued oft
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_7:0.9750:With rivals of that day, on themes aloft,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_8:0.9750:" He came to Berkshire county to learn law."
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_9:0.9750:But oh ! before the " august twelve," how vast ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_10:1.0000:How irresistible, o'erwhelming powers
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_11:0.9750:Our sire displayed ; as through unheeded hours,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_12:0.9750:Spellbound he held his willing captives fast !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_13:1.0000:We know some littler men had larger sphere,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_14:0.9500:And we have lived the why to understand ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_15:1.0000:But when and where he spake, was to command ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_16:0.9750:He feared no anakim, he was their peer !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_17:1.0000:How oft, in afternoon of Sabbath day,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_18:0.9750:Would he the psalmist and the seer intone ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_19:0.9750:Voicing the sacred text, as he alone
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_20:1.0000:Could render words earth's saints were born to say.
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_21:1.0000:(And there our mother and our sister sat,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_22:1.0000:What specimens of glorious womanhood !
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0507_23:0.9500:Both gone ; O God ! I would not, if I could,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0508_3:0.9500:Whate'er we lose in future, or secure ;
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0508_4:0.9500:One fixed, irrevocable boon is sure,
sumnerpoems00sumnrich_0508_5:0.9500:The certain sonship of a noble sire.

languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_13:0.9500:(a) In the beginner 1 s first grade
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_23:0.9750:I had two pillows at my head,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0046_24:0.9750:And all my toys beside me lay
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_1:1.0000:And sometimes for an hour or so
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_2:1.0000:I watched my leaden soldiers go,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_3:1.0000:With different uniforms and drills,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_4:1.0000:Among the bed-clothes, through the hills.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_5:1.0000:And sometimes sent my ships in fleets,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_6:1.0000:All up and down among the sheets,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_7:1.0000:Or brought my trees and houses out,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_8:1.0000:And planted cities all about.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_9:1.0000:I was the giant great and still
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_10:0.9750:That sits upon the pillow-hill,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0047_11:1.0000:And sees before him, dale and plain,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0049_19:0.9750:b. In the primary grades
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_2:1.0000:Between the dark and the daylight,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_3:1.0000:When the night is beginning to lower,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_4:1.0000:Comes a pause in the day's occupations,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_6:1.0000:I hear in the chamber above me,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_7:1.0000:The patter of little feet,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_8:1.0000:The sound of a door that is opened,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_9:1.0000:And voices soft and sweet.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_10:1.0000:From my study I see in the lamplight,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_11:1.0000:Descending the broad hall stair,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_13:1.0000:And Edith with golden hair.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_14:1.0000:A whisper and then a silence ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_15:1.0000:Yet I know by their merry eyes
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_16:1.0000:They are plotting and planning together
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_17:1.0000:To take me by surprise.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_18:1.0000:A sudden rush from the stairway,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_19:1.0000:A sudden raid from the hall !
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_20:0.9750:By three doors left unguarded
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_21:1.0000:They enter my castle wall !
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_22:1.0000:They climb up into my turret
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_23:1.0000:O'er the arms and back of my chair;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_24:1.0000:If I try to escape, they surround me ;
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_25:0.9750:They seem to be everywhere.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_26:1.0000:They almost devour me with kisses,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_27:1.0000:Their arms about me entwine,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0051_29:1.0000:In his Mouse-tower on the Rhine !
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_1:1.0000:Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_2:1.0000:Because you have scaled the wall,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_3:1.0000:Such an old mustache as I am
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_4:1.0000:Is not a match for you all !
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_5:1.0000:I have you fast in my fortress,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_6:1.0000:And will not let you depart,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_7:1.0000:But put you down in the dungeon,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_8:1.0000:In the round-tower of my heart.
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_9:1.0000:And there will I keep you forever,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_10:1.0000:Yes, forever and a day,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0052_11:1.0000:Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0054_16:0.9750:The children will be interested in hearing
languageteaching00cooluoft_0055_15:0.9500:Out of the hills of Habersham,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0055_16:1.0000:Down the valleys of Hall,
languageteaching00cooluoft_0055_17:1.0000:I hurry amain to reach the plain,

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0073_9:0.9500:Grown so corrupted in their Taste,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_25:0.9750:--That lady is the dullest Soul--
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0075_27:0.9750:As v;ho should say--she wants it here.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0076_23:0.9750:She fancies Musick in his Tongue,

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_3:0.9500:Attends us first, and leaves us last:
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0077_4:0.9750:K'hy she likes him, admire not at her.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0078_6:0.9750:When Love's Allurements long are past,

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0084_21:0.9500:While others do as much for him.

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_23:0.9750:For framing Laws to govern States;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0096_25:0.9750:So large to graspe the Circle round;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_9:0.9500:Of diff'rent Spirits to discern.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0100_10:0.9500:And how distinguish, which is which.

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_15:0.9750:What subject you can manage best;
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_16:1.0000:Whether your Genius most inclines

echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_31:0.9750:And often try what weight they can support,
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_32:0.9500:And what their shoulders are too weak to bear.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0102_33:0.9500:[For] After a serious and judicious choice.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0105_18:0.9500:But meddle seldom with their Match.
echoicpoetryofjo00fiscrich_0109_3:0.9500:We now can better do without him,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_3:1.0000:Her hair was thick with many a curl
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_6:0.9500:And she was wildly clad :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_7:1.0000:Her eyes were fair, and very fair
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_8:1.0000:Her beauty made me glad.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_12:1.0000:And wondering looked at me.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_13:1.0000:" And where are they ? I pray you tell."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_14:0.9750:She answered, " Seven are we ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_17:1.0000:' Two of us in the churchyard lie,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_18:1.0000:My sister and my brother ;

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_22:1.0000:And two are gone to sea,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_23:1.0000:Yet ye are seven ! I pray you tell,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_24:0.9750:Sweet Maid, how this may be."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_25:0.9750:Then did the little Maid reply,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_26:0.9500:" Seven boys and girls are we ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0038_27:0.9500:Two of us in the churchyard lie,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0039_15:1.0000:I take my little porringer,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0039_26:0.9500:And I could run and slide,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_7:1.0000:'Twas throwing words away : for still
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_8:0.9750:The little Maid would have her will,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_14:0.9500:I chanced to see at break of day 5
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_16:1.0000:No mate, no comrade Lucy knew ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_17:1.0000:She dwelt on a wide moor,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_18:0.9500:The sweetest thing that ever grew
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_20:0.9750:You yet may spy the fawn at play,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_21:1.0000:The hare upon the green ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_22:1.0000:But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_23:0.9500:Will never more be seen.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_25:1.0000:You to the town must go ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_26:1.0000:And take a lantern, Child, to light
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0040_27:1.0000:Your mother through the snow."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_2:1.0000:'Tis scarcely afternoon -
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_4:1.0000:And yonder is the Moon."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_5:1.0000:At this bhe Father raised his hook,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_6:0.9750:And snapped a faggot-band ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_9:1.0000:Not blither is the mountain roe :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_10:1.0000:With many a wanton stroke
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_11:1.0000:Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_13:1.0000:The snow came on before its time :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_14:1.0000:She wandered up and down ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_15:1.0000:And many a hill did Lucy climb ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_16:0.9500:But never reached the town.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_17:0.9750:The wretched parents all that night OK
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_18:1.0000:Went shouting far and wide ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_19:1.0000:But there was neither sound nor sight
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_20:1.0000:To serve them for a guide.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_21:0.9750:At day-break on a hill they stood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_23:0.9500:And thence they saw the bridge of wood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_24:0.9500:A furlong from their door.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_25:0.9750:They wept and, turning homeward, cried,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0041_26:0.9750:In Heaven we all shall meet : "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_2:1.0000:They tracked the footmarks small ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_5:0.9750:And then an open field they crossed :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_6:1.0000:The marks were still the same ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_7:1.0000:They tracked them on, nor ever lost ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_8:0.9500:And to the Bridge they came.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_11:1.0000:Into the middle of the plank ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_12:0.9500:And farther there were none 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_16:1.0000:Upon the lonesome wild.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_17:1.0000:O'er rough and smooth she trips along
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_18:0.9750:And never looks behind ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0042_19:0.9500:And sings a solitary song gg
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_2:1.0000:IP from the public way you turn your steps
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_6:1.0000:The pastoral mountains front you, face to face.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_7:1.0000:But, courage ! for around that boisterous Brook
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_8:1.0000:The mountains have all opened out themselves,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_9:1.0000:And made a hidden valley of their own. ]
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_10:0.9750:No habitation can be seen ; but they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_11:1.0000:Who journey hither find themselves alone
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_12:1.0000:With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_13:1.0000:That overhead are sailing in the sky.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_14:0.9750:It is in truth an utter solitude j 15
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_15:0.9750:Nor should I have made mention of this Dell
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_16:0.9750:But for one object which you might pass by,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_17:1.0000:Might see and notice not. Beside the brook
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_18:1.0000:Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_19:0.9750:And to that place a story appertains, 20
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_21:0.9750:Is not unfit, I deem, for the fireside,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_22:1.0000:Or for the summer shade. It was the first
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_23:1.0000:Of those domestic tales that spake to me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_24:0.9750:Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men 25
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_25:0.9500:Whom I already loved ; not verily
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_26:1.0000:For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_27:1.0000:Where was their occupation and abode.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0045_28:0.9750:And hence this tale, while I was yet a Boy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_1:0.9500:Of Nature, by the gentle agency
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_2:1.0000:Of natural objects led me on to feel
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_3:1.0000:For passions that were not my own, and think
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_7:0.9750:Homely and rude, I will relate the same
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_8:1.0000:For the delight of a few natural hearts ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_9:1.0000:And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_14:0.9500:An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_17:1.0000:Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_18:1.0000:And in his Shepherd's calling he was prompt
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_19:1.0000:And watchful more than ordinary men.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_20:0.9500:Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds, 50
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_21:0.9500:Of blasts of every tone ; and, oftentimes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_22:1.0000:When others heeded not, he heard the South
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_23:1.0000:Make subterraneous music, like the noise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_27:0.9750:" The winds are now devising work for me ! "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_28:1.0000:And, truly, at all times, the storm that drives
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_29:0.9750:The traveller to a shelter summoned him
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_32:1.0000:That came to him and left him on the heights.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0046_33:1.0000:So lived he till his eightieth year was past.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_4:1.0000:Melds, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_5:1.0000:The common air ; the hills, which he so oft
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_6:0.9500:Had climbed with vigorous steps ; which had impressed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_7:0.9750:So many incidents upon his mind ^0
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_9:1.0000:Which, like a book, preserved the memory
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_10:1.0000:Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_11:0.9750:Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_13:0.9500:Those fields, those hills what could they less? had laid
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_14:1.0000:Strong hold on his affections, were to him
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_15:1.0000:A pleasurable feeling of blind love,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_19:1.0000:Though younger than himself full twenty years.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_20:1.0000:She was a woman of a stirring life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_22:0.9750:Of antique form, this large for spinning wool, 85
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_23:0.9500:That small for flax; and if one wheel had rest>
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_24:1.0000:It was because the other was at work.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_25:1.0000:The pair had but one inmate in their house,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_26:1.0000:An only Child, who had been born to them
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_27:0.9750:When Michael, telling o'er his years, began 90
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_29:1.0000:With one foot in the grave. This only Son
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0047_30:1.0000:With two brave Sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_1:1.0000:For endless industry. When day was gone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_2:1.0000:And from their occupations out of doors
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_3:1.0000:The Son and Father were come home, even then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_4:1.0000:Their labour did not cease ; unless when all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_5:1.0000:Turned to their cleanly supper-board, and there,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_6:1.0000:Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_7:1.0000:Sat round their basket piled with oaten cakes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_8:0.9500:And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when their meal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_10:1.0000:And his old father both betook themselves
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_11:1.0000:To such convenient work as might employ
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_12:1.0000:Their hands by the fireside ; perhaps to card
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_15:0.9750:Or other implement of house or field.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_16:1.0000:Down from the ceiling by the chimney *s edge,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_17:1.0000:That in our ancient uncouth country style
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_18:0.9500:Did with a huge projection overbrow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_21:0.9750:An aged utensil, which had performed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_22:1.0000:Service beyond all others of its kind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_23:1.0000:Early at evening % did it burn and late,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_25:0.9500:Which, going by from year to year, had found,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_26:1.0000:And left the couple neither gay perhaps
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_27:0.9750:Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_30:0.9500:There by the light of this old lamp they sat,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_31:0.9750:Father and Son, while late into the night
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_32:1.0000:The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0048_33:0.9750:Making the cottage through the silent hours
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_2:0.9500:This Light was famous in its neighbourhood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_3:1.0000:And was a public symbol of the life
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_4:1.0000:That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_5:1.0000:Their Cottage on a plot of rising ground
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_8:0.9750:And westward to the village near the Lake;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_9:0.9750:And from this constant light, so regular
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_10:0.9500:And so far seen, the House itself, by all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_11:0.9750:Who dwelt within the limits of the vale, 140
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_13:1.0000:Thus living on through such a length of years.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_14:1.0000:The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_16:0.9500:This Son of his old age was yet more dear 145
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_17:1.0000:Less from instinctive tenderness, the same
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_18:1.0000:Blind spirit, which is in the blood of all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_19:1.0000:Than that a child more than all other gifts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_20:0.9750:Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_21:0.9500:And stirrings of inquietude, when they 150
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_22:0.9750:By tendency of nature needs must fail.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_23:1.0000:Exceeding was the love he bare to him,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_24:1.0000:His Heart, and his Heart's joy ! For oftentimes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_26:0.9750:Had done him female service, not alone 155
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_27:0.9750:For pastime and delight, as is the use
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_28:1.0000:Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_29:1.0000:To acts of tenderness ; and he had rocked
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0049_30:1.0000:His cradle with a woman's gentle hand.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_1:1.0000:To have the Young-one in his sight, when he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_2:1.0000:Had work by his own door, or when he sat
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_3:0.9500:With sheep before him on his Shepherd's stool, 165
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_5:1.0000:Stood,- and, from its enormous breadth of shade
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_6:1.0000:Chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_7:0.9500:Thence in our rustic dialect was called
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_10:0.9750:With others round them, earnest all and blithe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_11:0.9750:Would Michael exercise his heart with looks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_12:0.9750:Of fond correction and reproof bestowed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_14:0.9750:By catching at their legs, or with his shouts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_15:0.9750:Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_20:1.0000:With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_21:1.0000:With iron, making it throughout in all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_22:0.9500:Due requisites a perfect shepherd's Staff,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_25:1.0000:At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_26:1.0000:And, to his office prematurely called,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_29:0.9500:And for this cause not always, I believe.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_30:1.0000:Receiving from his Father hire of praise ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0050_31:1.0000:Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_2:0.9500:Against the mountain blasts ; and to the heights,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_3:1.0000:Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_4:1.0000:He with his Father daily went, and they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_5:1.0000:Were as companions, why should I relate
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_7:0.9750:Were dearer now ? that from the Boy there came
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_8:1.0000:Feelings and emanations things which were
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_9:1.0000:Light to the sun and music to the wind j
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_10:0.9500:And that the Old Man's heart seemed born again!
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_12:1.0000:And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_13:1.0000:He was his comfort and his daily hope.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_14:1.0000:WHILE in this sort the simple Household lived
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_15:1.0000:From day to day, to Michael's ear there came
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_17:1.0000:Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_18:1.0000:In surety for his Brother's Son, a man
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_19:1.0000:Of an industrious life, and ample means,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_20:0.9750:But unforseen misfortunes suddenly
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_23:1.0000:A grievous penalty, but little less
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_24:1.0000:Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_25:1.0000:At the first hearing, for a moment took
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_26:1.0000:More hope out of his life than he supposed 220
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_27:0.9500:That any old man ever could have lost.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_28:1.0000:As soon as he had gathered so much strength
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_29:1.0000:That he could look his trouble in the face,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_30:1.0000:It seemed that his sole refuge was to sell
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0051_31:0.9500:A portion of his patrimonial fields. 225
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_1:1.0000:And his heart failed him. " Isabel," said he,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_2:1.0000:Two evenings after he had heard the news,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_5:0.9750:Have we all lived ; yet if these fields of ours
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_6:1.0000:Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_7:1.0000:That I could not lie quiet in my grave.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_8:0.9750:Our lot is a hard lot ; the sun himself
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_10:1.0000:And I have lived to be a fool at last
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_11:1.0000:To my own family. An evil Man
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_12:1.0000:That was, and made an evil choice, if he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_13:1.0000:Were false to us ; and if he were not false,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_16:1.0000:'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_17:1.0000:When I began, my purpose was to speak
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_18:0.9750:Of remedies, and of a cheerful hope.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_21:1.0000:He shall possess it, free as is the wind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_22:1.0000:That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_23:1.0000:Another Kinsman he will be our friend
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_25:0.9500:Thriving in trade and Luke to him shall go,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_26:1.0000:And with his Kinsman's help and his own thrift
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_27:1.0000:He quickly will repair this loss, and then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_28:1.0000:May come again to us. If here he stay,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_31:0.9500:And Isabel sat silent, for her mind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0052_32:0.9500:Was busy, looking back into past times.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_1:0.9500:They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_2:1.0000:And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_3:1.0000:A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_4:1.0000:And, with this basket on his arm, the Lad
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_7:0.9750:To go and overlook his merchandise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_8:1.0000:Bevond the seas : where he grew wondrous rich,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_9:0.9750:And left estates and monies to the poor,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_10:0.9500:And, at his birth-place, built a Chapel floored 270
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_11:1.0000:With marble, which he sent from foreign lands.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_12:1.0000:These thoughts, and many others of like sort,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_13:1.0000:Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_15:0.9500:And thus resumed : " Well, Isabel ! this scheme, 275
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_16:1.0000:These two days, has been meat and drink to nie.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_17:1.0000:Far more than we have lost is left us yet.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_18:1.0000:We have enough I wish indeed that I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_19:1.0000:Were younger, but this hope is a good hope.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_21:0.9750:Buy for him more, and let us send him forth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_22:1.0000:To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_23:1.0000:If he could go, the Boy should go to-night."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_24:0.9750:Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_26:0.9750:Was restless morn and night, and all day long
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_27:1.0000:Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_28:1.0000:Things needful for the journey of her son.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_32:1.0000:Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_33:0.9750:And when they rose at morning she could see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0053_34:0.9750:That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_3:1.0000:We have no other Child but thee to lose,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_4:1.0000:None to remember do not go away,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_5:1.0000:For if thou leave thy Father he will die."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_6:0.9500:The youth made answer with a jocund voice ; 300
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_7:0.9500:And Isabel, when she had told her fears,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_8:1.0000:Recovered heart. That evening her best fare
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_9:1.0000:Did she bring forth, and all together sat
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_10:0.9500:Like happy people round a Christmas fire.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_12:0.9750:And all the ensuing week the house appeared
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_13:1.0000:As cheerful as a grove in Spring : at length
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_14:1.0000:The expected letter from their Kinsman came,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_15:0.9750:With kind assurances that he would do
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_17:0.9750:To which, requests were added, that forthwith
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_18:1.0000:He might be sent to him. Ten times or more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_19:1.0000:The letter was read over ; Isabel
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_20:0.9500:Went forth to show it to the neighbours round ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_22:0.9750:A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_24:1.0000:"He shall depart to-morrow." To this word
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_27:0.9500:Would surely be forgotten. But at length
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_28:1.0000:She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_31:0.9500:To build a Sheep-fold ; and, before he heard 325
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0054_32:0.9500:The tidings of his melancholy loss,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_1:1.0000:For this same purpose he had gathered up
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_2:1.0000:A heap of stones, which by the Streamlet's edge
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_3:1.0000:Lay thrown together, ready for the work.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_5:1.0000:And soon as they had reached the place he stopped
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_6:0.9500:And thus the Old Man spake to him : " My Son,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_7:1.0000:To-morrow thou wilt leave me : with full heart
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_8:1.0000:I look upon thee, for thou art the same
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_9:0.9750:That wert a promise to me ere thy birth, 33")
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_10:1.0000:And all thy life hast been my daily joy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_11:1.0000:I will relate to thee some little part
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_12:1.0000:Of our two histories ; 'twill do thee good
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_13:0.9500:When thou art from me, even if 1 should speak
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_14:0.9750:Of things thou canst not know of. After thou 340
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_15:1.0000:First earnest into the world as oft befalls
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_16:1.0000:To new-born infants thou didst sleep away
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_17:1.0000:Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_18:1.0000:Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_19:1.0000:And still I loved thee with increasing love. 345
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_20:1.0000:Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_21:1.0000:Than when I heard thee by our own fireside
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_22:0.9750:First uttering, without words, a natural tune;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_25:0.9500:And in the open fields my life was passed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_26:1.0000:And on the mountains ; else I think that thou
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_27:1.0000:Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_28:1.0000:But we were playmates, Lnke : among these hills,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_30:0.9750:Have played together, nor with me didst thou
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_31:0.9500:Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0055_32:0.9750:Luke had a manly heart ; but at these words
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_1:0.9750:That these are things of which I need not speak.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_2:1.0000:Even to the utmost I have been to thee
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_3:1.0000:A kind and a good Father : and herein
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_4:0.9500:I but repay a gift which I myself
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_6:0.9750:Beyond the common life of man, I still
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_7:1.0000:Remember them who loved me in my youth.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_8:1.0000:Both of them sleep together : here they lived,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_9:0.9750:As all their Forefathers had done ; and when
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_11:0.9500:To give their bodies to the family mould.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_12:1.0000:I wished that thou shouldst live the life they lived
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_13:1.0000:But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_14:1.0000:And see so little gain from threescore years.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_16:0.9750:Till I was forty years of age, not more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_17:1.0000:Than half of my inheritance was mine.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_21:0.9500:Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_22:1.0000:If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_23:0.9500:That thou shouldst go." At this the Old Man paused;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_28:0.9500:Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_32:1.0000:I will do mine. I will begin again
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0056_33:0.9750:With many tasks that were resigned to thee :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_2:1.0000:All works which I was wont to do alone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_3:0.9750:Before I knew thy face. Heaven bless thee, Boy !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_4:1.0000:Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_5:1.0000:With many hopes. It should be so Yes yes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_6:0.9500:I knew that thou couldst never have a wish 400
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_8:1.0000:Only by links of love : when thou art gone
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_9:1.0000:What will be left to us ! But, I forget
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_12:1.0000:When thou art gone away, should evil men
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_13:1.0000:Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_14:1.0000:And of this moment ; hither turn thy thoughts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_15:1.0000:And God will strengthen thee : amid all fear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_18:1.0000:Who, being innocent, did for that cause
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_19:0.9750:Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_20:1.0000:When thou returnest, thou in this place wilt see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_21:0.9750:A work which is not here : a covenant 415
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_23:1.0000:Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_24:1.0000:And bear thy memory with me to the grave."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_25:0.9500:The Shepherd ended here ; and Luke stooped down,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_26:0.9500:And, as his Father had requested, laid 420
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_27:0.9500:The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_28:0.9500:The Old Man's grief broke from him ; to his heart
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_29:1.0000:He pressed his son, he kissed him and wept \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_30:0.9750:And to the house together they returned.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_31:0.9500:Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace, 425
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0059_33:1.0000:Began his journey, and when he had reached
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_1:1.0000:The public way, he put on a bold face ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_2:1.0000:And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_3:0.9750:Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers, 430
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_4:0.9750:That followed him till he was out of sight.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_5:1.0000:A good report did from their Kinsman come,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_6:1.0000:Of Luke and his well-doing : and the Boy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_7:0.9750:Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_10:1.0000:Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_11:1.0000:So, many months passed on : and once again
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_12:0.9750:The Shepherd went about his daily work
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_15:1.0000:He to that valley took his way, and there
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_17:1.0000:To slacken in his duty ; and, at length
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_18:0.9500:He in the dissolute city gave himself 445
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_19:0.9500:To evil courses : ignominy and shame
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_20:1.0000:Fell on him, so that he was driven at last
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_21:1.0000:To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_22:0.9750:There is a comfort in the strength of love ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_25:1.0000:I have conversed with more than one who well
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_26:0.9500:Remember the Old Man, and what he was
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_27:1.0000:Years after he had heard this heavy news.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_28:0.9750:His bodily frame had been from youth to age 455
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_29:0.9750:Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_30:1.0000:He went, and still looked up towards the sun,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_31:1.0000:And listened to the wind ; and, as before,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0060_32:0.9750:Performed all kinds of labour for his Sheep,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_2:1.0000:And to that hollow Dell from time to time
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_3:0.9750:Did he repair, to build the Fold of which
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_4:1.0000:His flock had need. "Pis not forgotten yet
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_5:1.0000:The pity which was then in every heart
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_7:1.0000:That many and many a day he thither went,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_8:1.0000:And never lifted up a single stone.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_9:1.0000:There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_10:1.0000:Sitting alone, with that his faithful Dog,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_11:0.9750:Then old, beside him, lying at his feet. 470
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_12:1.0000:The length of full seven years, from time to time,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_13:1.0000:He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_14:1.0000:And left the work unfinished when he died.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_15:0.9500:Three years, or little more, did Isabel
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_16:0.9750:Survive her Husband : at her death the estate 475
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_17:0.9500:Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_19:1.0000:Is gone the ploughshare has been through the ground
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_20:1.0000:On which it stood ; great changes have been wrought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_21:0.9750:In all the neighbourhood : yet the Oak is left 480
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_22:1.0000:That grew beside their door ; and the remains
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0061_23:1.0000:Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_8:1.0000:With the slow motion of a summer's cloud ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_9:0.9750:He turned aside towards a vassal's door,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_11:0.9500:" Another horse ! " That shout the vassal heard
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_12:1.0000:And saddled his best steed, a comely gray
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_13:0.9750:Sir Walter mounted him ; he was the third
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_14:0.9750:Which he had mourited on that glorious day.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_18:1.0000:There is a doleful silence in the air.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_21:0.9500:But horse and man are vanished, one and all j
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_22:1.0000:Such race, I think, was never seen before.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_23:0.9500:Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_24:1.0000:Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_26:0.9500:Follow, and up the weary mountain strain.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_27:0.9750:The Knight hallooed, he cheered and chid them on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0062_28:0.9750:With suppliant gestures and upbraiclings stern ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_1:0.9750:Where is the throng, the tumult of the race ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_2:1.0000:The bugles that so joyfully were blown ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_3:0.9750:This Chase it looks not like an earthly Chase ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_6:0.9500:I will not stop to tell how far he fled,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_7:1.0000:Nor will I mention by what death he died ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_8:1.0000:But now the Knight beholds him lying dead.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_9:0.9750:Dismounting, then, he leaned against a thorn ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_11:0.9750:He neither cracked his whip, nor blew his horn,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_12:1.0000:But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_13:1.0000:Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_14:1.0000:Stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_15:0.9500:Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned ; 40
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_16:1.0000:And white with foam as if with cleaving sleet.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_17:1.0000:Upon his side the Hart was lying stretched :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_18:1.0000:His nostril touched a spring beneath a hill.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_19:0.9500:And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_20:0.9750:The waters of th spring were trembling still. 45
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_21:0.9750:And now, too happy for repose or rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_23:1.0000:Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_24:0.9500:And gazed and gazed upon that darling spot.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_27:0.9750:Three several hoof-marks which the limited Beast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0063_28:1.0000:Had left imprinted on the grassy ground.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_3:0.9750:Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_4:1.0000:Down to the very fountain where he lies.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_8:1.0000:A place of love for damsels that are coy.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_9:1.0000:" A cunning artist will I have to frame
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_10:1.0000:A basin for that Fountain in the dell !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_11:1.0000:And they who do make mention of the same,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_13:0.9500:" And, gallant Stag ! to make thy praises known,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_14:1.0000:Another monument shall here be raised ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_15:1.0000:Three several Pillars, each a rough-hewn stone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_16:1.0000:And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_18:0.9500:I will come hither with my Paramour ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_19:1.0000:And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_20:1.0000:We will make merry in that pleasant Bower.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_21:1.0000:" Till the foundations of the mountains fail
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_23:0.9500:The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_24:1.0000:And them who dwell among the woods of Tire !"
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_25:1.0000:Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0064_26:1.0000:With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_1:0.9750:Ere thrice the Moon into her port had steered,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_2:0.9750:A Cup of stone received the living Well :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_5:0.9750:And near the Fountain, flowers of stature tall
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_6:1.0000:With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_7:1.0000:Which soon composed a little sylvan Hall,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_8:0.9750:A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_11:1.0000:And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_12:1.0000:Made merriment within that pleasant Bower.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_15:0.9750:But there is matter for a second rhyme,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_16:1.0000:And I to this would add another tale.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_19:0.9500:To freeze the blood I have no ready arts : 100
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_21:1.0000:To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts. Uv$-u.a
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_22:0.9750:As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_23:0.9750:It chanced that I saw standing in a dell
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_26:0.9500:What this imported I could ill divine :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_27:1.0000:And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0065_28:0.9500:I saw three Pillars standing in a line,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_3:1.0000:So that you just might say, as then I said,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_4:1.0000:" Here in old time the hand of man hath been."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_6:0.9750:More doleful place did never eye survey ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_7:1.0000:It seemed as if the spring-time came not here,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_8:1.0000:And Nature here were willing to decay.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_9:1.0000:I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_12:1.0000:And what this place might be I then inquired.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_13:0.9500:The Shepherd stopped, and that same story told
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_14:1.0000:Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_16:0.9750:But something ails it now ; the spot is curst.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_17:1.0000:" You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_18:1.0000:Some say that they are beeches, others elms
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_23:0.9500:But as to the great Lodge ! you might as well
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_24:0.9750:Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_26:0.9500:Will wet his lip within that Cup of stone ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_27:1.0000:And oftentimes, when all are fast asleep,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0066_28:1.0000:This water doth send forth a dolorous groan.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_3:0.9750:I've guessed, when I've been sitting in the sun,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_4:1.0000:That it was all for that unhappy Hart.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_8:0.9500:O Master ! it has been a cruel leap.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_9:1.0000:" For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_10:1.0000:And in my simple mind we cannot tell
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_11:1.0000:What cause the Hart might have to love this place,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_13:0.9750:" Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_14:1.0000:Lulled by the Fountain in the summer- tide ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_15:1.0000:This water was perhaps the first he drank
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_16:0.9500:When he had wandered from his mother's side.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_18:1.0000:He heard the birds their morning carols sing ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_19:1.0000:And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_20:1.0000:Not half a furlong from that self-same spring.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0067_25:0.9500:" Gray-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_1:0.9500:The Being, that is in the clouds and air,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_2:0.9500:That is in the green leaves among the groves,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_7:0.9750:This is no common waste, no common gloom ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_8:1.0000:But Nature, in due course of time, once more
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_9:0.9750:Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_12:0.9750:But, at the coming of the milder day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_13:1.0000:These monuments shall all be overgrown.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_16:1.0000:Never to blend our pleasure or our pride
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_20:1.0000:A cry as of a dog or fox ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_21:1.0000:He halts and searches with his eyes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_22:1.0000:Among the scattered rocks ; '
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_23:1.0000:And now at distance can discern
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_24:1.0000:A stirring in a brake of fern ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_25:1.0000:And instantly a dog is seen,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0068_26:0.9750:Glancing through that covert green.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_2:0.9500:Its motions, too, are wild and shy ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_3:1.0000:With something, as the Shepherd thinks,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_4:0.9750:Unusual in its cry :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_7:1.0000:Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_8:0.9500:What is the Creature doing here 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_9:0.9500:It was a cove, a huge recess,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_13:0.9500:Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_14:1.0000:Remote from public road or dwelling
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_15:0.9750:Pathway, or cultivated land ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_16:0.9500:From trace of human foot or hand. 25
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_17:1.0000:There sometimes doth a leaping fish
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_18:1.0000:Send through the tarn a lonely chger ; 0^
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_19:1.0000:The crags repeat the raven's croak,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_20:1.0000:In symphony austere ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_22:1.0000:And mists that spread the flying shroud \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_23:1.0000:And sunbeams ; and the sounding blast,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_24:1.0000:That, if it could, would hurry past ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_25:0.9750:But that enormous barrier binds it fast.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_27:0.9500:The Shepherd stood : then makes his way
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_28:1.0000:Towards the Dog, o'er rocks and stones.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0069_29:0.9750:As quickly as he may ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_3:0.9750:The appalled discoverer with a sigh
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_4:1.0000:Looks round, to learn the history.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_5:1.0000:From those abrupt and perilous rocks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_6:0.9750:The Man had fallen, that place of fear !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_8:1.0000:It breaks, and all is clear :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_9:1.0000:He instantly recalled the name,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_10:1.0000:And who he was, and whence he came ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_11:0.9500:Remembered, too, the very day
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_13:1.0000:But hear a wonder, for whose sake -<
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_14:1.0000:This lamentable tale I tell 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_15:1.0000:A lasting monument of words
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_16:0.9500:This wonder merits well.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_18:0.9750:Repeating the same timid cry,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_19:0.9750:This Dog, had been through three months' space
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_20:0.9750:A dweller in that savage place.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_21:0.9750:Yes, proof was plain that, since the day
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_23:0.9500:The Dog had watched about the spot,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_24:1.0000:Or by his Master's side :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_25:1.0000:How nourished here through such long time
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0070_26:0.9750:He knows, who gave that love sublime ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_6:0.9500:But now the sun is rising calm and bright ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_7:1.0000:The birds are singing in the distant woods ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_8:1.0000:Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_11:0.9500:All things that love the sun ate out of doors ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_12:0.9750:The sky rejoices in the morning's birth ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_13:1.0000:The grass is bright with rain-drops ; on the moors
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_17:0.9750:Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_18:1.0000:I was a traveller then upon the moor ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_21:0.9750:Or heard them not, as happy as a boy :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_22:1.0000:The pleasant season did my heart employ :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_23:0.9750:My old remembrances went from me wholly ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_27:1.0000:As high as we have mounted in delight
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0071_28:1.0000:In our dejection do we sink as low,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_1:1.0000:I heard the Sky-lark warbling in the sky :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_2:1.0000:And I bethought me of the playful Hare :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_3:0.9750:Even such a happy child of earth am I ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_6:0.9750:But there may come another day to me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_7:0.9750:Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_10:0.9750:As if all^ needful things would come unsought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_11:1.0000:To genial faith, still rich in genial good :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_12:1.0000:But how can He expect that others should
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_13:0.9500:Build for him, sow for him, and at his call
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_15:0.9500:I thought of Chattel-ton, the marvellous Boy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_16:1.0000:The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_17:1.0000:Of Him who walked in glory and in joy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_18:0.9750:Following his plow, along the mountain-side :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_20:0.9500:We Poets in our youth begin in gladness ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_21:0.9750:But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_22:0.9750:Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_23:1.0000:A leading from above, a something given,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_25:1.0000:When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_26:1.0000:Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_27:1.0000:I saw a Man before me unawares :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_28:0.9500:The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0072_31:0.9500:Wonder to all who do the same espy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_5:0.9750:Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_6:0.9750:Nor all asleep in his extreme old age :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_10:1.0000:Of sickness felt by him in times long past,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_11:1.0000:A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_20:0.9500:Stirred with his Staff, and fixedly did look
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0073_31:0.9500:He answered, while a flash of mild surprise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_2:1.0000:But each in solemn order followed each,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_3:1.0000:With something of a lofty utterance drest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_4:1.0000:Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_5:1.0000:Of ordinary men : a stately speech ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_7:0.9500:Religious men, who give to God and Man their dues.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_8:0.9750:He told, that to these waters he had come
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_9:1.0000:To gather Leeches, being old and poor :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_10:0.9500:Employment hazardous and wearisome !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_14:1.0000:And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_15:0.9500:The Old-man still stood talking by my side;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_18:1.0000:And the whole Body of the Man did seem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_19:1.0000:Like one whom I had met with in a dream ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_22:1.0000:My former thoughts returned : the fear that kills;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_23:1.0000:And hope that is unwilling to be fed ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_24:1.0000:Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_25:0.9750:And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0074_30:1.0000:And said, that, gathering Leeches, far and wide
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_2:0.9500:" Once I could meet with theui on every side ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_3:0.9750:But they have dwindled long by slow decay ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_4:1.0000:Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_7:1.0000:In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_8:1.0000:About the weary moors continually,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0075_13:0.9500:And soon with this he other matter blended,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0077_4:0.9500:The blue deep thou wingest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0077_5:0.9750:And singing still dost soar, and soaring euer singest."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_1:0.9750:IN youth from rock to rock I went,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_2:1.0000:From hill to hill in discontent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_3:0.9750:Of pleasure high and turbulent,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_5:0.9750:But now my own delights I make,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_6:1.0000:My thirst at every rill can slake, ($ t
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_7:1.0000:And gladly Nature's love partake
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_10:1.0000:That thinly decks his few grey hairs;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_11:1.0000:Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_12:1.0000:That she may sun thee ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_13:1.0000:Whole summer-fields are thine by right ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_15:0.9750:Doth in thy crimson head delight
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_16:1.0000:When rains are on thee.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_17:1.0000:In shoals and bands, a morrice train,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_18:1.0000:Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_20:0.9750:Yet nothing daunted,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_21:1.0000:Nor grieved, if thou be set at nought :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_22:1.0000:And oft alone in nooks remote
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_23:0.9750:We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_26:0.9750:The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0079_27:0.9500:Proud be the rose, with rains and dews
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_3:1.0000:Yet hast not gone without thy fam j ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_4:1.0000:Thou art indeed by many a claim
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_5:0.9500:The Poet's darling.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_9:1.0000:Near the green holly,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_10:1.0000:And wearily at length should fare ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_11:1.0000:He needs but look about, and there
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_12:0.9500:Thou art ! a friend at hand, to scare 40
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_14:1.0000:A hundred times, by rock or bower,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_15:1.0000:Ere thus I have lain crouched an hour,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_16:0.9500:Have I derived from thy sweet power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_19:1.0000:Some memory that had taken night j
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_20:1.0000:Some chime of fancy wrong or right ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_24:1.0000:I drink out of an humbler urn
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_25:1.0000:A lowlier pleasure ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_26:0.9750:The homely sympathy that heeds
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_28:1.0000:A wisdom fitted to the needs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0080_31:0.9750:When thou art up, alert and gay,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_1:0.9750:With kindred gladness :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_2:1.0000:And when, at dusk, by dews opprest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_3:1.0000:Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_4:0.9500:Hath often eased my pensive breast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_6:1.0000:And all day long I number yet,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_7:1.0000:All seasons through, another debt,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_8:1.0000:Which I, wherever thou art met,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_9:0.9500:To thee am owing ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_11:0.9500:A happy, genial influence,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_12:0.9500:Coming one knows not how, nor whence,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_13:1.0000:Nor whither going.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_14:0.9500:Child of the .Year ! that round dost run
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_16:0.9500:And cheerful when the day's 'begun
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_17:0.9500:As lark or leveret,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_18:1.0000:Thy long-lost praise* thou shalt regain ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_19:0.9750:Nor be less dear to future men
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_20:0.9500:Than in old times j thou not in vain 80
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_23:1.0000:BRIGHT flower, whose home is everywhere !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_24:0.9500:A Pilgrim bold in Nature's care,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_25:1.0000:And oft, the long year through, the heir
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_26:0.9750:Of joy or sorrow ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_27:1.0000:Methinks that there abides in thee
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_28:1.0000:Some concord with humanity,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0081_29:1.0000:Given to no other flower I see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_2:0.9750:A thoughtless Thing ! who, once unblest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_3:1.0000:Does little on his memory rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_4:0.9750:Or on his reason ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_5:1.0000:But Thou would'st teach him how to find
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_7:0.9750:A hope for times that are unkind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_12:1.0000:Of beauty is thy earthly dower !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_14:0.9500:Their utmost bounty on thy head :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_15:0.9750:And these grey Rocks ; this household Lawn ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_16:0.9750:These Trees, a veil just half withdrawn ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_17:0.9750:This fall of water, that doth make
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_19:0.9750:This little Bay, a quiet road
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_20:1.0000:That holds in shelter thy abode ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_21:1.0000:In truth together do ye seem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_22:0.9750:Like something fashioned in a dream ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_24:1.0000:When earthly cares are laid asleep !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_25:1.0000:Yet, dream and vision .las thou art,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_26:1.0000:I bless thee with a human heart :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_27:1.0000:God shield thee to thy latest years !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0082_29:0.9750:And yet my eyes are filled witli tears.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_1:0.9750:With earnest feeling I shall pray
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_2:1.0000:For thee when I am far away :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_3:1.0000:For never saw I mien, or face,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_6:1.0000:Ripening in perfect innocence.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_7:0.9750:Here scattered like a random seed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_8:1.0000:Remote from men, Thou dost not need
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_10:0.9500:And maidenly shamefacedness :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_11:1.0000:Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_12:1.0000:The freedom of a Mountaineer :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_13:1.0000:A face with gladness overspread !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_15:0.9750:And seemliness complete, that sways
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_16:1.0000:Thy courtesies, about thee plays ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_17:1.0000:With no restraint, but such as springs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_18:0.9750:From quick and eager visitings
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_20:0.9750:Of thy few words of English speech : *
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_21:1.0000:A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_22:1.0000:That gives thy gestures grace and life !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_23:1.0000:So have I, not unmoved in mind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_25:0.9750:Thus beating up against the wind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_26:1.0000:What hand but would a garland cull
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_27:1.0000:For thee who art so beautiful 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_28:1.0000:O happy pleasure ! here to dwell
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_30:0.9500:Adopt your homely ways, and dress,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_31:1.0000:A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_32:1.0000:But I could frame a wish for thee
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0083_33:1.0000:More like a grave reality :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_2:1.0000:Of the wild sea : and I would have
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_3:1.0000:Some claim upon thee, if I could,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_4:1.0000:Though but of common neighbourhood.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_5:0.9750:What joy to hear thee, and to see !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_8:1.0000:Now thanks to Heaven ! that of its grace
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_9:1.0000:Hath led me to this lonely place.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_10:0.9500:Joy have I had ; and going hence
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_12:0.9500:In spots like these it is we prize
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_13:1.0000:Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_14:1.0000:Then, why should I be loth to stir ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_15:0.9750:I feel this place was made for her ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_16:0.9500:To give new pleasure like the past, 70
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_17:1.0000:Continued long as life shall last.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_18:1.0000:Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_20:0.9750:For I, methinks, till I grow old,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_22:1.0000:As I do now, the Cabin small,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_23:0.9500:The Lake, the Bay, the Waterfall ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0084_24:0.9500:And Thee, the Spirit of them all !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_3:1.0000:Were in this place the guests of Chance :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_4:1.0000:Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_5:0.9750:Though home or shelter he had none,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_7:0.9750:The dewy ground was dark and cold ; 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_8:1.0000:Behind, all gloomy to behold ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_9:1.0000:And stepping westward seemed to be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_10:1.0000:A kind of heavenly destiny :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_11:0.9750:I liked the greeting ; 'twas a sound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_13:1.0000:And seemed to give me spiritual right
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_14:1.0000:To travel through that region bright.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_15:1.0000:The voice was soft, and she who spake
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_16:1.0000:Was walking by her native Lake :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_18:1.0000:The very sound of courtesy :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_19:1.0000:Its power was felt ; and while my eye
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_20:0.9500:Was fixed upon the glowing sky,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_21:0.9750:The echo of the voice enwrought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_23:0.9750:Of travelling through the world that lay
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_24:1.0000:Before me in my endless way.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_26:1.0000:BEHOLD her, single in the field,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_28:0.9750:Reaping and singing by herself ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0087_29:1.0000:Stop here, or gently pass !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_1:0.9500:A.I one .she cuts, and binds the grain,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_2:1.0000:And sings a melancholy strain ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_3:0.9500:listen ! for the Yale profound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_7:0.9750:Of Travellers in some shady haunt,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_8:1.0000:Among Arabian sands :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_9:1.0000:A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_12:1.0000:Among the farthest Hebrides.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_13:1.0000:Will no one tell me what she sings ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_17:1.0000:Or is it some more humble lay,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_18:1.0000:Familiar matter of to-day ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_19:0.9750:Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_20:0.9500:That has been, and may be again ! 2f>
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_21:0.9750:What'er the theme, the Maiden sang
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_22:1.0000:As if her song could have no ending ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_23:1.0000:1 saw her singing at her work,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_26:0.9500:And when I mounted up the hill,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_27:1.0000:The music in my heart I bore,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0088_28:1.0000:Long after it was heard no more.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_7:1.0000:Strike pleasure dead,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_8:1.0000:So sadness comes from out the mould
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_12:1.0000:As if it were thyself that's here
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_13:0.9500:I shrink with pain ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_14:0.9500:And both my wishes and my fear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_17:1.0000:Dark^ thoughts ! they came, but not to stay \o^*
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_18:1.0000:With chastened feelings would I pay
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_19:0.9750:The tribute due
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_22:1.0000:Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_23:1.0000:He sang, his genius " glinted " forth.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_24:1.0000:Rose like a star that touching earth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0089_27:0.9750:With matchless beams.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_1:1.0000:The piercing eye, the thoughtful brow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_4:1.0000:The prompt, the brave,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_5:1.0000:Slept, with the obscurest, in the low
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_6:1.0000:And silent grave.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_7:0.9500:Well might I mourn that He was gone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_10:1.0000:It showed my youth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_11:1.0000:How Verse may build a princely throne
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_14:0.9750:Regret pursues and with it blends,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_16:0.9500:By Skiddaw seen,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_19:0.9500:True friends though diversely inclined;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_20:1.0000:But heart with heart, and mind with mind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_21:1.0000:Where the main fibres are entwined,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_25:0.9750:The tear will start, and let it flow ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0090_26:0.9500:Thou " poor Inhabitant below,"
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_1:0.9750:What treasures would have then been placed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_2:1.0000:Within my reach ; of knowledge graced
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_3:0.9500:By fancy what a rich repast ! 60
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_5:1.0000:Oh ! spare to sweep, thou mournful blast,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_6:0.9750:His grave grass-grown.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_7:0.9500:There, too, a Son, his joy and pride,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_14:0.9750:Hath early found among the dead,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_15:1.0000:Harboured where none can be misled,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_16:1.0000:Wronged, or distrest ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_17:0.9750:And surely here it may be said ^*
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_19:0.9500:And oh for Thee, by pitying grace
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_20:0.9750:Checked oft-times in a devious race,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_21:0.9500:May He, who halloweth the place
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_25:0.9750:Sighing I turned away ; but ere
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0091_26:0.9750:Night fell, I heard, or seemed to hear,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_4:0.9500:Too frail to keep the lofty vow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_7:0.9750:With holly spray, -
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_8:0.9750:He faultered, drifted to and fro,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_11:1.0000:Our minds when, lingering all too long,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_12:1.0000:Over the grave of Burns we hung
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_17:1.0000:Where gentlest judgments may misdeem,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_18:0.9750:And prompt to welcome every gleam
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_19:0.9500:Of good and fair,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_22:1.0000:Enough of sorrow, wreck, and blight :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0092_23:1.0000:Think rather of those moments bright
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_2:0.9500:Freely as in youth's season bland,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_4:0.9750:We wont to stray,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_5:1.0000:Our pleasure varying at command
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_6:0.9500:Of each sweet Lay.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_7:0.9750:How oft inspired must he have trode
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_8:0.9500:These pathways, yon far- stretching road ! 35
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_10:0.9750:With mirth elate,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_11:1.0000:Or in his nobly-pensive mood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_15:0.9750:And ask of Nature, from what cause,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_16:1.0000:And by what rules
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_17:0.9750:She trained her Burns to win applause
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_20:1.0000:Are felt the flashes of his pen :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_21:1.0000:He rules mid winter snows, and when
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_22:0.9750:Bees fill their hives :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_24:0.9500:His power survives.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_25:0.9750:What need of fields in some far clime
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0093_27:0.9500:And all that fetched the flowing rhyme
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_2:1.0000:This Minstrel lead, his sins forgiven ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_4:1.0000:With vain endeavour,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_5:1.0000:And memory of Earth's bitter leaven
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_6:0.9750:Effaced for ever.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_10:1.0000:With all that live ]
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_11:1.0000:The best of what we do and are,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_12:0.9500:Just God, forgive !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_14:1.0000:BLITHE New-comer ! I have heard,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_15:0.9500:1 hear thee and rejoice.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_18:1.0000:While I am lying on the grass
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_19:1.0000:Thy twofold shout I hear ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_20:1.0000:From hill to hill it seems to pass,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_21:0.9500:At once far off and near.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_23:1.0000:Of sunshine and of flowers,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_24:1.0000:Thou bringest unto me a tale
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_25:1.0000:Of visionary hours.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0094_29:0.9750:A voice, a mystery ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_4:0.9500:In bush, and tree, and sky.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_5:1.0000:To seek thee did I often rove
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_6:0.9750:Through woods and on the green ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_7:1.0000:And thou wert still a hope, a love ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_9:0.9500:And I can listen to thee yet ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_10:1.0000:Can lie upon the plain
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_11:1.0000:And listen, till I do beget
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_12:0.9750:That golden time again.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_15:0.9750:An unsubstantial, faery place ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_19:1.0000:AND is this Yarrow ? This the Stream
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_20:1.0000:Of which my fancy cherished,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_22:1.0000:An image that hath perished !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_23:0.9750:O that some Minstrel's harp were near,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_24:1.0000:To utter notes of gladness,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0095_25:1.0000:And chase this silence from the air,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_1:0.9500:Yet why 1 a silvery current flows
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_2:0.9750:With uncontrolled meanderings ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_3:1.0000:Nor have these eyes by greener hills
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_6:0.9500:Is visibly delighted ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_7:0.9750:For not a feature of those hills
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_8:1.0000:Is in the mirror slighted.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_9:1.0000:A blue sky bends o'er Yarrow vale,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_11:0.9500:Is round the rising sun diffused,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_12:1.0000:A tender hazy brightness ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_13:0.9750:Mild dawn of promise 1 that excludes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_14:0.9500:All profitless dejection ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_17:0.9750:Where was it that the famous Flower
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_18:0.9500:Of Yarrow Yale lay bleeding ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_19:0.9750:His bed perchance was yon smooth mound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_22:1.0000:Now peaceful as the morning,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_23:1.0000:The Water-wraith ascended thrice
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_24:0.9500:And gave his doleful warning.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_26:0.9750:The haunts of happy Lovers,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_27:1.0000:The path that leads them to the grove,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_28:1.0000:The leafy grove that covers :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0096_31:0.9500:The unconquerable strength of love \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_1:1.0000:But thou, that didst appear so fair
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_4:0.9750:Her delicate creation :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_5:1.0000:Meek loveliness is round thee spread,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_6:1.0000:A softness still and holy ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_7:1.0000:The grace of forest charms decayed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_10:1.0000:Rich groves of lofty stature,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_11:0.9750:With Yarrow winding through the pomp
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_12:0.9750:Of cultivated nature ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_14:0.9500:Behold a Ruin hoary !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_15:1.0000:The shattered front of Newark's Towers,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_16:1.0000:Renowned in Border story.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_17:1.0000:Fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_19:1.0000:For manhood to enjoy his utrengbh ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_20:1.0000:And age to wear away in !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_21:0.9750:Yon Cottage seems a bower of bliss,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_22:1.0000:A covert for protection
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_24:1.0000:The brood of chaste affection.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_25:1.0000:How sweet, on this autumnal day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_26:1.0000:The wild-wood fruits to gather,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_27:0.9750:And on my True-love's forehead plant
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_30:0.9750:Twere no offence to reason ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0097_32:1.0000:To meet the wintry season.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_2:1.0000:Loved Yarrow, have I won thee ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_3:1.0000:A ray of Fancy still survives
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_4:1.0000:Her sunshine plays upon thee !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_8:1.0000:Accordant to the measure.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_9:1.0000:The vapours linger around the Heights,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_10:0.9750:They melt and soon must vanish ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_13:1.0000:But that I know, where'er I go.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_14:1.0000:Thy genuine image. Yarrow !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_15:0.9750:Will dwell with me to heighten joy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_20:1.0000:For thy song, Lark, is strong ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_24:1.0000:Lift me, guide me till I find
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_25:1.0000:That spot which seems so to thy mind !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_26:1.0000:I have walked through wildernesses dreary,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0098_29:0.9500:Up to thee would I fly.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0099_1:0.9750:And, singing, startle the dull night,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0099_3:0.9500:Till the dappled dawn doth rise. "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_1:0.9500:There's madness about thee, and joy divine
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_2:1.0000:In that song of thine ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_5:1.0000:Joyous as morning,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_6:1.0000:Thou art laughing and scorning ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_7:0.9750:Thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_10:0.9750:To be such a traveller as I.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_12:0.9750:With a soul as strong as a mountain River
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_14:0.9500:Joy and jollity be with us both !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_15:1.0000:Alas ! my journey, rugged and uneven,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_16:1.0000:Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_17:0.9750:But hearing thee, or others of thy kind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_18:0.9750:As full of gladness and as free of heaven, 30
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_19:0.9750:I, with my fate contented, will plod on,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_20:0.9500:And hope for higher raptures, when Life's day is done.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_23:0.9750:Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_24:1.0000:Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_25:0.9500:Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0101_26:1.0000:Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_1:0.9500:To the last point of vision, and beyond,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_2:0.9500:Mount, daring Warbler ! that love-prompted strain,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_4:0.9500:Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_5:1.0000:Yet might'st thou seem, proud privilege ! to sing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_6:1.0000:All independent of the leafy spring.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_7:0.9750:Leave to the Nightingale her shady wood ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_9:0.9750:Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_10:1.0000:Of harmony, with instinct more divine ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0102_11:0.9750:Type of the wise who soar, but never roam ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0103_6:1.0000:Action and joy / An Orphic song indeed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0103_7:1.0000:A song diuinr. of high and passionate thoughts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0103_8:0.9750:To their own music chanted/"
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_5:0.9750:Who art a light to guide, a rod
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_8:0.9750:When empty terrors overawe ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_9:1.0000:From vain temptations dost set free ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_10:0.9500:And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_12:0.9500:Be on them ); who, in love and truth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_13:0.9500:Where no misgiving is, rely
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_14:1.0000:Upon the genial sense of youth :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_18:0.9750:But Thou, if they should totter, teach them to stand fast !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_20:0.9500:And happy will our nature be,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_23:1.0000:And they a blissful course may hold
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_24:0.9750:Even now, who, (not unwisely bold,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0105_25:1.0000:Live in the spirit of this creed ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_1:1.0000:I, loving freedom, and untried ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_2:1.0000:No sport of every random gust,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_3:1.0000:Yet being to myself a guide,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_4:1.0000:Too blindly have reposed my trust ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_7:1.0000:The task, in smoother walks to stray
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_8:0.9500:But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_12:1.0000:But in the quietness of thought :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_13:1.0000:Me this unchartered freedom tires ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_14:0.9750:I feel the weight of chance-desires :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_16:1.0000:I long for a repose that ever is the same.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_17:1.0000:Stern Lawgiver ! yet thou dost wear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_18:1.0000:The Godhead's most benignant grace ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_19:0.9500:Nor know we anything so fair
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_21:0.9500:Flowers laugh before thee on their beds
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_22:1.0000:And fragrance in thy footing treads ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_27:1.0000:Unto thy guidance from this hour ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_28:1.0000:Oh, let my weakness have an end !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0106_32:0.9500:And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_6:0.9750:Apparelled in celestial light,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_11:0.9500:The things which I have seen I now can see no mora
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_13:0.9500:The Rainbow comes and goes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_16:1.0000:Look round her when the heavens are bare ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_17:0.9750:Waters on a starry night
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_27:0.9750:To me alone there came a thought of grief :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0107_28:1.0000:A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_2:1.0000:No more shall grief of mine the season wrong ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_3:1.0000:I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_4:1.0000:The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_8:1.0000:And with the heart of May
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_9:1.0000:Doth every beast keep holiday ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_14:0.9750:Ye blessed Creatures, I have heard the call
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_15:1.0000:Ye to each other make ; I see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_16:0.9500:The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_18:1.0000:My head hath its coronal,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_19:1.0000:The fulness of your bliss, I feel I feel it all.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_20:1.0000:O evil day ! if I were sullen
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_24:0.9750:On every side,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_25:0.9750:In a thousand valleys far and wide,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_26:0.9500:Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_27:0.9500:And the babe leaps up on his mother's arm : 55
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_28:0.9750:I hear, I hear, with joy I hear !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_29:1.0000:But there's a Tree, of many one,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0108_30:1.0000:A single Field which I have looked upon,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_6:1.0000:Hath had elsewhere its setting,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_7:1.0000:And cometh from afar :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_8:0.9750:Not in entire forgetfulness,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_10:0.9500:But trailing clouds of glory do we come
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_11:1.0000:From God, who is our home :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_12:1.0000:Heaven lies about us in our infancy !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_19:0.9750:And by the vision splendid
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0109_22:0.9750:And fade into the light of common day.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_4:0.9750:See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies, 95
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_5:0.9750:Fretted by sallies of his Mother's kisses,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_6:1.0000:With light upon him from his Father's eyes !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_7:1.0000:See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_8:1.0000:Some fragment from his dream of human life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_10:0.9750:A wedding or a festival,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_11:0.9750:A mourning or a funeral,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_12:1.0000:And this hath now his heart,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_13:0.9500:And unto this he frames his song :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_16:0.9750:But it will not be long
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_17:1.0000:Ere this be thrown aside,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_21:1.0000:With all the persons, down to palsied age,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_22:1.0000:That Life brings with her in her equipage ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_30:1.0000:That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0110_31:0.9750:Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_5:0.9500:Broods like the day, a master o'er a slave,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_9:1.0000:Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_10:0.9500:The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_12:0.9500:Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight, 135
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_16:0.9750:O joy ! that in our embers
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_19:0.9750:What was so fugitive !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_20:1.0000:The thought of our past years in me doth breed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_24:0.9500:Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_25:1.0000:With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0111_30:0.9750:Fallings from us, vanishings ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_1:1.0000:Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_2:0.9750:But for those first affections,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_5:0.9750:Are yet the fountain light of all our day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_6:1.0000:Are yet a master light of all our seeing ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_7:1.0000:Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_8:0.9750:Our noisy years seem moments in the being
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_10:0.9750:To perish never ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_11:1.0000:Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_13:0.9500:Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_15:0.9500:Hence, in a season of calm weather,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_16:1.0000:Though inland far we be,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_17:1.0000:Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_20:1.0000:And see the children sport upon the shore,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_21:1.0000:And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_25:1.0000:We in thought will join your throng,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_26:1.0000:Ye that pipe and ye that play,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_27:0.9750:Ye that through your hearts to-day
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_29:0.9750:What though the radiance which was once so bright
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_30:0.9500:Be now for ever taken from my sight,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_31:1.0000:Though nothing can bring back the hour
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0112_32:0.9750:Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_3:0.9750:Strength in what remains behind ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_4:1.0000:In the primal sympathy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_5:1.0000:Which having been must ever be,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_6:1.0000:In the soothing thoughts that spring
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_8:1.0000:In the faith that looks through death,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_9:0.9750:In years that bring the philosophic mind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_15:1.0000:To live beneath your more habitual sway.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_20:1.0000:The Clonds that gather round the setting sun
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_24:1.0000:Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_25:1.0000:Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_29:0.9750:WHO is the happy Warrior? Who is he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_30:1.0000:That every man in arms should wish to be ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0113_31:1.0000:It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_4:0.9750:Whose high endeavours are an inward light
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_5:0.9500:That makes the path before him always bright :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_6:0.9500:Who, with a natural instinct to discern
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_9:1.0000:3But makes his moral being his prime care ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_10:1.0000:Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_13:0.9750:In face of these doth exercise a powder
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_14:1.0000:Which is our human nature's highest dower ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_16:0.9500:Of their bad influence, and their good receives :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_19:1.0000:Is placable because occasions rise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_20:1.0000:So often that demand such sacrifice \
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_21:1.0000:More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_23:0.9500:As more exposed to suffering and distress ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_24:1.0000:Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_25:1.0000:Tis he whose law is reason ; who depends
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_26:0.9750:Upon that law as on the best of friends ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_28:0.9750:To evil for a guard against worse ill,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_29:1.0000:And what in quality or act is best
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_30:0.9500:Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_31:0.9750:He fixes good on good alone, and owes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_32:0.9500:To virtue every triumph that he knows : 40
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_33:0.9750:Who, if he rise to station of command,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_34:0.9750:Rises by open means, and there will stand
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0114_35:0.9500:On honourable terms, or else retire,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_2:0.9500:Who comprehends his trust, and to the same 40
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_3:0.9750:Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_4:1.0000:And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_5:1.0000:For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_6:1.0000:Whom they must follow ? on whose head must fall,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_7:0.9500:Like showers of manna, if they come at all : 45
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_8:1.0000:Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_9:1.0000:Or mild concerns of ordinary life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_10:1.0000:A constant influence, a peculiar grace ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_11:1.0000:But who, if he be called upon to face
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_12:0.9500:Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined 50
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_13:0.9750:Great issues, good or bad for human kind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_14:1.0000:Is happy as a lover ; and attired
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_15:1.0000:With sudden brightness, like a man inspired ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_17:0.9500:Tn calmness made, and sees what he foresaw ; 55
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_18:0.9750:Or if an unexpected call succeed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_19:1.0000:Come when it will, is equal to the need :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_20:1.0000:He who though thus endued as with a sense ^
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_21:0.9750:And faculty for storm and turbulence,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_23:0.9750:To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_24:0.9750:Sweet images ! which, wheresoever he be,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_25:1.0000:Are at his heart ; and such fidelity
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_26:0.9750:It is his darling passion to approve ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_28:0.9500:Tis, finally, the man, who, lifted high,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_29:1.0000:Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_30:0.9750:Or left unthought-of in obscurity,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0115_34:0.9500:Where what he most doth value must be won :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_1:0.9750:Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_2:1.0000:Nor thought of tender happiness betray ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_4:0.9750:Looks forward, persevering to the last,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_5:1.0000:From well to better, daily self-surpast :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_6:1.0000:Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_7:1.0000:For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_9:0.9500:And leave a dead unprofitable name,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_10:1.0000:Finds comfort in himself and in his cause ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_11:0.9750:And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0116_12:0.9750:His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_6:1.0000:These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_7:1.0000:With a sweet inland murmer.* Once again
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_8:1.0000:Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_9:0.9500:That on a wild secluded scene impress 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_10:0.9750:Thoughts of more deep seclusion ; and connect
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_11:1.0000:The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_12:1.0000:The day is come when I again repose
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_13:0.9750:Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_15:1.0000:Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_16:1.0000:Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_17:1.0000:Among the woods and copses, nor disturb
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_18:1.0000:The wild green landscape. Once again I see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_19:0.9500:These hedgerows, hardly hedgerows, little lines 20
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_20:0.9750:Of sportive wood run wild : these pastoral farms,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_21:1.0000:Green to the very door ; and wreaths of smoke
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_22:1.0000:Sent up, in silence, from among the trees !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_23:1.0000:With some uncertain notice, as might seem
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_24:0.9500:Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, 25
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_25:0.9750:Or of some Hermit's cave, where by his fire
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0119_26:0.9500:The Hermit sits alone.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_2:1.0000:But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_3:1.0000:Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_4:1.0000:In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_5:0.9750:Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_7:0.9750:With tranquil restoration : feelings too
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_8:1.0000:Of unremembered pleasure : such, perhaps,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_9:1.0000:As have no slight or trivial influence
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_10:0.9750:On that best portion of a good man's life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_12:0.9750:Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_13:1.0000:To them I may have owed another gift,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_14:1.0000:Of aspect more sublime ; that blessed mood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_15:0.9500:In which the burthen of the mystery,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_16:0.9500:In which the heavy and the weary weight 45
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_17:0.9750:Of all this unintelligible world,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_18:1.0000:Is lightened : that serene and blessed mood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_19:1.0000:In which the affections gently lead us on,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_20:0.9750:Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_22:0.9500:Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_23:1.0000:In body, and become a living soul :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_24:1.0000:While with an eye made quiet by the power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_25:0.9750:Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_28:0.9500:Be but a vain belief, yet, oh ! how oft,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_29:1.0000:In darkness, and amid the many shapes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_30:0.9500:Of joyless daylight ; when the fretful stir
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_31:0.9500:Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, CO
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0120_33:1.0000:How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_2:1.0000:And now, with gleams of half extinguished thought, 65
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_3:1.0000:With many recognitions dim and faint,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_4:1.0000:And somewhat of a sad perplexity,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_5:0.9750:The picture of the mind revives again :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_6:1.0000:While here I stand, not only with the sense
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_7:1.0000:Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts 70
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_8:1.0000:That in this moment there is life and foocl
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_9:0.9750:For future years. And so I dare to hope,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_10:0.9750:Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_11:0.9500:I came among these hills ; when like a roe
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_13:1.0000:Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_14:1.0000:Wherever nature led : more like a man
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_15:0.9750:Flying from something that he dreads, than one
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_16:1.0000:Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_18:0.9500:And their glad animal movements all gone by)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_19:1.0000:To me was all in all. I cannot paint
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_20:1.0000:What then I was. The sounding cataract
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_21:1.0000:Haunted me like a passion : the tall rock,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_22:0.9750:The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, 85
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_23:1.0000:Their colours and their forms, were then to me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_24:1.0000:An appetite ; a feeling and a love,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_25:0.9500:That had no need of a remoter charm,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_26:0.9750:By thought supplied, or any interest
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_27:0.9500:UnboiTOwed from the eye. That time is past, 90
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_29:1.0000:And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_30:1.0000:Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur ; other gifts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_31:1.0000:Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_33:0.9500:To look on nature, not as in the hour
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0121_34:0.9750:Of thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_1:0.9750:The still, sad music of humanity,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_2:1.0000:Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_4:0.9750:A presence that disturbs me with the joy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_5:1.0000:Of elevated thoughts : a sense sublime
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_6:1.0000:Of something far more deeply interfused,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_7:1.0000:Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_8:0.9500:And the round ocean and the living air, 105
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_9:0.9750:And the blue sky, and in the mind of man :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_10:1.0000:A motion and a spirit, that impels
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_11:1.0000:All thinking things, all objects of all thought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_12:1.0000:And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_14:1.0000:And mountains ; and of all that we behold
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_15:1.0000:From this green earth ; of all the mighty world
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_16:1.0000:Of eye and ear, both what they half create,*
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_17:1.0000:And what perceive ; well pleased to recognise
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_24:1.0000:Suffer my genial spirits to decay :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_25:1.0000:For thou art with me, here, upon the banks
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_26:1.0000:Of this fair river ; thou, my dearest Friend,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_27:1.0000:My dear, dear Friend, and in thy voice I catch
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_29:1.0000:My former pleasures in the shooting lights
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_30:0.9750:Of thy wild eyes. Oh ! yet a little while
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0122_31:1.0000:May I behold in thee what I was once,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_2:1.0000:The heart that loved her ; 'tis her privilege,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_3:0.9500:Through all the years of this our life, to lead
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_4:1.0000:From joy to joy : for she can so inform
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_5:0.9500:The mind that is within us, so impress
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_6:0.9750:With quietness and beauty, and so feed 135
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_7:1.0000:With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_8:1.0000:Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_9:1.0000:Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_10:1.0000:The dreary intercourse of daily life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_12:1.0000:Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_13:1.0000:Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_14:1.0000:Shine on thee in thy solitary walk ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_15:1.0000:And let the misty mountain winds be free
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_16:1.0000:To blow against thee : and in after years, 145
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_17:1.0000:When these wild ecstasies shall be matured
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_18:1.0000:Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_19:1.0000:Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_20:0.9750:Thy memory be as a dwelling-place
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_21:0.9500:For all sweet sounds and harmonies ; oh ! then, 150
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_22:1.0000:If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_23:1.0000:Should l$e> thy portion, with what healing thoughts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_24:1.0000:Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_25:1.0000:And these my exhortations ! Nor, perchance
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_27:0.9500:Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_28:0.9750:Of past existence, wilt thou then forget
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_29:0.9750:That on the banks of this delightful stream
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_30:1.0000:We stood together ; and that I, so long
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_32:0.9500:Unwearied in that service : rather say
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_33:0.9750:With warmer love, oh ! with far deeper zeal
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0123_34:0.9750:Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_3:0.9750:And this green pastoral landscape, were to me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_4:0.9500:More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_7:1.0000:WE talked with open heart, and tongue
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_11:1.0000:We lay beneath a spreading oak,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_12:1.0000:Beside a mossy seat ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_16:1.0000:This water's pleasant tune
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_17:1.0000:With some old Border-song, or Catch,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_20:0.9500:Sing here beneath the shade,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_21:1.0000:That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0124_26:1.0000:The grey -haired man of glee :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_2:0.9750:How merrily it goes !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_4:0.9500:And flow as now it flows.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_5:0.9750:" And here, on this delightful day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_6:1.0000:I cannot choose but think
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_7:0.9750:How oft, a vigorous man, I lay
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_9:0.9750:" My eyes are dim with childish tears,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_10:1.0000:My heart is idly stirred,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_11:1.0000:For the same sound is in my ears
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_12:1.0000:Which in those days I heard.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_14:0.9750:And yet the wiser mind
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_15:1.0000:Mourns less for what age takes away
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_16:1.0000:Than what it leaves behind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_19:0.9750:Let loose their carols when they please,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_20:1.0000:Are quiet when they will.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_21:1.0000:" With Nature never do they wage
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_22:1.0000:A foolish strife ; they see
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_23:0.9500:A happy youth, and their old age 45
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_25:0.9500:" But we are pressed by heavy laws ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_26:0.9750:And often, glad no more,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0127_27:0.9500:We wear a face of joy, because
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_1:0.9750:"If there be one who need bemoan
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_2:1.0000:His kindred laid in earth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_3:1.0000:The household hearts that were his own,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_6:0.9750:My life has been approved,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_7:1.0000:And many love me ; but by none
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_8:0.9750:Am I enough beloved."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_12:1.0000:Upon these happy plains,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_13:0.9750:" And, Matthew, for thy children dead
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_14:0.9500:I'll be a son to thee ! "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_17:1.0000:We rose up from the fountain-side ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_18:1.0000:And down the smooth descent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_22:1.0000:He sang those witty rhymes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_23:1.0000:About the crazy old church-clock,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0128_24:0.9750:And the bewildered chimes.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_4:0.9750:I WAS thy neighbour once, thou rujge-i Pile !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_6:0.9750:I saw thee every day ; and all the while
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_7:0.9750:Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_8:1.0000:So pure the sky, so quiet was the air !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_9:1.0000:So like, so very like, was day to day !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_11:1.0000:It trembled, but it never passed away.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_12:1.0000:How perfect was the calm ! it seemed no sleep ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_13:1.0000:No mood, which season takes away, or brings :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_14:0.9750:I could have fancied that the mighty Deep
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_17:1.0000:To express what then I saw ; and add the gleam,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_18:1.0000:The light that never was, on sea or land,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_19:1.0000:The consecration, and the Poet's dream ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_21:1.0000:Amid a world how different from this ! -
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_22:1.0000:Beside a sea that could not cease to smih ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_23:0.9750:On tranquil land, beneath a gky of bliss.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_27:0.9500:No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0131_28:0.9500:Or merely silent Nature's breathing life.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_1:1.0000:Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_2:1.0000:Such Picture would I at that time have made :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_4:0.9750:A stedfast peace that might not be betrayed.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_5:1.0000:So once it would have been, 'tis so no more ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_6:1.0000:I have submitted to a new control :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_7:0.9750:A power is gone, which nothing can restore ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_10:1.0000:A smiling sea, and be what I have been :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_11:1.0000:The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_12:0.9500:This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_14:0.9750:If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_15:1.0000:This work of thine I blame not, but commend ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_16:1.0000:Thitt sea in anger, and that dismal shore.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_19:0.9750:That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_20:1.0000:That rueful sky, thi,s pageantry of fear !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_21:1.0000:And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_23:0.9500:Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, 50
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_27:0.9500:Moused, in a dream, at distance from the Kind ! ^
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0132_28:0.9500:Such happiness, wherever it be known,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_1:0.9750:But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_2:1.0000:And frequent sights of what is to be borne !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_3:1.0000:Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.-
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_4:1.0000:Not without hope we suffer and we uaourn.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_7:1.0000:OH ! pleasant exercise of hope and joy !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_8:1.0000:For mighty were the auxiliars, which then stood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_9:1.0000:Upon our side, we who were strong in love !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_10:1.0000:Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_11:1.0000:But to be young was very heaven ! Oh ! times,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_12:1.0000:In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_13:1.0000:Of custom, law, and statute, took at once
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_15:1.0000:When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_16:1.0000:When most intent on making of herself
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_17:1.0000:A prime enchantress to assist the work,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_18:1.0000:Which then was going forward in ner name !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_19:0.9750:Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth, 15
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_20:1.0000:The beauty wore of promise that which sets
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_21:0.9750:(As at some moment might not be unfelt
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_22:0.9750:Among the bowers of paradise itself)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_23:0.9750:The budding rose above the rose full blown.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_25:0.9750:To happiness unthought of? The inert
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_26:1.0000:Were roused, and lively natures rapt away !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_27:0.9750:*Jhey who had fed their childhood upon dreams,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0133_28:0.9500:The playfellows of fancy, who had made
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_1:1.0000:Their ministers, who in lordly wise had stirred
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_2:1.0000:Among the grandest objects of the sense,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_3:1.0000:And dealt with whatsoever they found there
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_4:0.9750:As if they had witljjn some lurking right
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_6:1.0000:Had watched all gentle motions, and to these
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_7:1.0000:Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_8:0.9750:And in the region of their peaceful selves;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_11:0.9750:And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_12:1.0000:Were called upon to exercise their skill,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_16:1.0000:Of all of us, the place where in the end
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_20:1.0000:Of public business trained and bred ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_23:0.9750:A Lawyer art thou ? draw not nigh !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_24:1.0000:Go, carry to some fitter place
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_25:1.0000:The keenness of that practised eye,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_26:0.9500:The hardness of that sallow face.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_28:0.9500:A rosy Man, right plump to see ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_29:1.0000:Approach ; yet, Doctor, not too near
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0134_30:1.0000:This grave no cushion is for thee.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_3:1.0000:Welcome ! but lay thy sword aside,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_4:0.9750:And lean upon a peasant's staff.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_5:0.9750:Physician art thou ? One, all eyes,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_6:1.0000:Philosopher ! a fingering slave,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_9:0.9750:Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_10:1.0000:O turn aside, and take, I pray,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_11:0.9750:That he below may rest in peace,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_12:0.9750:That abject thing, thy soul, away ! 25
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_14:1.0000:Led, Heaven knows how ! to this poor sod :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_15:1.0000:And he has neither eyes nor ears ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_16:1.0000:Himself his world, and his own God ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_18:1.0000:Nor form, nor feeling, great or small ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_19:0.9750:A reasoning, self-sufficing thing,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_20:1.0000:An intellectual All-in-all !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_21:1.0000:Shut close the door ; press down the latch ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_22:0.9500:Sleep in thy intellectual crust ; 35
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_23:0.9500:Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_24:1.0000:Near this unprofitable dust.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_25:1.0000:But who is He, with modest looks,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0137_28:0.9750:A music sweeter than their own.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_1:1.0000:He is retired as noontide dew,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_2:1.0000:Or fountain in a noon-day grove :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_3:1.0000:And you must love him, ere to you
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_4:0.9750:He will seem worthy of your love. 45
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_5:0.9500:The outward shows of sky and earth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_6:0.9750:Of hill and valley, he has viewed ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_7:1.0000:And impulses of deeper birth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_8:0.9500:Have come to him in solitude.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_10:0.9500:Some random truths he can impart ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_11:1.0000:The harvest of a quiet eyejV
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_12:1.0000:That broods and sleeps on his own heart.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_13:0.9500:But he is weak ; both Man and Boy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_15:0.9500:Contented if he might enjoy
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_16:0.9750:The things which others understand.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_17:0.9750:Come hither in thy hour of strength ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0138_18:0.9500:Come, weak as is a breaking wave !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_2:1.0000:ONCE did she hold the gorgeous East in fee ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_3:1.0000:And was the safeguard of the West : the worth
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_6:0.9750:She was a Maiden City, bright and free ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_7:1.0000:No guile seduced, no force could violate ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_8:1.0000:And, when She took unto herself a Mate,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_10:1.0000:And what if she had seen those glories fade,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_11:1.0000:Those titles vanish, and that strength decay ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_12:1.0000:Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_13:1.0000:When her long life hath reached its final day :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_19:0.9500:One of the Mountains ; each a mighty Voice :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_22:1.0000:There came a Tyrant, and with holy glee
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_23:0.9500:Thou fought'st against Him ; but hast vainly striven;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_24:0.9750:Thou from the Alpine holds at length af driven,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0141_25:0.9500:Where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee. 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_2:0.9750:For, high-souled Maid, what sorrow would it be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_9:0.9750:CLARKSON ! it was an obstinate hill to climb :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_11:1.0000:Is known, by none, perhaps, so feelingly ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_12:1.0000:But Thou, who, starting in thy fervent prime,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_13:1.0000:Didst first lead forth this pilgrimage sublime,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_17:0.9750:Duty's intrepid liegeman, see, the palm ^<
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_18:1.0000:Is won, and by all Nations shall be worn !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_25:1.0000:Mindless of its just honours ; with this key
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0142_29:0.9750:Cambens soothed with it an exile's grief ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_2:1.0000:Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned"
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_3:1.0000:His visionary brow : a glow-worm lamp, 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_5:1.0000:To struggle through dark ways ; and, (when a damp '
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_7:1.0000:The Thing became a trumpet, whence he blew ,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_11:1.0000:NUNS fret not at their convent's narrow room,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_12:1.0000:And Hermits are contented with their cells,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_13:0.9750:And Students with their pensive citadels :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_16:0.9750:High as the highest Peak of Furness Fells,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_17:1.0000:Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_18:0.9500:In truth, the prison, unto which we doom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_19:0.9500:Ourselves, no prison is : and hence to me, 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_20:1.0000:In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_21:1.0000:Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_22:1.0000:Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_23:0.9750:Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_24:0.9500:Should find brief solace there, as I have found. 15
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_27:1.0000:To season my fireside with personal talk,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_28:1.0000:Of friends, who live within an easy walk,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_29:1.0000:Or neighbours, daily, weekly, in my sight :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0143_30:1.0000:And, for my chance-acquaintance, ladies bright,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_1:0.9750:Sons, mothers, maidens withering on the stalk,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_2:1.0000:These all wear out of me, like forms with chalk
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_5:0.9500:Long, barren silence, square with my desire ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_6:1.0000:To sit without emotion, hope, or aim,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_7:1.0000:In the loved presence of my cottage-fire,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_8:1.0000:And listen to the flapping of the flame,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_11:1.0000:WINGS have we, and as far as we can go
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_12:1.0000:We may find pleasure : wilderness and wood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_13:1.0000:Blank ocean and mere sky, support that mood
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_16:0.9500:Are a substantial world, both pure and good :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_17:0.9500:Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_18:1.0000:Our pastime and our happiness will grow.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_19:0.9750:There find I personal themes, a plenteous store, 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_21:1.0000:To which I listen with a ready ear ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_22:1.0000:Two shall be named, pre-eminently dear,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_26:0.9500:NOR can I not believe but that hereby
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_27:1.0000:Great gains are mine ; for thus I live remote
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_28:1.0000:From evil-speaking ; rancour, never sought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0144_29:1.0000:Comes to me not ; malignant truth, or lie.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_1:0.9750:Hence have I genial seasons, hence have I
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_2:1.0000:Smooth passions, smooth discourse, and joyous thought:
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_3:1.0000:And thus from day to day my little boat
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_5:0.9500:Blessings be with them and eternal praise, 10
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_6:0.9500:Who gave us nobler loves, and nobler cares
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_7:1.0000:The Poets, who on earth have made us heirs
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_8:1.0000:Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_9:1.0000:Oh ! might my name be numbered among theirs,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_12:1.0000:A FLOCK of sheep tfyat leisurely pass by,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_13:1.0000:One after one ; the sound of rain, and bees
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_14:0.9750:Murmuring ; the fall of rivers, winds and seas,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_15:0.9750:Smooth fields, white sheets of water, and pure sky, 5
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_16:0.9750:By turns have all been thought of, yet I lie
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_17:1.0000:Sleepless ; and soon the small birds' melodies
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_18:1.0000:Must hear, first uttered from my orchard trees ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_19:1.0000:And the first Cuckoo's melancholy cry.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_21:0.9500:And could not win-thee, Sleep ! by any stealth :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_22:1.0000:So do not let me wear to-night away :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_23:1.0000:Without Thee what is all the morning's wealth ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_24:0.9750:Come, blessed barrier between day and day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_28:0.9500:EARTH has not anything to show more fair :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0145_29:1.0000:Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_1:1.0000:A sight so touching in its majesty :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_2:1.0000:This City now doth like a garment wear
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_3:1.0000:The beauty of the morning ; silent, bare,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_4:1.0000:Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_5:1.0000:Open unto the fields, and to the sky ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_6:1.0000:All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_7:1.0000:Never did sun more beautifully steep
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0146_8:1.0000:In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill ;

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0219_22:1.0000:With momentary stars of my own birth,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0219_24:1.0000:Into the darkness ; now a tranquil sea,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0220_2:1.0000:I sate, my being blended in one thought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0220_3:1.0000:(Thought was it ? or aspiration ? or resolve ?)
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0220_4:0.9750:Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0220_5:0.9500:And when I rose, I found myself in prayer.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_2:1.0000:"There is sweet music here that softer fall
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_3:1.0000:Than petals from blown roses on the grass,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_4:1.0000:Or night dews on still waters between walls
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_5:1.0000:Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_6:1.0000:Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_7:1.0000:Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0221_8:0.9500:Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful shies. "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_5:0.9750:And I would that my tongue could utter
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_6:1.0000:The thoughts that arise in me.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_7:1.0000:O well for the fisherman's boy,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_8:1.0000:That he shouts with his sister at play !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_9:1.0000:O well for the sailor lad,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_10:1.0000:That he sings in his boat on the bay 1
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_11:1.0000:And the stately ships go on
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_12:1.0000:To their haven under the hill ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_13:1.0000:But O for the touch of a vanish 'd hand,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_14:1.0000:And the sound of a voice that is still !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_15:0.9750:Break, break, break,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0223_17:0.9750:But the tender grace of a day that is dead
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_2:1.0000:Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_3:0.9750:Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_4:1.0000:A great-sized monster of ingratitudes :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_5:0.9750:Those scraps are good deeds past ; which are devour'd,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_6:1.0000:As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_7:1.0000:As done : perseverance, dear my lord,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_8:0.9750:Keeps honour bright : to have done is to hang
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_9:0.9750:Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_10:1.0000:In monumental mockery. Take the instant way ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_14:0.9500:That one by one pursue : if you give way,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_15:1.0000:Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_16:0.9500:Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_18:0.9750:Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_22:0.9750:For time is like a fashionable host
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_23:1.0000:That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_24:0.9500:And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_25:0.9500:Grasps in the comer : welcome ever smiles,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_26:1.0000:And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_29:0.9750:High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_30:0.9500:Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0224_31:1.0000:To envious and calumniating time.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_18:0.9750:THE day that is the night of days,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_19:1.0000:With cannon-fire for sun ablaze,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_20:1.0000:We spy from any billow's lift ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_21:1.0000:And England still this tidal drift !
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_22:0.9750:Would she to sainted forethought vow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_23:0.9750:A space before the thunders flood,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_24:1.0000:That martyr of its hour might now
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_25:1.0000:Spare her the tears of blood ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_26:1.0000:Asleep upon her ancient deeds,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_27:1.0000:She hugs the vision plethora breeds,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_28:1.0000:And counts her manifold increase
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_29:1.0000:Of treasure in the fruits of peace.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_30:1.0000:What curse on earth's improvident,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_31:1.0000:When the dread trumpet shatters rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_32:1.0000:Is wreaked, she knows, yet smiles content
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0225_33:0.9750:. As cradle rocked from breast.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_2:1.0000:The valour of her offspring boasts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_3:1.0000:Mindless that now on land and main
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_4:0.9750:His heeded prayer is active brain.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_5:1.0000:No more great heart may guard the home,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_6:1.0000:Save eyed and armed and skilled to cleave
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_7:0.9750:Yon swallower wave with shroud of foam,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_8:0.9750:We see not distant heave.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_9:1.0000:They stand to be her sacrifice,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_10:1.0000:The sons this mother flings like dice,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_11:1.0000:To face the odds and brave the Fatesj
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_12:1.0000:As in those days of starry dates,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_13:1.0000:When cannon cannon's counterblast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_14:0.9750:Awakened, muzzle muzzle bowled,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_15:1.0000:And high in swathe of smoke the mast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_16:1.0000:Its fighting rag outrolled.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_23:0.9750:She prompts them to her fruits and flower-beds ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_24:0.9750:Their beauty with her choicest interthreads,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_25:1.0000:And makes her revel of their merry zest.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_26:0.9750:As in our East much were it in our West,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_27:1.0000:If men had risen to do the work of heads.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_28:1.0000:Her gabbling grey she eyes askant, nor treads
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_29:1.0000:The ways they walk ; by what they speak oppressed.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_30:0.9750:How wrought they in their zenith ? 'Tis not writ ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0226_32:0.9750:Have they but held hor l;\ws mvl nature dcnr,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_1:0.9750:They mouth no sentence of inverted wit.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_2:1.0000:More prizes she her beasts than this high breed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_3:1.0000:Wry in the shape she wastes her milk to rear.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_8:1.0000:CONSIDER the sea's listless chime :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_9:1.0000:Time's self it is, made audible,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_10:1.0000:The murmur of the earth's own shell.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_11:0.9500:Secret continuance sublime
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_12:1.0000:Is the sea's end : our sight may pass
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_13:1.0000:No furlong further. Since time was,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_14:1.0000:This sound hath told the lapse of time.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_15:1.0000:No quiet, which is death's, it hath
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_16:1.0000:The mournf ulness of ancient life,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_17:1.0000:Enduring always at dull strife.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_18:1.0000:As the world's heart of rest and wrath,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_19:1.0000:Its painful pulse is in the sands.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_20:1.0000:Last utterly, the whole sky stands,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_21:1.0000:Gray and not known, along its path.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_22:1.0000:Listen along beside the sea,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_23:1.0000:Listen along among the woods ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_24:1.0000:Those voices of twin solitudes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_25:0.9750:Shall have one sound alike to thee :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_26:1.0000:Hark where the murmurs of thronged men
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_27:1.0000:Surge and sink back and surge again.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_28:1.0000:Still the one voice of wave and tree.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_29:1.0000:Gather a shell from the strewn beach,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_30:1.0000:And listen at its lips : they sigh
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_31:0.9750:The same desire and mystery,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0227_32:0.9750:The echo of the whole sea's speech.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_1:0.9750:And all mankind is thus at heart
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_2:1.0000:Not anything but what thou art :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_14:1.0000:Thee from report divine, and heard thy name,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_15:1.0000:Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_16:0.9750:This glorious canopy of light and blue ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_17:1.0000:Yet 'neath a curtain of tr nslucent dew
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_18:1.0000:Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_19:1.0000:Hesperus wifch the host of heaven came,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_20:1.0000:And lo ! creation widened in man's view.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_21:1.0000:Who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_22:0.9750:Within thy rays, O Sun, or who could find,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_23:0.9500:Whilst fly and leaf and insect stood revealed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_24:0.9750:That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0228_25:0.9500:Why do we then shun death with anxious strife,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_2:0.9750:While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_3:1.0000:Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_5:0.9750:Vainly the fowler's eye
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_6:1.0000:Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_7:1.0000:As darkly limned on the crimson sky,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_8:0.9750:Thy figure floats along.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_9:0.9750:Seek'st thou the plashy brink
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_10:1.0000:Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_11:1.0000:Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_12:1.0000:On the chafed ocean side ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_13:1.0000:There is a power whose care -
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_14:1.0000:Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_15:1.0000:The desert and illimitable air,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_16:0.9750:Lone wandering, but not lost.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_17:1.0000:All day thy wings have fanned,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_18:1.0000:At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_19:1.0000:Yef stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_20:1.0000:Though the dark night is near.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_21:1.0000:And soon that toil shall end ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_22:1.0000:Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_23:1.0000:And scream among thy fellows ; reeds shall bend
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_24:1.0000:Soon o'er thy shelter'd nest.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_25:1.0000:Thou'rt gone ; the abyss of heaven
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_26:1.0000:Hath swallow'd up thy form ; yet on my heart
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_27:1.0000:Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_28:1.0000:And shall not soon depart.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_29:0.9500:He who, from zone to zone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_30:0.9500:Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0229_31:1.0000:In the long way that I must tread alone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_15:1.0000:I CANNA tell what has come ower me
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_16:1.0000:That I am sae eerie and wae ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_17:1.0000:An auld-warld tale comes before me,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_18:1.0000:It haunts me by nicht and by day.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_19:0.9750:From the cool lift the gloamin' draps dimmer,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_20:1.0000:And the Rhine slips saftly by ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_21:1.0000:The taps of the mountains shimmer
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_22:1.0000:I' the lowe o' the sunset sky.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_23:1.0000:Up there, in a glamour entrancing
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_24:1.0000:Sits a maiden wondrous fair ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_26:1.0000:She is kaimin' her gowden hair.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_27:0.9750:As she kaims it the gowd kaim glistens,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_28:0.9500:The while she is singiii' a song
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_29:0.9750:That bauds the rapt soul that listens,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_30:0.9750:With its melody sweet and strong.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_31:0.9500:The boy, floating by in vague wonder,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0230_32:0.9500:Is seized with a wild weird love ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_1:0.9750:He sees na the black rocks under,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_2:1.0000:He sees but the vision above.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_3:1.0000:The waters their waves are flingin'
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_4:1.0000:Ower boatie and boatman anon ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_5:1.0000:And this, with her airtful singin',
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_15:0.9750:OBSCUREST night involved the sky,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_17:0.9750:When such a destined wretch as 1,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_18:1.0000:Wash'd headlong from on board,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_19:1.0000:Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_20:1.0000:His floating home for ever left.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_21:0.9750:No braver chief could Albion boasfc
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_22:1.0000:Than he with whom he went,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_23:0.9750:Nor ever ship left Albion's coast
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_24:1.0000:With warmer wishes sent.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_25:1.0000:He loved them both, but both in vain ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_26:1.0000:Nor him beheld, nor her again.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_27:0.9750:Not long beneath the whelming brine
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_28:0.9500:Expert to swim, he lay ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_29:1.0000:Nor soon he felt his strength decline,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_30:1.0000:Or courage die away ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0231_31:1.0000:But waged with death a lasting strife,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_1:0.9750:He shouted ; nor his friends had fail'd
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_2:1.0000:To check the vessel's course,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_3:0.9750:But so the furious blast prevail'd,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_5:0.9750:They left their outcast mate behind,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_6:1.0000:And scudded still before the wind.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_7:1.0000:Some succour yet they could afford ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_8:1.0000:And, such as storms allow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_9:0.9500:The cask, the coop, the floated cord,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_10:1.0000:Delay'd not to bestow :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_11:1.0000:But he, they knew, nor ship nor shore,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_12:1.0000:Whate'er they gave, should visit more.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_13:1.0000:Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_14:1.0000:Their haste himself condemn,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_15:1.0000:Aware that flight, in such a sea,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_16:1.0000:Alone could rescue them ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_17:1.0000:Yet bitter felt it stiU to die
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_18:1.0000:Deserted, and his friends so nigh.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_19:1.0000:He long survives, who lives an hour
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_20:1.0000:In ocean, self -upheld :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_21:0.9750:And so long he, with unspent power,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_22:0.9500:His destiny repell'd ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_23:1.0000:And ever, as the minutes flew,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_24:0.9750:Entreated help, or cried " Adieu 1 "
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_25:1.0000:At length, his transient respite past,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_26:1.0000:His comrades, who before
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_27:0.9500:Had heard his voice in every blast,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_28:0.9750:Could catch the sound no more :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_29:1.0000:For then, by toil subdued, he drank
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_30:0.9750:The stifling wave, and then he sank.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_31:0.9750:No poet wept him ; but the page
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_33:0.9750:That tells his name, his worth, his age,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_34:0.9500:Is wet with Anson's tear :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_35:1.0000:And tears by bards or heroes shed
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0232_36:0.9750:Alike immortalise the dead.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0233_2:1.0000:Descanting on his fate,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0234_2:0.9500:MY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0234_27:0.9750:Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0234_29:1.0000:And leaden- eyed despairs ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0234_30:1.0000:Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous e^ os,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0235_5:1.0000:Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0235_6:1.0000:I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0235_7:1.0000:Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0235_20:1.0000:Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0235_21:1.0000:To cease upon the midnight with no pain,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_22:1.0000:And all the men and women merely players :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_23:1.0000:They have their exits and their entrances ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_24:1.0000:And one man in his time plays many parts,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_25:1.0000:His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_26:1.0000:Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_27:1.0000:And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_28:1.0000:And shining morning face, creeping like snail
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_29:1.0000:Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_30:1.0000:Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_31:1.0000:Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_32:1.0000:Full of strange oaths and bearded like a pard,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_33:1.0000:Jealous in humor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_34:1.0000:Seeking the bubble reputation
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_35:1.0000:Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_36:1.0000:In fair round belly with good capon lined,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_37:1.0000:With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0293_38:0.9500:Full of wise saws and modern instances ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_1:0.9750:And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_2:1.0000:To the lean and slippered pantaloon,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_3:1.0000:With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_4:1.0000:His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_5:1.0000:For his shrunk shank ; and his big manly voice,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_6:0.9750:Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_7:1.0000:And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0294_9:1.0000:In second childishness and mere oblivion,

selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_4:0.9500:9. Why does this detail give its name to the poem ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_32:1.0000:On a poet's lips I slept
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_34:0.9750:In the sound his breathing kept ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_35:1.0000:Nor seeks nor finds he mortal blisses,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_36:1.0000:But feeds on the aerial kisses
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0299_37:0.9500:Of shapes that haunt thought's wiMci nesses.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_1:0.9500:He will watch from dawn to gloom
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_2:0.9500:The lake-reflected sun illume
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_3:1.0000:The yellow bees in the ivy-bloom,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_4:1.0000:Nor heed nor see what things may be
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_5:1.0000:But from these create he can
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_6:1.0000:Forms more real than living man,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0300_17:0.9750:" This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_33:0.9750:Owre fast for thought, owre hot for rule,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0301_34:0.9500:Owre blate to seek, owre prood to snool,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_1:1.0000:Is there a Bard of rustic song,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_2:1.0000:Who, noteless, steals the crowds among
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_7:0.9500:Is there a man whose judgment clear,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_8:0.9500:. Can others teach the course to steer,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_9:0.9750:Yet runs, himself, life's mad career
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_11:0.9500:Here pause and, thro' the starting tear,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_14:1.0000:Was quick to learn, and wise to know,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_15:0.9750:And keenly felt the friendly glow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_19:0.9750:Reader, attend whether thy soul
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_20:1.0000:Soars fancy's flights beyond the pole,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_27:0.9750:" Perhaps some doctor, of tremendous paunch,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_28:1.0000:Awful and deep, a black abyss of drink,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_29:1.0000:Outlives them all ; and from his buried flock
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0302_30:1.0000:Retiring, full of rumination sad,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_4:0.9750:" The doublet's modest gray or brown,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_5:1.0000:The slender sword-hilt's plain device,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_6:1.0000:What sign had these for prince or clown ?
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0303_7:0.9750:Few turned, or none, to scan him twice."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_18:1.0000:When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_19:1.0000:I summon up remembrance of things past,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_20:1.0000:I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_21:1.0000:And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_22:1.0000:Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_23:1.0000:For precious friends hid in death's dateless night.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_24:1.0000:And weep afresh love's long-since-cancelled woe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_25:1.0000:And moan the expense of many a vanish'd si^ht :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_26:0.9750:Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_27:1.0000:And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_28:1.0000:The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_29:1.0000:Which I new pay as if not paid before.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_30:1.0000:But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_31:1.0000:All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_33:0.9750:Then hate me when thou wilt ; if ever, now ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_34:1.0000:Now while the world is bent niy deeds to cross,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_35:1.0000:Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_36:1.0000:And do not drop in for an after-loss :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_37:1.0000:Ah ! do not, when my heart hath scaped this sorrow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0304_38:1.0000:Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_1:1.0000:Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_2:0.9750:To linger out a purposed overthrow.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_3:1.0000:If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_4:1.0000:When other petty griefs have done their spite,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_5:1.0000:But in the onset come ; so shall I taste
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_6:1.0000:At first the very worst of fortune's might ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_7:1.0000:And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_8:0.9750:Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_12:0.9750:Lie scatter'd on the Alpine mountains cold ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_13:1.0000:Even them who kept Thy truth so pure of old,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_14:1.0000:When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and stones,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_15:0.9500:Forget not : in Thy book record their groans
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_16:1.0000:Who were Thy sheep, and in their ancient fold
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_17:1.0000:Slain by the bloody Piedmontese, that roll'd
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_18:1.0000:Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_19:1.0000:The vales redoubled to the hills, and they
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_20:1.0000:To heaven. Their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_21:1.0000:O'er all the Italian fields, where still doth sway,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_22:1.0000:The triple tyrant ; that from these may grow
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_23:1.0000:A hundred fold, who, having learn'd Thy way,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_24:0.9750:Early may fly the Babylonian woe.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_27:1.0000:WHEN I consider how my light is spent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_28:0.9750:Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_29:1.0000:And that one talent which is death to hide,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_30:1.0000:Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_31:0.9500:To serve therewith my Maker, and present
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_34:0.9500:I fondly ask : but Patience, to prevent
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_35:1.0000:That murmur, soon replies, ' ' God doth not need
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0305_36:0.9750:Either man's work, or His own gifts ; who best
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_1:0.9500:Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best ; His state
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_2:1.0000:Is kingly : thousands at His bidding speed,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_3:1.0000:And post o'er land and ocean without rest ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_4:0.9750:They also serve who only stand and wait."
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_6:1.0000:SHE fluted with her mouth as when one sips,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_7:1.0000:And gently waved her golden head, inclin'd
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_8:1.0000:Outside his cage close to the window-blind :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_9:1.0000:Till her fond bird, with little turns and dips,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_10:0.9500:Piped low to her of sweet companionships.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_11:1.0000:And when he made an end, some seed took she
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_12:1.0000:And fed him from her tongue, which rosily
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_13:1.0000:Peeped as a piercing bud between her lips.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_14:1.0000:And like the child in Chaucer, on whose tongue
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_15:1.0000:The Blessed Mary laid, when he was dead,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_16:1.0000:A grain, who straightway praised her name in song :
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_17:1.0000:Even so, when she, a little lightly red,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_18:1.0000:Now turned on me and laughed, I heard the throng
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_19:1.0000:Of inner voices praise her golden head.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_21:1.0000:OTHERS abide our question. Thou art free.
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_22:1.0000:We ask and ask. Thou smilest, and art still,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_23:1.0000:Out-topping knowledge. For the loftiest hill,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_24:1.0000:Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_25:0.9750:Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_26:1.0000:Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_27:0.9500:Spares but the cloudy border of his base
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_28:0.9750:To the foiled searching of mortality ;
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_30:0.9500:Self -schooled, self-scanned, self-honored, self-secure,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_32:0.9750:All pains the immortal spirit must endure,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_33:1.0000:All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,
selectpoemsedite00worduoft_0306_34:1.0000:Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_20:0.9750:For though I know he loves me
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_21:1.0000:Tonight my heart is sad
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_22:1.0000:His kiss was not so wonderful
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0009_23:0.9500:As all the dreams I had.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_8:0.9500:What do I owe to you
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_9:1.0000:Who loved me deep and long?
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_10:1.0000:You never gave my spirit wings
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_11:1.0000:Or gave my heart a song.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_12:1.0000:But, oh, to him I loved
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_13:1.0000:Who loved me not at all,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0010_14:0.9750:I owe the open gate
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_18:0.9500:Let it be forgotten for ever and ever,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_19:1.0000:Time is a kind friend, he will make us old.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_20:1.0000:If anyone asks, say it was forgotten
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_21:1.0000:Long and long ago,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_22:1.0000:As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0011_23:1.0000:In a long forgotten snow.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_11:0.9500:Arcturus, bringer of spring,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_12:1.0000:Lord of the summer nights, leaving us now in autumn,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_16:0.9500:I felt it in my blood,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_19:0.9750:There in the thickening dark a wind-bent tree above me
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_20:1.0000:Loosed its last leaves in flight
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0017_21:1.0000:I saw you sink and vanish, pitiless Arcturus,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_16:1.0000:I went out on an April morning
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_17:1.0000:All alone, for my heart was high,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_18:1.0000:I was a child of the shining meadow,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_19:0.9750:I was a sister of the sky.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_20:1.0000:There in the windy flood of morning,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_21:1.0000:Longing lifted its weight from me,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_22:1.0000:Lost as a sob in the midst of cheering,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_30:1.0000:From the cup of the crescent moon,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_31:0.9750:And hungrily as men eat bread,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0018_32:1.0000:Loved the scented nights of June.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_1:1.0000:Some shining strange escape for me
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0019_2:1.0000:Who sought in Beauty the bright wine
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_12:1.0000:When I am dead and over me bright April
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_13:1.0000:Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_14:1.0000:Though you should lean above me broken-hearted
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_15:1.0000:I shall not care.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_16:1.0000:I shall have peace as leafy trees are peaceful
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_17:1.0000:When rain bends down the bough,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_18:1.0000:And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_19:0.9500:Than you are now.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0020_20:0.9750:Could any mood be truer to youth than that?
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_8:0.9750:There will be stars over the place forever;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_9:0.9750:Though the house we loved and the street we loved
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_10:0.9500:are lost,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_11:0.9500:Every time the earth circles her orbit,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_12:1.0000:On the night the autumn equinox is crossed,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_13:0.9750:Two stars we knew, poised on the peak of midnight,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_14:0.9750:Will reach their zenith; stillness will be deep;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_15:1.0000:There will be stars over the place forever,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0021_16:0.9500:There will be stars forever, while we sleep.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_18:1.0000:I could not love thee, dear, so much
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_19:1.0000:Loved I not honour more;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0022_21:1.0000:I would I were where Helen lies,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_4:0.9500:In a wood too deep for a single star to look through,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_5:0.9500:You led down a path whose turnings you knew in the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_7:1.0000:But the scent of the dew-dripping cedars was all
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_8:0.9500:that I knew.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_9:1.0000:I drank of the darkness, I was fed with the honey of
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_10:0.9750:fragrance,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_11:1.0000:I was glad of my life, the drawing of breath was
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_12:0.9750:sweet ;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_13:1.0000:I heard your voice, you said, "Look down, see the
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_14:0.9500:glow-worm!"
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0023_16:0.9500:We watched while it brightened as though it were
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0024_8:0.9750:are excerpts from reviews
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_21:1.0000:You laugh in happy thunder all alone,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_22:1.0000:You fold upon yourself, you dance your dance
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_23:1.0000:Impartially on drift-weed, sand or stone.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_24:0.9750:You make us believe that we can outlive death,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_25:0.9750:You make us for an instant, for your sake,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_26:1.0000:Burn, like stretched silver of a wave,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0025_27:0.9500:Not breaking, but about to break.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_6:0.9500:Not by the sea, but somewhere in the hills,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_7:1.0000:Not by the sea, but in the uplands surely
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_8:1.0000:There must be rest where a dim pool demurely
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_9:0.9500:Watches all night the stern slow-moving skies.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_23:0.9750:It is enough of honor for one lifetime
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_24:1.0000:To have known you better than the rest have
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_25:1.0000:known,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_26:1.0000:The shadows and the colors of your voice,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_27:1.0000:Your will, immutable and still as stone.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_28:0.9750:The shy heart, so lonely and so gay,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_29:0.9750:The sad laughter and the pride of pride,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_30:1.0000:The tenderness, the depth of tenderness
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0026_31:0.9500:Rich as the earth, and wide as heaven is wide.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_8:1.0000:I have less need now than when I was young
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_9:1.0000:To share myself with every comer,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_10:0.9750:Or shape my thoughts into words with my
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_11:0.9750:tongue.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_12:1.0000:It is one to me that they come or go
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_13:1.0000:If I have myself and the drive of my will,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_14:1.0000:And strength to climb on a summer night
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_15:1.0000:And watch the stars swarm over the hill.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_16:1.0000:Let them think I love them more than I do,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_17:1.0000:Let them think I care, though I go alone,
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_18:1.0000:If it lifts their pride what is it to me
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0027_19:1.0000:Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_5:1.0000:It is disciplined, controlled a prelude to a tumult
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_6:0.9500:The stretched silver of a wave
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_18:1.0000:I know a certain tune that my life plays;
sarateasdalebyje00rittuoft_0034_19:1.0000:Over and over I have heard it start

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_16:0.9750:And the outward betrays all their inward distress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_20:0.9500:While the world has its way, she holds permanant bliss
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_22:0.9500:Let the capricious spirit ne'er enter my breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_23:1.0000:Let pride and presumption depart :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_24:1.0000:For they all to mankind are the demonic pest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0017_25:0.9500:When harbour' d at all in the heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_1:0.9750:In a cave, or a tub, or a sweet little cot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_2:1.0000:Wherever my home may appear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_3:0.9750:Let peace and contentment encircle the lot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_4:1.0000:My heart and my spirit to cheer.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_5:1.0000:Fair serenity then, with a smile on her face,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_7:1.0000:All the tumults of life, with the enemy chase,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_8:0.9500:And bury them under the ground.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_9:0.9750:Now begone from my presence, sad doubt and despair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_11:0.9750:As I don't harbour sorrow, grief, trouble, or care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_15:0.9750:For your business is nought but destruction and war ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_17:1.0000:Then begone to your cell, and leave me in my cot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_19:0.9750:Tho' I've little, I've plenty, content is my lot ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_20:0.9750:With a heart that is happy and free !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_21:1.0000:Lovely peace, joy, and harmony, ever abide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_22:1.0000:In the mansion, cottage, or cell :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_23:0.9750:With the spirit of God, our director and guide ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_24:0.9750:We never can fail to do well. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_25:1.0000:Mark ! the Christian alone, has the power within,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_27:1.0000:To outride all the storms, and the conquest to win
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_28:0.9750:Now raging by land or by sea.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_29:0.9750:Then the casket he quits for a mansion above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0018_31:0.9500:Free, and all to enjoy, at the fountain of love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_10:1.0000:From sin, reproach, and shame.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_11:1.0000:Could I behold him passing by,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_12:1.0000:My heart would dance with glee !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_13:1.0000:I'd envy nobody ; no, not I :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_14:0.9750:Tho' some might envy me.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_15:1.0000:As I'd enjoy his lovely smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_16:1.0000:So placid and serene !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_17:1.0000:Free from hypocrisy and guile ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_18:1.0000:My heart would then be clean.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_19:0.9750:And I with generous sentiment,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_20:1.0000:Would raise my voice and cry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_21:1.0000:He gave me peace, and true content,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_22:1.0000:As he was passing by.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_23:0.9500:I caught his smile and felt his power,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0019_24:0.9500:On that delightful day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_2:1.0000:When I beheld the lovely flower,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_3:1.0000:Which never shall decay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_4:1.0000:The rose of Sharon, ever fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_5:1.0000:And all the lilies thrive,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_6:1.0000:In vital, and salubrious air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_7:1.0000:Which keeps the soul alive.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_8:0.9750:My Lord is in the midst, and lo !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_9:1.0000:The sun shines on the whole ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_10:0.9750:While heavenly breezes gently blow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_12:1.0000:" Come unto me who fain would live,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_14:1.0000:" And life eternal I will give !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_15:1.0000:" Come sinner, come to me."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_16:1.0000:My voice, in anthems now I raise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_17:1.0000:And sing right merrily ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_18:0.9750:Through grace, I'll spend my golden days
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_19:1.0000:With him who set me free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_20:0.9750:And then, when lifted up on high,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_21:1.0000:The King in glory see !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_22:1.0000:I'll swell the concave of the sky,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_23:0.9750:To all eternity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_24:1.0000:'Mid angels and archangels blend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_25:1.0000:Those melodies divine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_26:0.9750:With Jesus Christ, the sinners friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_27:1.0000:In whose bright image shine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_28:0.9750:And this the burden of my song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_29:0.9750:For evermore shall be ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0020_30:0.9750:All praise and power to him belong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_4:0.9500:And said with promptness, " Here I am ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_5:1.0000:The faith of whom was try'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_6:1.0000:Thus, said Jehovah, " Take thy son,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_7:0.9750:Thine only son indeed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_8:0.9750:A mighty work must be begun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_9:1.0000:And finish' d in thy seed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_10:1.0000:For all the Nations of the earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_11:1.0000:Shall blessed be in thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_12:1.0000:Tho' some may travel long in birth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_13:1.0000:Through Christ, the whole are free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_16:1.0000:Thou'lt offer up at my command,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_17:0.9500:Thine only son and heir.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_20:1.0000:A sacrifice, the great I am !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_21:1.0000:Requires the world to save."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_22:0.9750:Then, in the morning Abram rose
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_24:1.0000:Not to investigate, the cause
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_25:0.9750:By faith alone must stand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_26:1.0000:His ass he saddl'd, and with him,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0021_27:0.9500:Now took his only son ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_1:1.0000:And clave the wood to put in trim
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_2:0.9750:The sacrifice begun.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_3:1.0000:Here recognize, by faith 'tis made
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_4:1.0000:To represent the true ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_5:1.0000:Which Abram saw within the shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_6:1.0000:Fixt by the golden screw ! [Christ]
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_7:1.0000:When lifting up his eyes he saw,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_8:1.0000:The place a great way off;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_9:1.0000:Whose son with him did forward go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_10:1.0000:Altho' the path was rough.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_11:1.0000:Nor did his Isaac know for why,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_12:1.0000:The wood alone he bore ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_13:1.0000:But here's the test by which to try
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_14:1.0000:His confidence the more.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_15:1.0000:He took the fire, likewise the knife,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_16:1.0000:And both together went ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_17:0.9750:Abram to take his Isaac's life,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_18:1.0000:For this was his intent.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_19:1.0000:They reach' d the summit of the hill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_20:1.0000:On which an altar made ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_21:1.0000:And Isaac must go through the drill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_22:0.9500:Close by the quivering blade.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_23:1.0000:" Father," said he, with courage bold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_25:1.0000:" All's ready, fire and wood behold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_26:1.0000:But where's the lamb to die ?"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_27:0.9750:Then said Abraham to his son ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_30:1.0000:God will the lamb provide."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0022_31:1.0000:The father bound his son at last,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_1:1.0000:This sacrifice of noble cast ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_2:1.0000:But, ah ! was he afraid ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_3:1.0000:His hand he now stretch'd forth, and took
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_4:0.9750:The knife to slay his son ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_5:1.0000:And then Jehovah seal'd the book,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_6:0.9750:For lo ! the work is done.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_7:0.9750:An angel call'd from heaven, and said
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_10:0.9750:Hold ! faith the work confirms."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_11:0.9750:By this, I know thou fearest God ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_12:1.0000:Nor hath withheld thy son,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_13:0.9750:Thine only son, from penal rod,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_14:1.0000:The vict'ry thou haafc won.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_15:1.0000:Then, Abram, lifting up his eyes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_16:1.0000:Found what he never sought ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_17:1.0000:A ram, (unto his great surprise)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_18:0.9750:Was in the thicket caught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_19:1.0000:He took the same, and offer' d him.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_20:0.9500:For a burnt sacrifice ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_21:1.0000:Instead of that most precious gem
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_22:1.0000:By whom the nations rise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_23:1.0000:Thus, in the mountain of the Lord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_24:1.0000:Where sacrifice hath been
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_25:1.0000:By Christ prepar'd, our life's restor'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0023_26:0.9500:Behold, behold, the scene ! ! !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_6:0.9750:But let it here its fragrance shed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_7:1.0000:Then wither, and decay —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_8:1.0000:As did the mould from whence it rose
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_9:1.0000:So lovely and so fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_10:1.0000:Tho' now it rests in sweet repose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_11:1.0000:Devoid of thought and care.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_12:1.0000:This relic of the last remains
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_13:1.0000:Of whom we once did love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_14:1.0000:Is what the living now obtains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_15:1.0000:As olive from the dove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_16:1.0000:Look on those beauteous flowers and say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_17:1.0000:Their author cares for such ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_18:1.0000:And shall he not this sleeping clay
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_19:1.0000:Revive ? with honor'd touch.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_20:1.0000:Mar not the bud that blossoms here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_21:1.0000:Where rests my bosom friend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_22:1.0000:For shortly I must join the bier,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_23:1.0000:With kindred ashes blend —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_24:0.9750:And in the morn, the splendid morn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_25:1.0000:Of that appointed day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_26:1.0000:When death will of his strength be shorn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0024_27:1.0000:Shall rise and tower away.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_2:1.0000:Where Sharon's lovely flower ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_3:1.0000:For ever, and for ever springs
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_9:0.9500:Whose body lies below —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_10:1.0000:A bed of flowers so sweet and fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_11:1.0000:I'll plant where I can oft repair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_12:1.0000:To see the roses grow —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_13:1.0000:And drop the sympathising tear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_14:0.9750:On ashes now devoid of fear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_15:1.0000:Alike to grief and pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_16:1.0000:And yet, in hope here rests the earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_18:1.0000:Then shall it spring again —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_19:1.0000:The rose reminds me of the day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_20:1.0000:When those shall rise in grand display,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_21:1.0000:Who love their Saviour here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_23:1.0000:When Jesus call'd his spirit home,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_24:1.0000:And shed the parting tear —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_25:1.0000:Behold his resurrective power,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_26:1.0000:And feel the fragrance of the flower,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0025_27:0.9500:In silence stand amaz'd;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_3:1.0000:To life the dead was raised —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_4:1.0000:From this a noble lesson learn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_5:1.0000:Nor ever dare to grieve and mourn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_6:1.0000:For those who sleep in peace —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_7:1.0000:Secure they rest in his embrace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_8:1.0000:Whose footsteps we must ever trace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_9:1.0000:Till time with us shall cease. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_10:1.0000:Then shall I as a laurel bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_11:0.9500:Shine forth in splendor and delight ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_12:1.0000:To grace the honor' d brow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_13:1.0000:Of him who hath the keys of death ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_14:1.0000:And prov'd the same while here on earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_15:1.0000:To whom all nations bow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_16:1.0000:Tho' lilies in the valley grow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_17:1.0000:And spread their fume through all below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_18:1.0000:The essence of true love —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_19:1.0000:The rose of Sharon blossoms there,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_20:0.9750:Amid the sweet salubrious air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_21:0.9500:Of Paradise above —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_22:1.0000:So may I be, when Christ appears,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_23:1.0000:And all my days, and months, and years,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_24:0.9500:With time are pass'd away;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_25:1.0000:There, all the plants are ever green,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_26:1.0000:And fruit in rich abundance seen,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_27:1.0000:Throughout eternal day ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_28:0.9750:Ah ! for that blessed treat when I
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_29:1.0000:Shall bask in realms beyond the sky,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_30:0.9750:Where beams my Saviour's face ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_31:1.0000:And there partake of all the store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_32:1.0000:To saints reserv'd for evermore,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0026_33:0.9750:Matured by his grace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_5:0.9750:Would hold in fetters or in bond,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_6:1.0000:All subjects and their kings.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_7:1.0000:If stationary man must be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_8:1.0000:In arts and science brave ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_9:1.0000:Grand genius, never could be free
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_10:1.0000:From trammels of the slave.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_11:1.0000:The mind would be a cumb'rous mass,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_12:1.0000:In het'rogeneous form ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_13:1.0000:Nor could our nature ever pass
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_14:1.0000:The bound' ries of the worm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_15:1.0000:Thus, crawling on, amid the whole
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_16:0.9750:Of splendour in creation ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_17:1.0000:To settle where we got the fall,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_18:1.0000:Nor rise to higher station.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_19:1.0000:A meagre, low, degraded set
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_20:1.0000:Of mortals born to die ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_21:1.0000:For ever and for ever bet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_22:1.0000:To rise need never try.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_23:1.0000:But is it so with man ? the prime
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_24:1.0000:And master piece of God ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_25:0.9750:Are all his mental powers sublime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_26:1.0000:To sink beneath the sod ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0027_27:1.0000:In whose bright image was he made r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_1:1.0000:Altho' he may be in the shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_2:1.0000:He's got the vital spark !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_3:0.9750:Reflecting light upon the whole
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_4:1.0000:Of God's creative plan ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_5:0.9500:Likewise redemption from the fall :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_6:1.0000:Behold his love to man ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_7:1.0000:Our ruin couldn't be design'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_8:1.0000:By him who built us first ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_9:1.0000:With capability of mind
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_10:1.0000:Beyond th' angelic host !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_11:1.0000:How far surpassing which, I can't
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_12:1.0000:In truth presume to say ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_13:1.0000:The rising progress of the saint,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_14:1.0000:Runs to eternal day ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_15:1.0000:Let this suffice, and move along,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_16:1.0000:With pleasure and delight ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_17:1.0000:Until you join yon happy throng,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_18:1.0000:Where faith is lost in sight.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_19:1.0000:In pro, and retrospective glance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_20:1.0000:We view a world of mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_21:1.0000:Which ever, ever must advance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_22:1.0000:New projects still to find.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_23:1.0000:But ah ! th' reflecting part of man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_24:1.0000:Will testify the fact ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_25:1.0000:That God in wisdom form'd the plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_26:0.9750:And gave him power to act.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_27:0.9500:By which, the image of his God,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_28:0.9750:He must assimilate ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_29:0.9500:Or feel the burden of his rod ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_30:0.9500:Or rise to high estate !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_31:0.9750:With strength of intellectual mind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0028_32:0.9500:The standard and the tower
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_2:1.0000:He never need to lower :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_3:1.0000:But move eternal with the word,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_4:1.0000:That spake a world from naught ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_5:1.0000:"Which darksome chaos bounding heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_6:1.0000:And in an instant caught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_7:1.0000:The march of intellect is such,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_8:1.0000:Progressing every day;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_9:1.0000:Nor e'er can reach the highest touch,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_10:0.9750:Or catch the brightest ray.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_11:0.9750:Splendoric beauties day and night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_12:1.0000:Are opening in the field,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_13:1.0000:Where mind can soar beyond our sight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_14:0.9500:To myst'ries unreveal'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_15:1.0000:Tho' here the sun in splendour shines,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_16:1.0000:And gems are glit'ring bright ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_17:1.0000:Thus, opening out the golden mines,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_18:0.9750:Of wisdom, truth, and light.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_19:1.0000:Wherein we daily may progress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_20:1.0000:So boundless is the store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_21:1.0000:Which never, never can grow less,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_22:1.0000:But increase more and more.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_23:1.0000:Can we who occupy the mind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_24:0.9750:Or boon which God hath given ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_25:1.0000:Else but advance nor lay behind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_26:1.0000:Or stop this side of heaven ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_27:0.9750:According to the mind's improve,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_29:0.9750:For the enjoyment high above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_30:0.9750:To all eternity ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0029_31:0.9750:Mark well, th' acquirements of the age,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_2:1.0000:Which can't run through the sieve.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_3:0.9750:The ingenuity of art,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_4:0.9500:And science, wond'rous great ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_5:1.0000:With mind alone, the project start,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_6:1.0000:And raise its own estate ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_7:1.0000:Witness the progress it has made,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_8:1.0000:Within last forty years ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_9:1.0000:In educational parade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_10:1.0000:Which now so free appears.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_11:1.0000:Those cannot wonder who are taught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_12:1.0000:The lessons of the wise ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_13:1.0000:When more extended is the thought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_14:1.0000:To reach heyond the skies.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_15:1.0000:Some minds will creep, and lay the plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_16:0.9750:For others to fulfil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_17:1.0000:Who have the wealth, but not the man
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_18:1.0000:With genius, art, or skill.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_19:1.0000:As stars of different magnitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_20:1.0000:In th' moral hemisphere ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_21:1.0000:We shine in various altitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_22:1.0000:And thus on earth appear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_23:0.9750:The head, the hand, the will, the heart,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_24:1.0000:Must each their office bear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_25:1.0000:As nature's laws, give all a start,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_26:0.9750:And genius drives the car.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_27:1.0000:Then let us each our station fill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_28:0.9750:In one harmonic whole ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_29:1.0000:And not a wheel be standing still,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0030_30:0.9750:In this majestic ball.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_2:0.9750:Which often does abscond.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_3:1.0000:With this idea some will rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_4:1.0000:Indulging sense alone ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_5:1.0000:Thinking that man is but a jest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_6:0.9750:Or mimic — alien born.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_7:1.0000:Tho' when he's gone his utmost stretch,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_8:1.0000:Drops short of his desire ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_9:1.0000:Nor can retrieve or ever catch,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_10:1.0000:What nature doth require. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_11:1.0000:But think ye not who're moving low,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_12:1.0000:That you can't tower away ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_13:1.0000:Mark ! trying is the eagle's claw,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_14:1.0000:To catch and hold the prey.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_15:1.0000:Thus on the wing, you mount beyond
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_16:0.9750:The rest, and leave behind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_17:1.0000:Yon dying embers, never found,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_18:1.0000:Are scatter' d with the wind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_19:0.9750:Then let us strive, to rise and shine
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_20:1.0000:Above the meagre class ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_21:1.0000:Who think all human, none divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_22:0.9750:Nor have a right to pass.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_23:0.9750:Immeability in this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_24:0.9750:Can not at all apply ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_25:1.0000:Unless the soul of man should miss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0031_26:0.9750:Its rest beyond the sky,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_8:1.0000:Tlio' simple is the moral tale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_9:0.9750:Time can't the fact erase.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_10:1.0000:"While unity is strength you know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_11:1.0000:And thus exemplifi'd ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_12:1.0000:By which to chase away the foe,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_13:1.0000:But caught if you divide.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_14:0.9500:One mom in spring, so charming sweet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_15:0.9750:While passing on my way :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_16:1.0000:I much enjoy'd a lovely treat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_17:1.0000:When nature's suit was gay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_18:1.0000:And Philomela's voice was heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_19:1.0000:With all her train attendants ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_20:0.9750:In unity with one accord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_21:1.0000:To gain their independence.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_22:1.0000:Harmonic strains salute my ear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_23:0.9500:In lovely melody ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0032_25:0.9750:Both ebbing to the sea.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_1:0.9750:Whence all the streams that ever rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_2:0.9750:To inundate the vale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_3:1.0000:Proceed, and form the general cause,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_4:1.0000:Of turged hill and dale.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_6:0.9750:In this locality ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_7:1.0000:And echo through the whole resounds,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_8:1.0000:A band in unity !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_9:1.0000:The jasmine, lily, and the rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_10:1.0000:"With flowers of vari'd hue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_11:0.9750:Do now their balmy sweets disclose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_12:0.9750:My senses to renew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_13:0.9750:Ths sun shone beautiful and fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_14:1.0000:On all the landscape round ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_15:1.0000:And I amid salubrious air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_16:0.9750:Seem'd on enchanted ground.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_17:1.0000:When lo ! a solemn silence broke
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_18:1.0000:The sweet harmonic string ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_19:1.0000:And thus advanc'd an old glead hawk,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_20:0.9750:Flapping his murky wing.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_21:0.9750:Bold and heroic as he came,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_22:0.9750:To seize upon his prey ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_23:1.0000:But others had to play the game,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_24:1.0000:And he'd to scud away ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_25:1.0000:The peaceful feather'd tribe engage
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_27:1.0000:A conference here, and war to wage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_28:1.0000:With him the emperor bold.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_29:0.9750:All arm'd with bills in their defence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_30:0.9750:Have at him tooth and nail ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_31:0.9750:And drove the rebel scouting hence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0033_32:1.0000:With only half his tail.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_1:1.0000:The birds in triumph rais'd their voice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_2:1.0000:With language rough and rife ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_3:1.0000:Flew after him, who had no choice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_4:0.9750:But to escape for life.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_5:1.0000:In much alarm, the bounding peal
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_6:1.0000:Did through the valley ring ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_7:1.0000:Which made the hawk, with horror squeal?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_8:1.0000:And wend his nervous wing ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_9:1.0000:To some far distant rock or cave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_10:1.0000:Where he might shelter get ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_11:1.0000:As by the host in union brave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_12:1.0000:He now was fairly bet.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_13:1.0000:The victors all in hearty glee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_14:1.0000:Resum'd their wonted song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_15:1.0000:As they had won the victory
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_16:1.0000:By union, bill, and tongue.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_17:1.0000:The enemy is chas'd away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_18:1.0000:No blood shed in the war,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_19:1.0000:Nor mooty needless debt to pay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_24:1.0000:As lights within the dreary shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_25:0.9750:Where Chaos reign'd before :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0034_26:1.0000:New life sprang up in grand display,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_2:1.0000:With men of splendid mind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_3:1.0000:Tho' some with morbid passions, whine
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_4:0.9500:In visionary light ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_5:1.0000:Yet, myriads more in lustre shine
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_6:0.9750:Magnificently bright !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_7:1.0000:Tho' on this small globular spot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_8:1.0000:Existence man shall find ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_9:1.0000:Relate to me where he is not,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_10:1.0000:With other worlds combin'd ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_12:1.0000:Beyond all mortal ken ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_13:1.0000:And tho' the union may subside,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_15:1.0000:A vista peep we have within,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_16:0.9750:Where all is on the move ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_17:1.0000:And ever since time did begin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_18:1.0000:Are join'd to things above.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_19:1.0000:Witness the thought that flies apace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_20:1.0000:Where matter can't be seen ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_21:1.0000:Nor has it ever found a place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_22:1.0000:In permanence to reign.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_23:1.0000:While cas'd in elements of clay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_24:0.9750:'Tis ranging far and wide ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_25:0.9750:Nor either, for one moment stay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_26:0.9750:Alike to wind and tide.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_27:1.0000:Progressing in the common shift,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_28:1.0000:Alone attach' d to time ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_29:1.0000:Where mind is ofttimes run adrift,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_30:0.9750:For want of things sublime ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0035_31:0.9750:Until at length she takes her flight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_1:0.9750:One thing is sure, all must be right
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_2:1.0000:With those who're living well.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_3:1.0000:Here, while the gem is in the case,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_4:1.0000:Alike subject to fall ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_5:1.0000:My confidence in thee I'll place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_6:1.0000:For thou art all in all !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_7:1.0000:A myst'ry to himself is man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_8:1.0000:And ever shall remain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_9:1.0000:Till thou, in wisdom shew the plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_10:1.0000:By which we truth obtain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_11:1.0000:And as thou art, then shall we be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_12:1.0000:In thy unique estate !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_13:0.9750:Thrice blest to all eternity,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_14:0.9750:Where life can ne'er abate.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_18:1.0000:God's goodness, makes our troubles less,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_19:0.9750:Likewise the many, none.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_20:1.0000:As we do magnify the moat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_21:1.0000:Into a mountain size ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_22:0.9750:And troubles make of what are naught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_23:1.0000:By sight of double eyes.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_24:1.0000:The eye when single, rightly plac'd
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_25:0.9750:On objects far or near,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0036_26:1.0000:Will never suffer time to waste,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_1:1.0000:But look direct unto the point,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_2:1.0000:Whence every blessing springs ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_3:1.0000:And fasten on a treble joint,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_4:1.0000:To soar on eagles wings !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_5:1.0000:Far, far beyond the murky, vain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_6:0.9750:And fancy burden' d whim ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_7:1.0000:Which loses more than it would gain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_8:0.9750:When eye is out of trim.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_9:1.0000:Those live by faith and not by sight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_10:1.0000:Who have the single eye ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_11:1.0000:Which brings gross darkness into light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_12:0.9500:And never looks awry.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_13:1.0000:Now, you perceive the object where,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_14:1.0000:By faith alone to stand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_15:1.0000:Above the tumults and the care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_16:0.9750:Which always are at hand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_18:1.0000:And he will thee sustain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_19:1.0000:Until thou reap the grand reward,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_23:0.9750:peospect beautiful and fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_24:1.0000:Presents itself to view ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_25:1.0000:The fruit of much long toil and care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0037_26:1.0000:We're reaping where it grew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_1:1.0000:The harvest fields are clad with corn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_2:1.0000:Embellishing the land ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_3:1.0000:The peasant rises in the morn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_4:0.9500:To cut it at command.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_5:1.0000:And then his master looks around,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_6:1.0000:Watching the time to reap,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_7:1.0000:While his ripe crops are on the ground,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_8:1.0000:Has little time to sleep.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_9:0.9750:Tho' feeble nature fain would rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_10:1.0000:Herself in sweet repose ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_11:1.0000:He knows that he must do his best,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_12:1.0000:His eyelids seldom close :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_13:1.0000:Whose mind is fill'd with anxious care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_14:1.0000:And watches every breeze ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_15:1.0000:Nor can one single moment spare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_16:1.0000:His fancy now to please.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_17:1.0000:The sun sets in the western skies,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_18:0.9750:The moon is shining bright ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_19:1.0000:And John is call'd on by surprise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_20:1.0000:To work the live long night.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_21:0.9750:The golden grain is cut and dry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_22:0.9750:• Ready to gather in ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_23:1.0000:Now lads, all hands to work and try
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_24:1.0000:The harvest thus to win. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_25:1.0000:For lo ! the clouds pretending rain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_26:1.0000:In quick succession rise ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_27:1.0000:And ere the sun has set again,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_28:1.0000:Are spread around the skies.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_29:0.9750:Harsh winds are murmuring in the vale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_30:0.9500:While vivid lightnings dart ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_31:0.9750:Loud peals of thunder turn me pale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0038_32:0.9750:And rend my very heart !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_1:0.9750:For I'm afraid yon lovely crop,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_2:1.0000:Will perish in the field ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_4:1.0000:And let them now be seal'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_5:1.0000:Ah no ! the time is gone, wherein
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_6:1.0000:You might have got the whole
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_7:1.0000:Made quite secure, nor ere begin
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_8:0.9750:Too late, on me to call.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_9:1.0000:Don't lay the blame on time and chance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_10:0.9500:Or tax kind providence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_11:1.0000:While you have seasons to enhance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_12:0.9500:The good he doth dispense.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_13:0.9750:Allow me one short respite more,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_14:0.9500:To gather in my grain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_15:1.0000:Tho' I have loiter' d much before,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_16:0.9750:I'll not do so again.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_17:1.0000:A time to sow, a time to reap,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_18:0.9750:A time to gather in !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_19:1.0000:But if in harvest time you sleep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_20:1.0000:You can't your harvest win.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_21:1.0000:Hark ye ! harsh winds begin to blow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_22:1.0000:Loud peals of thunder roar ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_23:1.0000:The rains descend on all below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_24:1.0000:And harvest time is o'er.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_25:1.0000:Now you have time to think of what
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_26:1.0000:You should have thought before ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_27:1.0000:When you were in your parlour sat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_28:0.9750:Instead of being at door.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_29:1.0000:Your crops are lost, and you must bear
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_31:1.0000:For want of diligence and care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0039_32:0.9500:All things have gone amiss.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_1:1.0000:A time to live, a time to die,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_2:1.0000:A time to watch and pray ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_3:1.0000:There is for all, tho' some may cry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_4:0.9750:When time has fled away.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_6:0.9500:The harvest is past, and the summer is ended,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_7:1.0000:The product of which must remain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_8:1.0000:To the day wherein wrongs can never be mended,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_9:1.0000:Yet each shall their merit obtain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_12:0.9500:And lives in a Cot of his own r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_13:1.0000:Has naught to bewilder his mind in a throng,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_14:1.0000:Where rancour and discord are sown.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_15:1.0000:Contented he sits by his own fireside,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_16:1.0000:And nothing his peace can annoy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_17:0.9500:Whose bliss is increas'd by an excellent bride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_18:0.9500:Co-partner with him in his joy.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_19:1.0000:Having books to peruse, and pencil to write,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_21:0.9750:On which he can pore with the greatest delight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0040_22:1.0000:Beyond what the opulent find.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_1:0.9750:In the bustle and din of a world full of noise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_2:0.9500:Distracting the peaceable soul ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_3:1.0000:Nor can he partake of their petulant joys,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_4:0.9500:However splendoric they roll.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_5:1.0000:Quite aloof from the whole, with time to reflect,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_6:0.9750:On mishaps and errors of life ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_7:0.9500:Through the which he has pass'd, and now can detect,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_8:0.9500:The turgid forebodings of strife.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_9:0.9750:With grace to o'ercome all the risings of sin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_10:1.0000:Attacking his soul in the vale ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_11:1.0000:He conquers the enemy ever within,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_12:1.0000:And rides on the wings of the gale !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_13:1.0000:I repeat it again, how happy the man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_14:1.0000:Who never, no never does wrong ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_15:1.0000:On principle founded, he works out the plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_16:0.9750:Which cannot to rancour belong.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_17:0.9750:Behold the fair cot, by the side of the hill !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_18:0.9500:Wherein, is the man of content ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_19:1.0000:Whose only anxiety is to fulfil
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_21:1.0000:Throughout a long life he has strove for the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_23:1.0000:Where conscience approves, no matter who blame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_24:0.9750:A blessing is to it annex' t. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_25:1.0000:The life that now is, and the life that's to come,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0041_26:0.9750:Are promis'd to those who obey;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_1:0.9500:The will of the Lord, who has fit up a home ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_2:0.9750:A house that will never decay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_3:0.9750:To which he resorts when he gives up the Ghost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_4:1.0000:That moulders his Cottage to dust ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_5:1.0000:Whose soul will then join with the heavenly host,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_7:1.0000:Made perfect below, — in a casket of clay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_8:1.0000:And fitted for mansions above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_9:1.0000:So noble and elegant in the display,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_14:0.9500:To lessen troubles, doubts, and fears,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_16:0.9750:Likewise the atmospheric sound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_17:1.0000:With marks of liquid fire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_18:0.9750:Which oft the guilty conscience wound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_19:0.9750:By God's vindictive ire ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_20:1.0000:While vengeance in tremendous glare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_21:1.0000:Yet merciful and kind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_22:1.0000:Bears on the wings of vital air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_23:1.0000:What ominous we find.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0042_24:1.0000:The evening star, the setting sun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_3:0.9750:Foretelling dearth or feast.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_4:1.0000:The Ocean's ebb and flow v divide
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_5:1.0000:The wealth of land and sea ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_6:0.9750:Propelling forth the well known tide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_7:0.9500:In reciprocity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_8:1.0000:The Moon, with her attractive power,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_9:0.9750:Alternate full and change,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_10:1.0000:Ordain' d to cast the fruitful shower,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_11:1.0000:Or drought within her range.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_12:1.0000:The Pleiades bright and glist'ning, stud
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_13:0.9500:Yon canopy above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_14:0.9750:And all prognosticate the good,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_15:1.0000:To man bequeath'd in love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_16:1.0000:The whistling winds, the storms and frost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_17:0.9500:Alike in sound advise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_18:1.0000:We mortals, by the tempest tost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_19:0.9750:And teach us to be wise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_20:1.0000:The contemplative mind of man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_21:0.9500:Hath privilege bestow' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_22:1.0000:Wherewith to hear and see the plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_23:0.9750:With faculties endow' d.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_24:1.0000:Until the scenes of time are past,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_25:1.0000:And constellations cease ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_26:1.0000:Then he shall take a fairer cast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_27:0.9750:With all its bright increase.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_28:1.0000:Where knowledge, wisdom, truth, and light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_30:0.9750:By virtue of our Saviour's might,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_31:0.9500:We life eternal gain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_32:0.9750:Whose voice through every thing is heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0043_33:0.9750:In truth and love sincere ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_4:0.9750:Mankind in the gross, will seldom attend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_5:0.9750:To truth in its loveliest form ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_6:0.9500:But when the bell rings, " Thy life's at an end ! "
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_13:1.0000:When death calls them hence to remove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_14:1.0000:Then the message they hear, nor can they deny,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_15:0.9750:The monster in person is sent ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_16:1.0000:To issue the edict, " This day thou shalt die,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_17:1.0000:No time is there now to repent." —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_18:1.0000:The man who postpones the momentous affair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_19:1.0000:Of life's preparation for death ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_20:1.0000:Will find in the end, not a moment to spare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_21:0.9750:When his spirit is gasping for breath !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_22:1.0000:Yon creature behold, on the extreme of time !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_23:0.9750:With ardent desire to save
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_24:1.0000:The soul that is passing, to nothing sublime ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0044_25:0.9500:Whose body is verging the grave !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_1:0.9500:All his work to begin, when it ought to end ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_2:1.0000:He sees what is lost by delay :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_3:1.0000:The night has arriv'd, when he cannot attend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_5:0.9750:Now the message conies home, the which to fulfil,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_6:0.9500:His day of probation is by ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_7:1.0000:Nor can it return, but to answer the bill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_8:0.9750:Prepared or not, " Thou must die !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_9:0.9750:In deep consternation he lifts up his head,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_10:0.9500:And looks with an eye full of sorrow ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_11:0.9500:The blow is now struck, and the man is laid dead !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_17:0.9500:Will truth in every shape declare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_18:0.9750:And publish every sin.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_19:1.0000:A guilty conscience, who can bear
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_20:0.9750:The keen tormenting smart ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_21:1.0000:Which haunts the rebel every where,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_22:1.0000:And cute him to the heart !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_23:1.0000:The wounds inflicted by the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_24:1.0000:In pangs of horror deep ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_25:1.0000:Are such as torture all his frame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0045_26:0.9750:Nor can he rest in sleep.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_1:1.0000:With solemn tone the larum rings r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_2:1.0000:To warn him of his state ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_3:1.0000:And with its pointed arrow, stings
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_4:1.0000:The victim,, soon or late.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_5:1.0000:Whose midnight hours are pass'd in pain,,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_6:1.0000:From which has no release ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_7:0.9750:By day the conscience speaks again,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_8:1.0000:Nor ever holds its peace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_9:0.9500:The restless waves are never still,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_10:1.0000:Casting up dirt and mire ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_11:1.0000:(The Scripture statement to fulfil ;)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_12:1.0000:Pregnant with vengeful ire ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_13:1.0000:Thus raging ever in the breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_14:0.9750:And penetrates the soul ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_15:1.0000:That never, never, can have rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_16:1.0000:While endless ages roll.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_17:1.0000:'Twill teaze, and gnaw, likewise corrode,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_18:1.0000:As doth the canker-worm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_19:1.0000:Terraqeous matter can't afford,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_20:1.0000:A shelter in the storm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_21:1.0000:Then whither shall I move to be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_22:1.0000:At liberty from sin ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_23:0.9750:And have my guilty conscience free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_24:1.0000:From hellish rage within.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_25:1.0000:The privilege of man is this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_26:1.0000:To quit his guilt on earth :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_27:1.0000:By which to gain eternal bliss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_28:0.9750:Must have the second birth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_29:1.0000:And then the spirit's evidence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0046_32:0.9500:Hath pardon'd all his sin !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_2:1.0000:Which makes the storm a calm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_3:1.0000:The guilty conscience is at rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_4:0.9500:From all impending harm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_10:0.9500:And are anxious to have it in hand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_11:0.9500:Then what about friends, when they see you go wrong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_12:0.9500:Will they state the default as a friend ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_13:0.9750:Or lull you to sleep in the same, with a song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_14:1.0000:Till your practice brings life to an end.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_15:0.9750:They'll let you slide on with the bottle in hand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_16:0.9500:You may drink of the poisonous glass ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_17:0.9500:That they may obtain all your money and land,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_18:0.9750:Do allow the sad blunder to pass.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_19:0.9750:Then, the bag they receive with all its contents,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_20:1.0000:And the land in possession they have ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_22:0.9500:To the body, and that is the grave !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_23:0.9750:But what about friends, when the man is no more,-
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0047_24:0.9750:Subject to their envious eye ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_2:0.9500:Not thinking they also must die !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_4:0.9750:Pass'd away and left it to them ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_5:1.0000:Yet, something remains that eternal shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_6:1.0000:Immortal ! the soul is the gem !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_7:1.0000:The casket in which the same was contain'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_8:1.0000:Has gone to a mortal decay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_9:1.0000:The enemy thus, hath the victory gain'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_10:1.0000:And he, may have lost the best day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_11:1.0000:For want of reproof, and advice of a friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_12:1.0000:With a heart that is right and sincere ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_13:1.0000:Who would honesty, truth, and charity blend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_14:1.0000:To point him the way he should steer.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_15:1.0000:Devoid of duplicity, cunning, and guile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_16:0.9750:Whose motive is wholesome and pure ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_17:1.0000:Nor varnish the ill, by a comical smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_18:1.0000:That he may his treasure procure !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_22:0.9500:A bold one, a conqueror ! valiant and brave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0048_23:1.0000:Who never was known to do wrong !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_4:1.0000:With justice and equity, perfect and sure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_5:1.0000:To bear the impression divine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_6:1.0000:But one, in the universe ever was found
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_7:0.9500:To answer the character given ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_8:1.0000:Who conquer' d the world, by a principle sound ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_9:0.9500:And firm as the pillars of heaven !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_13:0.9500:Unto itself, nor dreading pain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_14:1.0000:From this illegal state.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_15:0.9750:Where, nothing to the man belongs,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_16:0.9750:But shame and sad disgrace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_17:0.9750:By perpetration of the wrongs,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_18:1.0000:Which mark his pallid face.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_19:1.0000:Where is the wise ? where is the scribe ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_20:0.9750:Where is the vain disputer ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_21:1.0000:'Mid light utopean flush to bribe
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_22:0.9750:Themselves, to gain a suitor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_23:1.0000:Or false applause, from whom they deem
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_24:1.0000:In rank of noble station ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_25:1.0000:Yet, hold tbem nothing in esteem,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_26:0.9750:Except their approbation.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0049_27:1.0000:The self deceiving path they tread,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_2:1.0000:To call the bitter sweet.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_3:1.0000:Contrary to their wish or will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_4:1.0000:In error those remain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_5:1.0000:The truth, by falsehood to fulfil,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_6:1.0000:Which terminates in pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_7:1.0000:The humble soul alone is sure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_8:1.0000:To meet with approbation ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_9:1.0000:From him whose heart is always pure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_10:1.0000:And fills the highest station !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_11:0.9750:In earth, and heaven, reigning supreme ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_12:1.0000:None ever soar'd above ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_13:1.0000:He surely merits all esteem,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_14:1.0000:Whose smile is life and love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_18:1.0000:And think it high time to repent
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_19:1.0000:Of all my former evil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_20:1.0000:'Tis ten to one, that fifty more
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_21:1.0000:I here remain on earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_22:1.0000:To pay on equal terms, the score
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_23:1.0000:Contracted from my birth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_24:1.0000:The good, the bad, the great, the small,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0050_26:1.0000:In this account have naught at all,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_2:1.0000:The day before to-morrow ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_3:1.0000:Not one good deed* have I to pay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_4:1.0000:The debt, I own with sorrow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_5:1.0000:If this be true, to it attend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_6:0.9500:For Godly sorrow works,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_7:1.0000:Repentance,! that will gain a friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_8:0.9750:Tho' sin in secret lurks : —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_9:1.0000:Within the heart of man, we find
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_10:1.0000:The seat of every evil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_11:1.0000:So prevalent to all mankind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_12:0.9500:In service of the Devil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_13:0.9750:As Christ alone aton'd for sin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_14:1.0000:Our works can merit naught ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_15:1.0000:Therefore in time we must begin
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_16:1.0000:To seek salvation, bought
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_17:0.9500:By him, to all the world a friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_18:1.0000:Who died that each might live ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0051_19:1.0000:Altho' our sins we cannot mend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_2:1.0000:In lab'rinths high, and dignifi'd above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_3:0.9750:To shine in lustre, 'mid seraphic fire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_4:1.0000:Enkindl'd by the flame of perfect love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_5:1.0000:In that thrice blest abode of none create,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_6:0.9750:Superb, unequal, never ending store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_7:1.0000:Where each shall occupy their own estate !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_8:0.9500:Nor known, or seen, or occupi'd before.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_9:1.0000:Extent of which, and worth, we cannot count ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_10:0.9750:And yet the whole to man, is freely given,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_11:1.0000:That he may thus enjoy, and soaring mount
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_12:0.9750:On seraph's wings, to Gabriel's seat in heaven !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_14:1.0000:For whom the costly sacrifice was not ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_15:1.0000:Or needed in the courts of heaven above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_16:1.0000:Where garments ne'er were tainted with a spot.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_17:0.9750:To mar their happiness, in bliss superb ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_18:0.9500:Who range elysian fields for ever green,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_19:0.9750:And bask beneath the most effulgent orb !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_22:0.9500:When faith, and hope in Christ, their end obtain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_23:1.0000:And by the resurrective power divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0052_24:0.9750:In full fruitive glory to remain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_7:1.0000:Where Chaos once did reign.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_8:1.0000:The massive, coarse, materials lay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_9:1.0000:Fast bound in her domains :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_10:1.0000:Till all her strings were made to play,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_11:1.0000:And sound their sweetest strains !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_12:1.0000:The earth's foundations form the base,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_13:1.0000:The tenor is the sea :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_14:0.9750:The air or wind is in the case,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_15:0.9750:To raise the harmony !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_16:1.0000:The morning stars in concert join,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_17:1.0000:The sun, and moon combine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_18:1.0000:To play their part in nature's tune,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_19:0.9500:And each alternate shine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_20:1.0000:Producing all the world contains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_21:1.0000:A splendid music ball !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0053_22:0.9750:And nothing of it now remains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_1:1.0000:So said the author of the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_2:1.0000:When he compos' d the piece ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_3:1.0000:And stamp'd thereon his honor'd name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_4:1.0000:To last, when time shall cease !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_5:1.0000:True time in music bears the palm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_6:1.0000:Where every part is free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_7:1.0000:Then each are consonant to charm
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_8:1.0000:Mankind, by land or sea.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_9:0.9750:No discord was there ever heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_10:1.0000:The rhythm is correct ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_11:1.0000:By continuity of word,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_13:1.0000:The God of nature, doth dispense
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_14:0.9750:Wisdom, to make us wise ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_15:1.0000:In this, the master poem, whence
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_16:1.0000:Our minor music rise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_17:1.0000:But, let us trace the seasons, where
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_18:0.9750:We have a grand display !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_19:1.0000:Of order, harmony, and care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_20:1.0000:Revolving night and day.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_21:1.0000:While in a sweet perennial move,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_22:1.0000:They surely glide along ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_23:1.0000:Conducted by the powers above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_24:0.9500:To whom they all belong.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_25:1.0000:The spring in verdant green is clad,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0054_26:1.0000:With fiow'rs of vari'd hue ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_1:0.9750:Which make the heart of man so glad,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_2:1.0000:The picture thus to view.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_3:1.0000:Then comes the summer months with heat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_4:1.0000:Maturing all that grows ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_5:0.9500:Which makes the bud, tho' bitter, sweet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_7:1.0000:On every living creature, when
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_8:1.0000:The autumn months succeed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_9:1.0000:Our graneries are stored then,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_10:1.0000:To give us winter feed. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_11:1.0000:While surly, bitter blasts prevail,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_12:1.0000:And raging billows roll ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_13:1.0000:Sweet poetry is in the gale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_14:1.0000:Sounding from pole to pole !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_15:1.0000:The feather'd tribe, all imitate
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_16:1.0000:Grand nature's gen'ral song ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_17:1.0000:Who never lost their first estate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_18:1.0000:Or sweet bibilian tongue ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_19:1.0000:With which the seasons harmonise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_20:1.0000:Our pleasure to enhance ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_21:1.0000:Who, in the scale of being rise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_22:1.0000:By order, " not by chance !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_23:0.9750:This organ sounds throughout the stage
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_24:1.0000:Of human life, as well
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0055_25:1.0000:In youth, in manhood, and old age,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_3:1.0000:What in the world can be more sweet :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_4:0.9500:When all unite to sing ? —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_6:0.9500:"lis harmony, when rightly understood,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_7:0.9750:Apparent dissonance educing good ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_8:0.9750:The planets, orbs, and all conspire to raise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_14:0.9750:A peevish, surly, sickly phiz,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_15:1.0000:Which none can much admire.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_17:1.0000:With pleasing manly grace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_18:1.0000:Not with hypocrisy and guile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_19:1.0000:But shew an honest face.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_20:1.0000:This feature, manifest without ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_22:1.0000:Will rid the mind of every doubt,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_23:1.0000:Likewise of every sin.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_25:1.0000:Which brings a lasting peace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0056_26:0.9750:In gen'rous actions ever warm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_1:1.0000:Your conscience clear without offence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_2:0.9750:Alike to God and man ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_3:0.9750:By which you harbour no pretence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_4:0.9750:But use the honest plan.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_5:0.9750:This principle in practise, must
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_6:0.9750:Familiarize the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_7:0.9750:And all your trafic will be just,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_8:0.9750:In whatsoever game.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_9:1.0000:Sheer petulance, and discontent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_10:1.0000:Must all be done away ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_11:1.0000:And then your comfort will augment
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_12:0.9750:In practise every day.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_13:1.0000:Peace, and good- will are ever near ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_14:0.9750:An easy sweet reply,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_15:1.0000:Is better than the rough and queer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_16:0.9750:Which gender such thereby.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_17:1.0000:Virtue, in wisdom's ways will shew
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_18:1.0000:The man, a lovely creature !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_19:1.0000:Striving to put an end to woe,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_20:1.0000:In word, in deed, and feature.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_21:1.0000:Upright in heart, in life, and will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_22:1.0000:Your way to glory pave !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_23:0.9750:Whereby you emulate the skill
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_24:1.0000:And practise of the brave.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_25:1.0000:This second nature, have you found,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_26:1.0000:Which custom doth create ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_27:1.0000:If bas'd on virtues solid ground,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_28:0.9500:It forms your best estate !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_29:0.9750:Then practice truth, without delay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0057_31:0.9500:Yourself, in virtues lovely way ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_3:0.9500:While some have none, who can ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_4:0.9750:This Problem I'll disclose to thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_5:1.0000:The mind's the eye of man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_6:1.0000:Yet some have mind, who will not think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_7:1.0000:Of aught to do them good,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_8:1.0000:At best advice will often wink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_9:1.0000:And spoil their mental food.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_10:1.0000:The table's set, and neatly spread,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_11:1.0000:With every dainty, free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_12:1.0000:To suit the living, (not the dead,) —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_13:1.0000:Who feign they cannot see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_14:0.9750:There's none so deaf as those, who wont
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_15:0.9500:Adhere to what is said ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_16:0.9750:Tho', when they would, perhaps they can't ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_17:0.9500:The music organ's fled !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_18:0.9750:And then they'll ask, what did you say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_19:1.0000:I thought I heard a noise ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_20:1.0000:Through inattention, or delay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_21:1.0000:Have lost superior joys.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_22:1.0000:But now, 'tis over late to hear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_23:1.0000:Or see, or even think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_24:1.0000:Calamities will soon appear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_25:1.0000:Then, who shall laugh and wink ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_26:1.0000:Ocular Gents, with boasting, say —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_27:0.9750:We hear and see, " all's right" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_28:0.9750:Tho' they in darkness spent the day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0058_29:0.9500:And now, behold, 'tis night !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_2:0.9500:I Ogl an you profess the Christan name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_3:0.9500:frtPi Wno h arDour i n your breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_4:0.9500:A disposition for the game,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_5:1.0000:Which Christians all detest ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_6:1.0000:You're educated, sir, but where ?—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_7:1.0000:Were you in College bred ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_8:1.0000:And did you get your lessons there,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_9:0.9750:To furnish heart and head ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_10:1.0000:Collegians, some are apt to think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_11:0.9750:Obtain whate'er they need,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_12:1.0000:Just there, and scarce have time to link,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_13:0.9750:Good matter with the seed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_14:1.0000:Their station's fixt, and off they run,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_15:1.0000:To sow the same " broad-cast ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_16:1.0000:Who think, at start, the work is done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_17:0.9750:Bring empty sheaves, at last.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_18:1.0000:A Minister, you may be here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_19:0.9750:Well tutor' d in the College ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_20:1.0000:And yet, for want of wisdom, steer
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_21:1.0000:Contrary to your knowledge.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_22:0.9750:Let man be what he does profess,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_23:1.0000:And truth improve the same ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_24:0.9750:Then honesty will not caress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0059_25:0.9750:A useless, empty name.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_4:1.0000:(As some old people oft have said)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_5:0.9750:Prancing on Coatham green.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_6:1.0000:The lad was sat in chimney-nook,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_7:1.0000:Affecting there to read ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_8:1.0000:Attention soon was from the book,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_9:1.0000:His heart began to bleed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_10:1.0000:He knew the work that he'd to do,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_11:1.0000:Would subject him to fright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_12:1.0000:For he'd to go with boot or shoe
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_13:1.0000:To Redcar, late at night.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_14:1.0000:So now from old Tom Cooper's shop,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_15:1.0000:He started off forsooth :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_16:1.0000:Nor could he half a moment stop,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_17:1.0000:His heart beat to his mouth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_18:1.0000:Full speed he ran, the night was dark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_19:1.0000:His feet scarce touch' d the ground ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_20:1.0000:For still in view he kept the mark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_21:1.0000:And quickly look'd around.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_22:1.0000:While apparitions fill'd the mind
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0060_23:1.0000:Of this deluded lad,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_2:1.0000:Enough to make him mad.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_3:1.0000:Full half a mile had he to go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_4:0.9750:But wasn't he afraid ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_5:1.0000:While things were prancing too and fro,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_6:0.9750:A monster there was laid ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_7:1.0000:O'er which he fell, it roar'd amain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_8:1.0000:The asses loudest bray ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_9:1.0000:Tremendous sound, now echo'd round ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_10:0.9750:John up, and ran away.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_11:1.0000:For when he saw its lugs upright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_12:0.9750:And felt its hairy skin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_13:1.0000:Both it, and he, were in a fright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_14:1.0000:Tho' neither caught by sin.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_15:1.0000:His bundle from his bosom flew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_16:0.9750:No time had he to stop,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_17:1.0000:But click' d, and ran, for well he knew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_18:1.0000:That he was from his shop.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_19:1.0000:His courage rose, and hope reviv'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_20:1.0000:Tho' nearly out of breath ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_21:1.0000:He thought those folks had just contriv'd
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_22:0.9750:To frighten him to death.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_23:1.0000:From this you learn that simple youth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_25:1.0000:But while I do elicit truth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0061_26:0.9750:Attend to what you read.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_1:1.0000:This narrative is stated clear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_2:1.0000:Without a fictious joint ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_3:1.0000:That each may by the compass steer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_4:0.9750:And mark the finest point.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_6:0.9750:And I've the subject seen ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_7:1.0000:Who told me all that you have heard, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_12:1.0000:Full twenty pounds I do require
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_13:1.0000:Of you, who can the same command,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_14:1.0000:To liberate my fetter' d hand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_15:1.0000:For want of which, I dormant lay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_16:1.0000:Nor e'er can travel on my way —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_17:1.0000:To sell the goods I cannot get ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_18:0.9750:Without the cash, I'm nearly bet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_19:0.9750:So here at anchor I remain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_20:0.9750:Till money starts me off again :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_21:1.0000:Now, if your will be one with mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_22:1.0000:The small request you won't decline.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_23:1.0000:If not, you may be sure of this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_24:1.0000:The talent, buri'd, is amiss ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_25:1.0000:By none improvement of your store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0062_26:1.0000:You'll lose the sum, and get no more.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_1:0.9750:But, if you listen to the call
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_2:1.0000:Of Him, the owner of us all,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_3:1.0000:The int'rest, with the sum you'll get ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_4:1.0000:He'll not allow us to be bet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_5:1.0000:Who owns the silver and the gold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_6:0.9750:By which, good things are bought and sold ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_7:1.0000:And, as he's furnish'd you with such, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_8:1.0000:You must not think I ask too much.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_9:0.9750:To grant the same, as I request,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_10:1.0000:And leave to you, and God, the rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_11:1.0000:Who bids you now, to others do,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_12:1.0000:As you'd have others do to you.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_16:0.9750:Will never use the rake and fork,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_17:1.0000:Nor have his fallow sown.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_18:1.0000:This factious man can never rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_19:1.0000:Contented in his station ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_20:0.9750:Disconsolate, and sore opprest
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_21:0.9750:Is he, without occasion.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_22:1.0000:Oft, in society you'll find
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_23:0.9750:This sad tormenting pest —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_24:1.0000:With language, anything but kind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0063_25:0.9750:Whose heart's a filthy nest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_1:1.0000:Tho' " right in all his ways," no doubt
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_2:1.0000:He fancies he is pure —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_3:1.0000:On him, instructions tell for naught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_4:1.0000:He has no faults to cure !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_5:1.0000:" Self righteous men" are ever clean,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_6:1.0000:And good in their own eyes —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_7:1.0000:Just in this character is seen —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_8:1.0000:The fool, who thinks he's wise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_9:1.0000:Thus, to the jaundic'd eye appear
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_10:0.9500:The vari'd colours one, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_11:1.0000:Altho' it seems so vague and queer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_12:1.0000:The sense of sight is gone.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_13:1.0000:All faults, they see by others done ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_14:1.0000:But can't discern their own —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_15:1.0000:And thus deluded, travel on,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_16:0.9750:Till cataracts are grown. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_17:1.0000:A pellicle to say the least,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_18:1.0000:Doth cover half his eye :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_19:1.0000:On whose sleek forehead " mark the beast,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_20:1.0000:Which kills him on the sly !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_21:1.0000:Avoid the same, my friends, while you,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_22:1.0000:Have eyes wherewith to see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_23:1.0000:Now, give to each the credit due —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0064_24:0.9750:And let your neighbours be.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_4:0.9500:I, brigbter scenes sball surely know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_5:1.0000:Tban tbose we mortals see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_6:0.9750:Yon boary mountains boldly stand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_7:1.0000:Out-riding every storm !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_8:0.9750:And take tbe bitter blast by band,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_10:1.0000:Yea, all tbe " Hills," are clad in wbite !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_11:0.9500:And rob'd from top to toe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_12:1.0000:Studded with pearly drops, (so bright,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_13:0.9750:Which dazzle all below. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_14:1.0000:Keen blows the wind, o'er sea and land
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_16:0.9750:By him, who hath the sole command,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_17:1.0000:Creating night and day.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_18:0.9750:The fruit — the Fir tree, and the Pine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_19:0.9500:Whose sap lay under ground,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_20:1.0000:In white habiliments do shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_21:1.0000:All trimm'd with frost around.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_22:1.0000:While in the valley here below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_23:1.0000:So splendid is the view !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_24:1.0000:The earth is cover'd o'er with snow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_25:1.0000:The eaves are pearly dew. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_26:1.0000:The Bird with plaintive note is heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_27:1.0000:While rustling winds alarm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0065_28:0.9750:The stalled Ox, the bell' wing herd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_2:1.0000:And every prospect blight :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_3:1.0000:A better subject now be mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_4:0.9750:" The day succeeds the night." —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_6:1.0000:The sun begins to peep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_7:1.0000:And spread his rays with brilliant cast ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_8:1.0000:All nature wakes from sleep.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_9:1.0000:Now, spring arrives, and all appears
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_10:0.9750:In bloom, and beauty fair !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_11:0.9750:Dispeling carping doubts, and fears ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_12:0.9750:'Mid sweet salubrious air.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_13:1.0000:Here, all the Feather-tribe rejoice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_14:1.0000:And hail the sunny day —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_16:1.0000:As in the month of May.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_17:0.9500:They serenade their sweet abodes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_18:1.0000:In flow'ry verdure clad ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_19:0.9750:While all the scenery affords
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_20:1.0000:Occasion to be glad.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_21:0.9750:Altho' their tongue was nearly mute,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_22:1.0000:Each now rejoice to see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_23:1.0000:The earth has swallow' d winter's suit !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_24:1.0000:And set her captives free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_25:1.0000:Sol, " in the southern hemisphere,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_26:0.9500:Doth cast a brilliant eye,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_27:0.9500:" On every Island," far, and near ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_28:0.9500:And shall I tell you why ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_30:0.9750:Our benefactor, he —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_31:0.9750:Who rides above, on seraph's wings,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0066_32:0.9500:And rules both land and sea.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_1:1.0000:The wind and storm, his voice obey ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_3:0.9750:Own his supremacy and sway,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_4:1.0000:At whose command they thaw.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_5:1.0000:The elements are in his hand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_6:1.0000:Yea, he controls the whole
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_8:0.9500:And in an instant fall !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_9:0.9750:Here, while the blast of life may blow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_10:0.9750:With Winter's pinching smart ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_11:1.0000:Let us this lesson learn, and know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_12:0.9750:What thaws the frozen heart !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_13:1.0000:Above terraqueous things may we,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_14:0.9500:Look up to him who said,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_15:0.9500:" Stretch forth thy wither' d hand to me,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_16:0.9750:Who rais'd to life, the dead.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_17:1.0000:True faith we now must exercise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_18:1.0000:■In Christ, call'd forth to prove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_19:1.0000:And test the virtue of the wise :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_20:1.0000:Who live, and hope, and love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_21:1.0000:A soul within, each have to save,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_22:1.0000:Nature must change her form !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_23:1.0000:Ere we the bitter blast can brave ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_24:1.0000:And out-ride every storm. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_25:1.0000:The sun of righteousness shall rise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_26:1.0000:With healing on his wings !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0067_27:1.0000:To claim the Church " his only prize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_7:0.9750:This world is an apple we hite.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_8:1.0000:And each have a taste for it, bitter or sweet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_11:0.9750:And set the young teeth quite on edge.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_12:0.9750:Hoarding up, dividing, or parceling out,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_13:1.0000:A shadow they cannot retain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_14:0.9500:The wealthy possessor shall own it is nought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_15:1.0000:The bubble is bursting again !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_17:0.9750:Wherein he was conquer'd at last !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_18:0.9500:By the wind, which to him the message unfurl'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_19:1.0000:Nor could he bear under the blast.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_20:1.0000:The grace of contentment, can not be obtain'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_21:0.9500:From any terraqueous stuff!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_23:0.9750:The world, and he hadn't enough.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_24:0.9750:The internal jewel was never found there,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0068_26:1.0000:For he sat down and wept, worn out in despair !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_5:0.9500:To choose, and take true friendship by the hand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_6:0.9750:Here, love in shady lone retirement,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_8:0.9750:While heart and mind have peace with true content !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_10:0.9750:Inspir'd by noble sentiment, to rise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_11:0.9750:Above low thoughted vice, and paltry joy;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_12:1.0000:To mount on earth, and soar above the skies —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_13:1.0000:Where nothing can tranquility annoy.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_14:1.0000:And while in " solitude " we learn forsooth
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_19:1.0000:And morbid passions of the soul, abate :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_20:0.9750:While motives of the heart, are all sincere !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_21:1.0000:In this delightful, " solitary state !" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_22:0.9750:The thorny paths of life, are strew'd with flowers,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_23:0.9500:And balmy sweets, perfume the murky shade :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_24:0.9500:While in those happy, free, sequester' d bowers,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_25:0.9500:Enjoy the music of the serenade !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_26:0.9500:Ah, lovely " solitude !" the lone retreat ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0069_28:0.9750:Where friendship, love, and truth, together meet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_2:0.9750:Secluded from the public maze, she rides !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_4:1.0000:And moves anon, with vivid, rapid strides :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_9:0.9750:Her sole delight is, on the same to wait.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_12:1.0000:This grand, unique, embellishment of soul,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_13:1.0000:Displays its lustre in the mental fields. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_14:0.9500:Ah, lovely " solitude !" at home with thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_18:0.9500:May I such company encourage here !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_19:0.9750:As is alone befitting man to keep : —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_20:0.9750:Discarding doubt, distress, and morbid fear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_21:0.9500:Rejoic'd awake, and sooth'd in balmy sleep.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_28:0.9750:And thus, the tenor of the human mind
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_29:0.9750:Is held secure, where pleasures never cease ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_30:0.9750:The prowess of the soul, is all awake,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_31:0.9750:With energetic strength its way pursue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_32:0.9750:In lovely fields of fruit, of which partake,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0070_33:0.9750:And thus, again the faculties renew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_2:0.9500:The proper time, to court her winning smiles ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_4:0.9750:Where ills, oft menace, and deceit beguiles.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_5:0.9750:High privileg'd is man, with golden days !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_6:0.9750:Wherein, he may with all his ransom'd pow'rs,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_10:0.9500:To entertain the honor'd " Prince of Peace !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_14:0.9500:His own new name he gives, likewise the seal ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_15:0.9500:To shew that man, is now, and ever bless'd !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_22:0.9750:But, let us commence with her eminent hills,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0071_23:0.9750:Thence, survey the valley below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_2:1.0000:And we have the benefit here.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_3:1.0000:So rurally situate, not in the dark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_4:0.9500:" The Paradisiacal spot !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_5:1.0000:Resounds with the musical notes of the Lark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_6:1.0000:And Birds in the grove and the grot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_7:1.0000:While the rays of the Sun obliquely may shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_8:1.0000:And tinge the grand scenery around ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_9:1.0000:The prospect of all is assuredly mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_10:0.9750:When love in the centre is found.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_11:0.9500:These high tow'ring " Hills," are with riches replete !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_13:1.0000:For us, in addition to every thing sweet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_14:1.0000:What could he have done for us more ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_15:1.0000:Predicted we have, " Isaiah foretold,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_16:1.0000:That the hills so barren, should be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_17:1.0000:A source of much fruit, which now we behold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_18:0.9750:In " Cleveland," the top of the tree !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_19:1.0000:No more need I say on this topic, I'm sure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_20:1.0000:Th' inhabitants see, know, and feel,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_21:1.0000:All the comforts of life are now made secure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_22:0.9750:To those who appreciate weal.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_23:1.0000:This demands gratitude, the spring of content,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_24:1.0000:And mother of all we possess !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_25:1.0000:Which ever gives birth to the principal lent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_26:1.0000:But never will harbour distress.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_27:0.9750:The Father of all we enjoy is the Lord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_29:0.9750:Who winds up the same, with the union cord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_30:1.0000:And love is the handmaid at birth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0072_32:0.9500:True happiness is the result ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_2:1.0000:As stars in the heav'nly vault.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_3:0.9500:A wonderful Progeny ever shall bear
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_4:1.0000:The badge of the honor' d and free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_5:0.9500:And none but the blessed on earth shall be there,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_6:0.9750:To enjoy the fruit of the Tree.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_7:1.0000:Altho' the bright Canaan is bounded by seas,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_8:1.0000:And the swellings of Jordan arise ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_9:0.9500:All the universe now, may come if they please,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0073_10:1.0000:And cleave the good land for a prize !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0074_7:0.9500:Where sounds the echo ! on wings of the gale.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_1:0.9500:All you possess then, in him is the store !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_2:0.9750:More than I've raention'd, abundantly more :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_10:0.9750:Then shall I ask, (without delay,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_11:1.0000:Art thou of evil shorn ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_12:1.0000:The answer is, no doubt of that ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_14:1.0000:Was born, and liv'd, and died, for what
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_15:1.0000:Is term'd " the precious gem." —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_16:1.0000:'Twas Christ who did redeem thy soul
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_17:1.0000:From every native sin ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_18:1.0000:That thou might drink the crystal bowl ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_19:1.0000:"With fountain fix'd within. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_20:1.0000:To every child of man he gave
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_21:0.9750:A portion of his spirit ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_22:1.0000:To profit by, the soul to save !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_23:1.0000:And life, and bliss inherit.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_24:1.0000:This privilege is thine, my Child,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_25:0.9750:Through grace alone 'tis giv'n
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_26:0.9500:Thy name is on the pages fil'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0075_27:0.9750:And ratified in heav'n !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_1:0.9750:The twenty-first of June, gave birth
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_2:1.0000:To thee, my only son ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_3:1.0000:Now station' d on this Planet, (Earth,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_4:1.0000:Thy heavenly course to run.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_5:1.0000:So run that thou obtain the prize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_6:1.0000:The pearl of greatest price ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_7:1.0000:Where Sun's immortal ever rise !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_8:0.9750:On Wisdom's merchandise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_9:0.9750:Thus then, " the longest day," to thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_10:1.0000:Is realiz'd indeed !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_11:1.0000:And joys eternal, ever be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_12:0.9500:Possess'd, in time of need.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_15:0.9750:In thy unique estate ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_16:1.0000:Where happiness shall ever be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_17:1.0000:And bliss can ne'er abate.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_18:1.0000:But what am I now speaking of :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_19:1.0000:Is this the fruit of earth ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_20:1.0000:Or is it the product of Love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_21:1.0000:Commencing with its birth ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_22:0.9750:And who is he, who thus can speak,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_23:1.0000:Of comfort, joy, and peace ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_24:1.0000:A worm, whom Jesus " came to seek,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_25:1.0000:T' enjoy its vast increase !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_26:0.9750:Then will I strive for this to-day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0076_27:1.0000:Or it may be too late :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_1:0.9750:As time and tide can never stay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_2:0.9750:Nor on a mortal wait,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_3:0.9750:To-day, before to-morrow's sun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_4:1.0000:I may be call'd away ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_5:1.0000:And then tb' estate is lost, or won ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_6:1.0000:Throughout the longest day. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_7:1.0000:I now have reach' d my fortieth year ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_8:0.9750:The central age of man ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_9:1.0000:In vigour, and in health appear !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_10:0.9750:Tho' life is but a span.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_11:1.0000:My longest day has just gone by
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_12:1.0000:I'm verging down the hill :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_13:1.0000:The wheels of life, (so often dry!)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_14:0.9750:Will soon be standing still.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_15:1.0000:The oil of grace, can only give,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_17:0.9750:(That when this body dies,) to live !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_18:0.9750:And drink the crystal bowl.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_19:1.0000:The three score years and ten may be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_20:0.9750:My full allotment here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_21:1.0000:But should I not that number see :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_22:1.0000:I'll have my passport clear ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_23:1.0000:As now, my vessel is in time,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_24:0.9750:Tho' on the ocean toss'd ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_25:0.9750:'Tis bound for yon superior clime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_26:1.0000:Where, not one soul is lost !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_27:1.0000:This gives me consolation sweet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_29:1.0000:Altho' cross winds, and tempests meet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0077_31:0.9750:I've rail'd, and built up many a ship,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_1:0.9750:And launch' d the same from off my slip
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_2:1.0000:To gain an earthly portion.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_3:1.0000:I cannot tell the number cross' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_4:1.0000:The equinoctial line !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_5:1.0000:Nor yet the men or vessels lost :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_6:1.0000:Which once I counted mine. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_7:1.0000:But, thanks to God, my little bark
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_8:0.9750:"Wherein the " Gem " is found !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_9:1.0000:Possesses much, the vital spark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_10:1.0000:To " Canaan" now is bound. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_11:0.9500:Blow, breezes blow, in gentle gales,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_12:0.9750:And waft the Cargo on ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_13:0.9750:To where the Harbour never fails ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_15:0.9750:The vessel that sails on the ocean of time :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_16:0.9750:Is sure to be wreck'd in the end !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_17:1.0000:Tho' the crew may obtain a heavenly clime.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0078_23:0.9500:And give themselves a splendid toast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_1:0.9750:By artful schemes, nor mean and low ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_2:1.0000:We stand above the rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_3:1.0000:Who make a turgid glit'ring show !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_4:1.0000:We've feather' d well our nest —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_5:1.0000:And thus, in arrogance and pride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_7:0.9750:Unto themselves, and none beside !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_8:1.0000:This fact is understood.*
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_9:1.0000:With all, a portion they have not,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_10:1.0000:To give unto the poor ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_11:1.0000:But quickly drive them off their spot :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_12:1.0000:To beg from door to door.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_13:1.0000:Tho' when reverse of fortune takes
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_14:1.0000:Possession of their store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_15:1.0000:The morbid sense so quickly wakes !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_16:1.0000:Which slept too long before.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_17:1.0000:Now, half stagnated at the change,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_18:1.0000:They rub their eyes to see !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_19:0.9750:And think the circumstance so strange,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_20:1.0000:Wond'ring how this can be !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_21:0.9750:They lay the blame on men, and things,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_23:0.9750:" That Nature has her secret springs,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_24:0.9500:Nor can she do amiss. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_25:0.9750:Nevertheless, such will contend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_26:0.9750:That Providence is wrong ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_27:1.0000:Which might the subject vastly mend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_28:0.9750:And never use the thong.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0079_29:0.9750:This, they consider cruel then
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_1:0.9500:For they are just, and honest men ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_2:1.0000:But cannot pay expenses. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_3:1.0000:As such, they think the charge is due,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_4:0.9750:From those who wealth possess !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_5:1.0000:And pinch them, with the magic screw ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_6:0.9500:Wisdom, can not do less. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_7:1.0000:Just so, thy judgment now seems right,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_9:1.0000:Then lure kind Providence to bite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_10:1.0000:The man possessed of pelf.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_11:1.0000:Thou art the man, " The very man !*
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_12:1.0000:Who boasted of thy store,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_13:1.0000:So he who gave, must use his fan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_14:1.0000:And cast it on the shore.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_15:1.0000:In ostentatious pomp and pride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0080_17:1.0000:The way of Providence deride ;

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_1:1.0000:Where this is right, it pleases much.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_18:1.0000:By boiling bops and barley ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_19:1.0000:They drink, and sell, and read the news,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_20:1.0000:That comes both late and early.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_21:1.0000:These men, were bred up in the trade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_22:1.0000:And thought it very good !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_23:0.9750:Till deep conviction wrought, and made
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_24:0.9750:The matter understood.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_25:1.0000:By dreams, and visions of the night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0086_26:0.9500:The truth is sometimes known ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_1:1.0000:When horrid deeds are brought to light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_2:1.0000:And mysteries are shown ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_3:1.0000:Just so with Tom who said, he had
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_4:1.0000:A solemn warning given ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_5:1.0000:" A man by drinking, ran clean mad !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_6:1.0000:And miss'd his way to heaven. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_7:1.0000:This thought engag'd his panting breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_8:1.0000:And fill'd him with dismay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_9:1.0000:Am I the man, excluded guest ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_10:1.0000:And shall I miss my way ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_11:1.0000:Just as we sow, we soon shall reap :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_12:1.0000:And what will be the crop ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_13:1.0000:I've through the vista, had a peep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_14:1.0000:Base traffic, now I'll drop.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_15:1.0000:Determin'd, while I have a chance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_16:0.9750:To do my duty here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_17:0.9750:Nor condemnation to enhance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_19:0.9750:Or any other poisonous stuff,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_20:1.0000:Which robs man of his reason ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_21:1.0000:It is the case, Dick, sure enough,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_22:1.0000:Let's take the hint in season." —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_23:1.0000:Said he to Tom, " I can't but think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_24:1.0000:A vast of brass we've made,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_25:1.0000:By brewing up, and selling drink ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_26:0.9500:It is a famous trade !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_28:0.9750:With body round and stout ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_29:0.9750:Which soon may sink, and die away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_30:0.9500:And then it's good for nought. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0087_32:0.9750:On some unlucky day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_1:1.0000:You lose your crop, the stock and all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_3:0.9750:" Well Dick, when that may be, who knows
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_4:0.9750:Thou brews this horrid stuff !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_5:1.0000:Which strikes so many deadly blows,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_6:1.0000:And makes the path so rough. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_7:1.0000:We've traded thus together long,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_8:1.0000:And drank a vast ourselves ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_9:1.0000:By which to swell the wretched throng,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_10:0.9500:Of Satan and his elves. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_11:1.0000:Thy case is quite as bad as mine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_12:1.0000:If thou will cease to brew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_13:1.0000:I'll then pull down my Public Sign,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_14:1.0000:And never, never rue." —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_15:0.9750:A verse Tom wish'd me to compose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_16:1.0000:Which I shall now relate ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_18:1.0000:Nor lay the poisonous bait."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_19:1.0000:Thus would he try to mend his plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_20:1.0000:As he'd found out the evil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_21:1.0000:He'd act the part so worthy man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_22:1.0000:And cheat the very Devil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_23:1.0000:Tom laugh'd right hearty at the song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_24:1.0000:So much delighted, he
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_25:1.0000:Would plaster' d up before 'twere long,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_26:0.9500:That every one might see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_27:1.0000:Ere this was done the brewer came,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_28:1.0000:And read the subject o'er ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_29:1.0000:Panegyriz'd the sober game,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_30:0.9750:Altho' his heart was sore.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0088_31:1.0000:He made a spring, and seiz'd the prize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_2:1.0000:To see the brewer's caper.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_3:1.0000:A.s off he cut, tho' smiling, vex'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_4:1.0000:Thus to behold his friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_5:1.0000:So much attach' d unto the text,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_6:1.0000:Which might their traffic end.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_7:1.0000:How this may turn, I cannot tell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_8:1.0000:As both convicted are ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_9:1.0000:If none would brew, then none could sell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_10:1.0000:And thus would end the war.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_12:0.9750:Mark ! all the world over, 'tis catch 'at catch can,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_14:1.0000:Not all these united will alter their plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_15:1.0000:Till abstinence, work them a cure !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_19:1.0000:Which can't its permanence maintain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_20:1.0000:To bless the visual light.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_21:1.0000:But those of which the heart partake,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_22:0.9750:Are solid and complete ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_23:1.0000:To comfort man, asleep or wake,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_24:0.9500:Whatever ills he meet.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_25:0.9750:Wherewith contentment he enjoys,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0089_26:1.0000:In sunshine, or in shade ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_1:1.0000:Whose mind is on the equipoise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_2:1.0000:Can through his troubles wade.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_3:1.0000:With manly strength, and fortitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_4:1.0000:He urges on his way,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_5:1.0000:No matter what the attitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_6:0.9750:Nor whether night, or day. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_7:1.0000:Redoubl'd, is prosperity,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_8:1.0000:To every generous mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_9:1.0000:And smooth' d is all adversity,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_11:1.0000:" The Widow's heart shall sing for joy,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_12:0.9750:Her Children too, rejoice ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_13:0.9500:The lovely Girl, the smiling Boy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_14:1.0000:Shall hear their father's voice !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_15:1.0000:Whose promise is while life remains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_16:1.0000:To act a parent's part ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_17:1.0000:Wherever light and truth obtains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_18:0.9750:There's music in the heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_19:0.9750:And all in sweet extatic song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_20:1.0000:Unite to praise his love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_21:1.0000:To whom the power and praise belong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_22:0.9750:Which nothing can remove. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_23:1.0000:The eyes of those, who once were blind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_24:1.0000:Can now with pleasure see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_25:1.0000:Jesus, their friend, for ever kind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_26:0.9750:Who sets the captive free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_27:1.0000:And " as an hart, the lame shall leap"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_28:0.9500:To run the Christian race ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_29:0.9750:They now rejoice, who once did weep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_30:0.9750:Are in a golden case !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0090_31:1.0000:As Jewels, safe from every ill ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_1:0.9750:Who bids the raging seas be still,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_2:0.9750:And quells the flippant qualms !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_3:1.0000:These all, shall flourish as a tree,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_4:1.0000:Set by the river side ;

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_8:1.0000:In whatsoever clime ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_9:1.0000:To serve its own, and foreign lands ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_10:1.0000:Throughout the length of time !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_11:1.0000:Nay, more, nor wither or decay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_12:1.0000:While endless ages roll :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_13:1.0000:But, flourish in eternal day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_22:0.9500:And thus made the truth to appear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_24:0.9750:And never to truth would adhere.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_25:0.9750:Tho' yet I am sat with the tipling quallie,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0091_26:1.0000:Propelling the theme of discourse ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_2:1.0000:And ride on the conquering Horse.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_3:0.9750:In wealth, and in splendour, to dash off awhile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_4:0.9750:Astonishing all the nobil,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_5:1.0000:Who nod as they pass, with a comical smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_6:1.0000:While bringing their corn to the mill.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_7:1.0000:Of whom, I obtain a full license to sell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_8:1.0000:And deal out the drops to a delver
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_9:1.0000:Who would up with his fist, the Landlord to fell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_10:1.0000:Yet I mind to pocket the silver.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_11:1.0000:And when the bell rings, I am there to attend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_12:1.0000:To all they request or require ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_13:1.0000:Tho' raps I receive at the hand of a friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_14:1.0000:I still add fuel to the fire.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_15:1.0000:But what shall I do at the close of my life ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_16:0.9750:When I can no longer attend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_17:1.0000:To the business I'm in, of tumult and strife ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_18:1.0000:My traffic will then have an end !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_19:0.9750:But, ah ! an account of the whole I must give !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_23:0.9750:From the lip of the Judge, the edict is giv'n,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_24:0.9500:" Depart to the bottomless pit ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_25:1.0000:For thou has no right to, or title to heav'n,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_27:0.9500:I'm now in the lake of eternal despair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_28:0.9750:Deploring my pitiless state !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_29:1.0000:With the rich man in hell, to mutter a prayer ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_30:0.9750:But ah ! 'tis for ever too late.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_31:1.0000:I am lost ! I am lost ! eternally lost :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0092_32:0.9500:Beyond the conception of man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_14:1.0000:Ambitious to soar and eternally rise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_15:1.0000:In sentiment wholly sublime '.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_18:1.0000:Where prospect is joyous, (of heavenly cast)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_19:1.0000:Your troubles, you give to the -wind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_20:1.0000:Sufficient of evil is that for the day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_21:1.0000:Why should you go meet it before ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0093_22:0.9750:Your privilege this is, to throw it away ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_1:0.9500:Then, onward you move, with the greatest delight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_2:1.0000:No trouble, or care to annoy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_3:1.0000:The soul that is happy, has heaven in sight ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_5:0.9750:The sentiment sweet, which enjoyment contains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_6:1.0000:Is more than the witty conceive :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_7:1.0000:But far less than nothing, is all that remains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_8:0.9500:To the man, who cannot believe.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_14:1.0000:Whose back is of its burden never eas'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_16:1.0000:And wish for what they ne'er in time shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_17:0.9750:Grudging their neighbour's store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_18:1.0000:A fruitless emblem of their poverty,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_19:1.0000:Whose practise brings them more.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_20:0.9750:This kind of wish, denotes possession lost.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_21:1.0000:By such as can't regain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0094_22:1.0000:Their best estate, is on the billows tost !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_3:1.0000:Unless he strive to be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_5:0.9500:To make himself thus free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_7:1.0000:Who passions bridle, and conduct their will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_8:1.0000:Against the latent foe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_14:0.9500:Tho' if they're deni'd, don't censure the deed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_15:1.0000:But take to yourself the whole blame.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_16:1.0000:Obtain them by honesty, wisdom, and care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_17:0.9750:Accept them so humbly and kind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_18:1.0000:With prudence to manage, and joyfully share,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_19:1.0000:The treasures of body and mind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_20:1.0000:Should all be suspended, with pleasure resign,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_21:1.0000:To the will of your Father above ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_22:1.0000:In whose splendid Image you're hoping to shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0095_23:1.0000:And bask in the beams of his love !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_1:1.0000:Whate'er be the station on earth you are in,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_2:0.9750:Let charity help you to steer
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_3:1.0000:Your course in the passage, to overcome sin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_4:0.9500:And conquer the world while you're here.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_6:0.9500:'Twas boundless love ordain'd the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_7:1.0000:Victorious you shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_9:1.0000:Is known from sea to sea!"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_10:1.0000:By whom in life and death supplied,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_11:1.0000:With everything we need ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_12:1.0000:And he who for us liv'd and died,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_20:0.9500:" His Body clad, and fed."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_21:1.0000:Perhaps the " Wit," may half be right,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_23:1.0000:He work, and study, day and night ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_24:1.0000:Better he'd not been born.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_25:1.0000:The latter thought, is not amiss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0096_26:1.0000:And yet he needs regard ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_2:0.9500:Will satisfy the Bard.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_3:1.0000:A duty here, devolves on me ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_4:0.9750:To undeceive the man ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_5:1.0000:Who, can't beyond the " body" see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_6:1.0000:Nor mind of others scan.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_7:1.0000:Mark ! full thirty years he labour' d hard ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_8:0.9750:Obtain'd by hands and head ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_9:1.0000:A full, a due, and just reward,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_10:1.0000:To have his " body fed."—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_11:1.0000:Then, left those men to labour still,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_12:1.0000:Who haven't done the same ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_13:1.0000:Because they're grinding at the " Mill,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_14:1.0000:Would fain transfer the blame !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_15:1.0000:A Partner he has had (to Wife,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_17:0.9750:With Children, five, to comfort life,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_18:0.9750:Alternate hopes and fears.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_19:0.9750:Two lovely sons have gone, before
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_20:0.9750:Their kindred, who remain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_21:1.0000:Trusting to meet them on " yon shore,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_22:1.0000:Never to part again.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_23:1.0000:For which his bounding heart is full,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_24:0.9500:Of gratitude to God ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_25:0.9750:Whose promise can't be void or null,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_26:0.9750:To those who watch his nod,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_27:1.0000:" Be diligent in business," then,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_28:0.9500:And fervent too, " in spirit,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_29:1.0000:To pay your way like honest men ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_30:0.9750:That you, " may good inherit."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_31:0.9750:I grant you this, that you may not —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0097_32:0.9500:Have carving-knife in hand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_4:0.9750:Contentment, with a firm resolve
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_5:1.0000:To do his sovereign will ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_6:0.9750:Intricacies can not involve
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_7:1.0000:The needle in the " drill."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_8:0.9750:Quick as the apple of an eye ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_9:1.0000:Susceptible of touch,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_10:0.9750:Ye soon shall know, the " reason why"—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_13:0.9750:Begone, ye keen " censorious folk,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_14:0.9500:Who'd mar the flower blown ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_15:1.0000:And in your neighbours garden walk ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_16:1.0000:But quite neglect your own ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_17:1.0000:My friend, I'd have you understand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_18:1.0000:As you have hands to work ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_19:1.0000:Plough well, " your own wee bit of land :"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_20:0.9500:And use both rake and fork.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_21:1.0000:Then, sow your seed, and watch, and pray,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_22:1.0000:Nor from your labour cease ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0098_24:0.9750:And granted the increase.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_4:0.9750:The Primrose by its side ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_5:1.0000:The faithful Lover only knows,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_6:1.0000:The beauty of his Bride.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_7:0.9500:The Morn is clear, the Sun shines bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_8:1.0000:And in the same we take delight ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_9:0.9500:But never for one moment wait,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_10:0.9750:The outside of the Garden-gate.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_11:1.0000:I'm now within the lovely Bower y
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_12:0.9500:Where all is harmony ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_13:0.9500:And nothing can my Standard low'r,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_17:0.9750:The Hawthorns blossom fair ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_18:1.0000:Here every Plant and Shrub renew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_19:0.9750:The sweet and balmy air.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_21:0.9500:While limpid streams do gently flow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_22:1.0000:Reviving is the breeze,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0099_23:1.0000:Which causes ev'ry plant to grow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_1:1.0000:Sweet Birds of Music tune their lays,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_2:1.0000:Symphonic style so grand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_3:1.0000:Methinks I live in golden days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_4:1.0000:With pleasure at command.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_6:0.9500:I'll pace along the verdant meads,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_7:1.0000:Where Zephyrs, charming play,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_9:0.9750:To drive dull care away.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_12:1.0000:With echo loud and clear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_13:0.9750:Which crowns my lovely rural Tale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_14:1.0000:The heart of man to cheer.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_17:0.9500:Of Paradise below ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_18:1.0000:And realize the happy state
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0100_19:0.9500:Of those who pious grow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_15:0.9500:With works that are in darkness done ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_16:0.9500:Uncleanness never do.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_19:1.0000:With variance, heresies, and guile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_20:0.9500:Ne'er let your wit be caught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_21:1.0000:Seditions, avarice, and strife,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_24:0.9500:And gender actions mean.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0101_26:0.9500:Of drunken rev'lings near ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_1:0.9750:Bring nothing less than woful pain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_2:1.0000:Distress, despair, and fear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_3:1.0000:Thefts, lies, and fornication base,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_4:1.0000:With every other evil,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_5:1.0000:Connected with the human race,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_6:1.0000:Do constitute the Devil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_7:1.0000:Thus, working in the heart of man ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_8:1.0000:By fleshly lust and pride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_9:1.0000:Ere since the period sin began ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_10:0.9750:Commencing with the " Bride."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_11:1.0000:The love of God ; within the heart
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_12:0.9750:Of man, has this effect —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_13:1.0000:" From every evil, now to part,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_14:1.0000:And Satan's wiles, reject.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_15:1.0000:Fruits of the holy Spirit, are ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_16:1.0000:Fair gentleness, and truth ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_18:0.9750:Nor guile found in his mouth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_19:1.0000:All goodness, love, and joy, and peace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_20:1.0000:Do flourish on the " tree" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_21:1.0000:Of holiness, which shall increase,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_22:1.0000:To all eternity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_23:1.0000:Meekness, and temp'rance, form a part
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_24:1.0000:Of that delicious fruit ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_25:1.0000:Which gladdens every sinner's heart :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_26:1.0000:And doth his strength recruit.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_27:1.0000:Only partake of Christ, and live —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_28:1.0000:By faith in Him below ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_30:0.9750:Which shall perpetual grow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0102_31:0.9750:Let not presumption make her boast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_5:1.0000:When he hath cast the evil out,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_6:0.9750:The fruits of " love we find."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_10:1.0000:In virtue of my Saviour's name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_11:1.0000:And to his glory burn.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_12:0.9750:Who planted in my breast the spark ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_13:1.0000:Which must for ever shine :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_14:1.0000:To shew the prize, and hit the mark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_16:0.9750:Where light, and life, and truth, and grace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_17:0.9750:Are wonderf'lly set forth ; —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_20:1.0000:Then follow him through life, to find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_21:1.0000:That unexampl'd love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_22:1.0000:Which cur'd the sick, and heal'd the blind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0103_23:0.9750:And did their sin remove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_2:0.9500:" Gethsemane come forth ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_3:1.0000:And prove the tears, my Saviour shed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_4:1.0000:Brought agony to birth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_5:1.0000:The tragic scene, the bloody sweat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_6:1.0000:The cross and passion there ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_8:1.0000:The streams of liquid prayer."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_9:1.0000:Fly then, to " Calv'ry's rugged mount"—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_10:1.0000:Behold him on the tree !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_11:1.0000:Arithmetic could never count,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_12:0.9500:The price of blood for me.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_14:0.9500:" All nature in convulse ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_15:1.0000:Nor can I write the " epopee ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_16:1.0000:My passions feel repulse.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_17:1.0000:The solid rocks in sunder rent —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_18:1.0000:Earth's strongest pillars bend ; '
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_19:0.9750:" Nature's support at this event,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_20:0.9500:Is human nature's friend."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_22:1.0000:The Moon in sable dress'd ;

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_24:0.9500:To mourn for the distress'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_25:0.9750:Hark ; how the groans (of him who said,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0104_27:1.0000:Tear up the graves, and raise the dead ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_4:1.0000:But what brings credit to thy name :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_12:1.0000:More manifest and clear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_13:1.0000:If " Scarbro' " beauties could be seen
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_14:1.0000:At this time of the year ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_15:1.0000:In what your duty does consist,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_16:1.0000:To me, or to your self ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_17:1.0000:I daren't presume, tho' you persist,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_18:1.0000:On "Christmas"' laden shelf;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_19:0.9500:Altho' you know the splendour of
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_21:1.0000:You write to me in terms of love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_22:1.0000:With garnish in your rhyme.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_23:1.0000:I know that you were on the spot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0105_24:1.0000:When I was tied so fast —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_1:0.9500:I cannot leave my humble Cot ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_2:1.0000:To face the wintry blast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_3:1.0000:For I am seated snug and warm
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_4:0.9750:Beside the man I love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_5:1.0000:And now repudiate the charm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_6:1.0000:Which calls me to remove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_7:1.0000:You wish me well, my Partner too j
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_9:1.0000:This compliment I pay to you ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_10:0.9750:All seasons of the year.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_11:1.0000:And if kind Providence permit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_12:1.0000:That we each other see ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_13:1.0000:Altho' I think it can't be yet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_14:0.9500:Till then, " remember me."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_17:1.0000:As well as that to me ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_18:1.0000:While in the month of cold December
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_19:0.9750:The sweets of summer see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_20:1.0000:And feel, and taste, that God is good ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_21:0.9500:For nothing less will do :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_22:1.0000:If duty in obedience stood ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_23:0.9750:The same to me as you.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_24:1.0000:But, can we doubt to meet again ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_25:1.0000:While we his laws obey ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_26:1.0000:Till then, may each in love remain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0106_27:1.0000:And so march on our way.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_6:0.9750:'Tis but a drop we now receive ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_7:0.9500:A prelude to the show'r,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_14:0.9750:And can it be, my blessed Lord ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_15:0.9750:Is the Millennial true ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_16:1.0000:According to thy written word,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_22:0.9750:My heart is full, pray do enlarge
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0107_23:1.0000:The vessel, more and more,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0108_16:1.0000:Propel the Barge along.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0108_21:0.9750:Wherein the humane are so artfully propping,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_4:1.0000:With pleasure thus, we study —

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_10:0.9750:Who often stand to gaze,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_11:0.9750:And listen to the voice of truth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_12:1.0000:Sounding their Author's praise !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_14:0.9750:Attracting ev'ry eye, —

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_18:0.9750:So beautiful and fair —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_19:1.0000:Thus, are we by her smiles caress'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_20:1.0000:Breathing the morning air !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_21:1.0000:Our senses are regal'd, as we
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_22:1.0000:Are climbing up the hills ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_23:1.0000:And every heart, is fill'd with glee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_24:0.9750:In echo to the rills ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_25:1.0000:Which glide along the crescent vale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_26:1.0000:In rippling accent sweet
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_27:0.9500:Each stanza tells the lovely tale
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0111_28:0.9750:That I shall now repeat. —

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_1:0.9750:Well, now what does it me behove :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_2:1.0000:To point the " pupil's" pen ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_3:1.0000:You've seen the tacitonia wove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_4:1.0000:Then, weave it o'er again.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_5:1.0000:And strive to moralize the same :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_6:1.0000:This subject is replete,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_7:1.0000:With language, I can never name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_8:1.0000:Or Gabriel's tongue repeat !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_9:1.0000:And yet, it speaks so plain, that all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_10:1.0000:Who hear may understand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_11:1.0000:And now, obey their Maker's call :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_12:1.0000:While each walk, hand in hand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_13:1.0000:The privileges you enjoy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_14:1.0000:Connected with this School —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_15:0.9750:Should stimulate each " Girl and Boy,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_16:1.0000:To work, the golden rule. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_17:0.9750:Whereby, to furnish heart and head,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_18:1.0000:With wisdom, (" not with pride,")
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_19:1.0000:And in her lovely steps be led
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_20:0.9500:To him, who did provide.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_24:0.9750:Against the Lord, with doubts and fears,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_25:1.0000:Caus'd Him His wrath to shew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0112_26:1.0000:Altho' the numerous actions kind,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_14:1.0000:Their way, through life on earth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_15:0.9500:The bearings of the Song are those,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_19:1.0000:And God commanded them to read
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_20:1.0000:The same, and oft repeat
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_21:0.9750:The Decalogue, unto their seed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_23:1.0000:And this shall witness to the fact.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_24:1.0000:Of statements, clear and just ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_29:1.0000:Whose failure at the waters seal'd —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0113_30:0.9500:His feet to Nebo's mount.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_1:1.0000:And heard the solemn, firm " command,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_2:1.0000:He shouldn't cross the flood.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_3:1.0000:His heart was pain'd within him, when
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_4:1.0000:He saw the lovely spot,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_5:1.0000:On which he'd " flourish'd with his pen,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_6:1.0000:And realiz'd it not.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_7:1.0000:For Moses here was doom'd to die,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_8:1.0000:The Mandate had gone forth ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_9:1.0000:He knew full well the reason, why
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_10:0.9750:His God with him was wroth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_11:1.0000:"Yet Jacob like," he urg'd his plea,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_12:1.0000:But couldn't so prevail ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_13:1.0000:As he had heard, so it must be ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_17:0.9750:(Said Moses,) but on no account —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_18:0.9500:Was alter'd the decree.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_19:1.0000:The answer came, " as heretofore,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_20:1.0000:Go up, and look around ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_21:1.0000:Nor plant thy foot on Canaan's shore :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_22:1.0000:Where earth's best fruits are found.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_23:1.0000:Let this suffice thee, speak no more,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_24:0.9750:By symbolizing fair ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_25:1.0000:For thou shall reap a better store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_26:1.0000:Than that enjoyment there.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_27:1.0000:So now, a long farewell he bid —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_28:0.9750:Adieu, to ev'ry tribe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_29:0.9750:The Lord his body surely hid ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_30:1.0000:For, " Moses was his scribe."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_31:0.9500:One hundred and twenty years liv'd
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0114_32:0.9500:This Pilgrim, in his day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_3:1.0000:While in good health, and strength, and might ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_4:0.9500:His Master call'd him hence :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_5:1.0000:Nor dim his eyes, ocular sight —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_7:1.0000:Who rose the tune, to sing the song,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_13:0.9500:He, in the wilderness had fed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_15:1.0000:And all their families preserv'd —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_20:1.0000:Moses, their friend was dead ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_21:0.9500:They mourn'd, and wept, " because the Tree,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_22:0.9750:Had ceas'd to grow them bread.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_24:0.9500:That when he has his sight ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_25:0.9500:He cannot see to honor much,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_28:0.9750:He then begins to see ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_29:1.0000:And thus affects to sigh, and mourn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_30:0.9500:O'er what can never be.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0115_31:0.9750:He's gone, " say they," he's gone, but where ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_4:1.0000:To guard the dust around ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_5:1.0000:Until the Judge of all, commands,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_6:1.0000:The trump of God to sound.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_7:1.0000:Then, " rise ye dead ;" is issu'd forth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_14:1.0000:'"'' And give a just account,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_15:0.9500:Of all your Mythologic gear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_16:0.9750:And tell me the amount ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_17:1.0000:The truth I want, and nothing more ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_18:0.9500:That all mankind may know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_19:0.9750:What is your ammunitive store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_23:1.0000:To make of man a juicy bite ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0116_24:0.9750:And fill his veins with poisonous stuff,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_3:0.9750:Who trust to heathen Gods, their might,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_4:1.0000:Will cut and slay with great delight ;

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_6:1.0000:The Devil catches fruit, and all,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_7:1.0000:Within his bag, and strange to tell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_8:1.0000:Conducts them to his native Hell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_9:1.0000:Where all his vot' ries reunite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_10:0.9750:In worse than Mythologic night ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_11:0.9750:Deep sunk, to pay their awful score,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_12:1.0000:With feigns tormented, evermore !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_15:0.9500:So splendid in the East !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0117_17:0.9750:With vot' ries to the feast.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_2:1.0000:Nor war, or discord there :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_3:0.9750:The Prince who merits all esteem,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_4:1.0000:Of all things, is the heir !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_5:1.0000:To whose fair bride, he does bequeath
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_6:1.0000:An everlasting store !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_7:1.0000:A dowry, while on earth beneath,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_9:1.0000:Far, far above all mortal ken,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_10:1.0000:See thrones and kingdoms fall !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_11:1.0000:Where saints, and angels joining then,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_19:0.9750:And now we welcome in the morn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_20:1.0000:Which brought the lovely " Gem ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_21:1.0000:Into this darksome world of ours,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_22:1.0000:To dwell, and radiate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0118_24:1.0000:Of Adam's lost estate.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_2:1.0000:The captain of the train !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_3:1.0000:Which shall in all succeeding years,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_4:1.0000:Their Paradise regain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_5:0.9750:In bliss extatic now rejoice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_6:1.0000:Behold his lovely face !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_7:0.9500:And hear the charming halcyon voice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_8:1.0000:Of our Redeemer's grace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_11:1.0000:The Heir of all things now hath giv'n,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_12:0.9750:Captives a full release.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_13:0.9750:These joyful tidings each may sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_14:0.9750:" Salvation to the Lamb !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_15:1.0000:Who did to us the message bring.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_16:1.0000:From God, " the Great I Am !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_17:1.0000:A stable was His lodging made
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_18:1.0000:A manger was His bed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_19:1.0000:The brightest " Gem" while in the shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_20:1.0000:A life of suff'ring led ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_21:1.0000:By whose kind visit to our world,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0119_23:1.0000:And now the secret is unfurl'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_5:1.0000:The vital spark still onward goes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_6:1.0000:To bask in blissful day
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_8:1.0000:Dispelling gloomy night ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_9:1.0000:The mind soars high, on splendid themes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_12:1.0000:Themselves, while he can stand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_17:1.0000:Whose word is power, and surely will
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_19:1.0000:Far, far away, from troubles then,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_20:1.0000:His happy soul shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_21:0.9750:Beyond the reach of mortal ken,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0120_22:0.9500:Bless' d to eternity !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_1:0.9750:And now, the Day-Spring from on high,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_2:1.0000:Shines forth in grand display ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_3:1.0000:From Pisgah's mount our wings apply,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_5:1.0000:On Faith's strong pinions, far heyond
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_6:1.0000:What eye hath ever seen ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_7:1.0000:The " Prospect" is in Canaan found,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_16:1.0000:To test the productions of man.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_17:1.0000:Full liberty's granted that each may come forth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_19:1.0000:Whereby the connoisseurs may prove their true worth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_20:0.9500:When plac'd in a comical drill.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_21:1.0000:Vast machinery bright to lessen the toil
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_22:0.9750:Of man, with his physical powers,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_23:1.0000:Who inclining to bend by the tilling of soil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0121_24:1.0000:Humanity cries it is ours.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_1:1.0000:The genius starts up in a turbulent rage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_2:0.9750:And pities the labouring class,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_3:1.0000:Who have long stood aloof tho' now do engage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_4:1.0000:That jewels be made out of brass.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_5:1.0000:The Aristocrats know the value of such
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_6:1.0000:As strive for the weal of mankind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_7:1.0000:United are they, and intend to do much,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_8:1.0000:For those who their genius can find.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_9:0.9750:Then bring to the City of fair London town,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_10:1.0000:The product of which must appear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_11:1.0000:In the midst of Hyde-Park, where all's to be shown,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_12:1.0000:So splendid in spring of the year.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_13:1.0000:What a business is now going on to prepare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_14:0.9500:The City is all agitation ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_15:1.0000:No time, or expense, nor trouble they spare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_16:0.9500:To own and esteem their relation.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_17:1.0000:Expecting the same to come forth in the March ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_18:0.9750:Astonish'd this sight to behold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_19:1.0000:Who for centuries back have been in the search
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_20:0.9750:Of genius more valu'd than gold.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_21:1.0000:All Nations forsooth ; contribute their mite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_22:0.9500:Of whatever climate or class,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_23:1.0000:Major, or Minor, each one has a right
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_24:1.0000:To come and mix up in the mass.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_25:1.0000:No distinctions are made to lessen the worth
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_26:0.9750:Of any bright genius of art ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_31:0.9750:Who join in the chorus, wield sceptre aright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0122_32:0.9500:All Nations are come to the " Fair."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_2:0.9750:No jar in the sentiment here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_3:0.9500:Protentions of unity, peace, and of love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_5:1.0000:In accordance is this with the Scriptural plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_6:1.0000:Laid down in a beautiful form ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_7:1.0000:Patronizing the same each acting as man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_8:0.9750:To drive off the bitterest storm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_9:1.0000:Let all then unite with intellect bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_10:0.9750:And bring the product to the test ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_11:1.0000:Being fill'd with delight, no Nation to fight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_12:0.9500:Promotion of peace, is the best.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_13:1.0000:The spirit of love and of good-will to man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_14:0.9750:Breathes in the most splendid array ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_15:0.9750:While Princes and subjects do all that they can,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_16:1.0000:To collect the sweet flowers in " May."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_17:1.0000:No equivocation starts up in the breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_18:1.0000:To quell, or to drive away peace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_19:1.0000:Grand policy this is, when brought to the test,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_20:0.9750:All war, and commotion shall cease.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_21:1.0000:One talent or more to each man is given,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_22:0.9500:Hereby to improve the whole " race ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_23:0.9500:Small portions of balm the " masses" will leaven,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_24:0.9500:While working so snug in its place.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_25:1.0000:Good feeling now rests in " Victoria's" reign,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_26:0.9750:Wherever her subjects are planted,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_27:0.9750:The leaves of all Nations resplendently green,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_28:1.0000:Exhibit the fruit so much wanted.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_31:0.9750:As nothing that grows was designed to waste,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0123_32:0.9500:By him who created " man," sober.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_2:0.9500:Equitorial touch, " is the line ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_6:0.9500:jong time ago as I have read*
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_7:1.0000:This story, false or true —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_8:1.0000:That rats and mice can not be fed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_9:1.0000:In empty Church or pew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_10:1.0000:But, lo ! 'twas in a Chapel, where
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_11:1.0000:This circumstance took place.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_12:1.0000:Which I have traced out with care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_13:1.0000:Altho' in mimic grace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_14:1.0000:A Caledonian lodg'd awhile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_15:1.0000:As resident below ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_16:1.0000:Without the vacant laugh or smile.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_17:1.0000:Within an old Chateaul
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_18:1.0000:Here, nightly visits he had paid,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_19:1.0000:While on his Couch, or Bed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_20:1.0000:Trembling and quaking, much afraid,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_21:1.0000:Of rumblings o'er his head.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_22:1.0000:While something rolled to and fro,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_23:0.9750:In consternation, he
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_24:1.0000:Durst never rise, or thither go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0124_25:1.0000:His visitor to see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_1:0.9750:Until the Ghost was weary, quite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_2:0.9750:Of its rotary march,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_3:1.0000:And hunger brought the thing to light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_4:1.0000:Which prov'd a glob'lar arch.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_5:1.0000:Or vacant, nausea, human skull,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_6:0.9750:Wherein a rat had crept,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_7:1.0000:To get its empty belly full :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_8:0.9750:So there it laid and slept.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_9:1.0000:Until at length it grew so stout
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_10:0.9750:And bulky, in its cell —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_11:1.0000:Nor could it when it would, get out,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_12:0.9750:Altho' it rang the bell.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_13:1.0000:Or, roll'd the crusty house along,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_14:0.9500:This ancient Castle floor ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_15:0.9750:Night after night the Ghost was throng
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_16:1.0000:Seeking the passage door.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_17:1.0000:This strange phenomena went on
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_18:1.0000:For length of time, till lo !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_19:1.0000:The barguest, when his meat was gone,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_21:1.0000:Methinks I see him peeping through
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_22:1.0000:The hollow of each eye —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_23:1.0000:Whose ship had neither stern, nor bow, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_24:0.9750:He'd drank the Ocean dry.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_25:1.0000:Then did he sail in empty boat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_26:1.0000:Without provision too —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_27:1.0000:The cargo in himself afloat ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_28:0.9750:Not knowing what to do.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_29:0.9750:He mov'd the vessel to and fro,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0125_31:0.9750:Nor could he steer, or even row,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_1:1.0000:The brute was now confin'd within
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_2:1.0000:This round and crusty fort ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_3:1.0000:Until his body grew so thin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_4:1.0000:Which ended all his sport.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_5:1.0000:At length he spied the entrance door,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_7:1.0000:To steal the brains, and something more,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_8:1.0000:Which brought him out with fame.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_9:1.0000:The Caledonian mark'd his way,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_10:1.0000:When he ran off with speed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_11:1.0000:Who just had found the free man's day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_12:1.0000:As you may judge who read.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_13:1.0000:The empty head was all that he,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_15:0.9750:Who long had heard, but couldn't see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_16:0.9750:When reason's eye was blind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_17:1.0000:Astonish' d he should be afraid !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_18:1.0000:Whole nights he got no rest ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_19:1.0000:The spirit of the Ghost is laid,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_20:1.0000:The rat had caus'd the jest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0126_23:0.9750:The soul's unnerv'd, and reason's blind."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_5:1.0000:And mar your sweetest pleasure.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_6:1.0000:The mind of man is often toss'd
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_7:0.9750:About in fancy fair ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_8:1.0000:Nor can he know the penal cost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_9:1.0000:Till found by want and care.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_10:1.0000:Let anchor to the mind be fix'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_11:1.0000:Watch well, " the ebb and flow ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_12:1.0000:Nor have it to the bow annex' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_13:1.0000:When it should be below.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_14:1.0000:Behold, the youth in grandeur clad,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_15:1.0000:When first he started off;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_16:1.0000:Plenty of every thing he had,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_17:1.0000:And all, was not enough.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_18:0.9750:But fancy says, " thou should have this ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_19:0.9750:(Remember thou art free,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_20:1.0000:For want of which, thy mates will hiss—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_22:1.0000:He lifts his head, and looks in style,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_23:1.0000:Altho' he's apt to yield ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_24:1.0000:Caught by hypocrisy and guile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0127_25:0.9750:His destiny is seal'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_1:1.0000:Who listens to the tempting jilt,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_2:1.0000:With her bewitching smile ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_3:1.0000:Will find himself immers'd in guilt,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_4:1.0000:When he reflects awhile.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_5:0.9750:But, shortly and those rubs go o'er,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_6:1.0000:Which conscience pointed clear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_7:1.0000:He posts along, " looks back no more,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_8:1.0000:Till finish' d his career.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_9:1.0000:Now you perceive the haggard look,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_10:1.0000:He never had before —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_11:0.9750:Reflection's privilege forsook,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_12:1.0000:And shut her to the door.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_13:1.0000:Thus, Nature in her tatter' d form,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_14:1.0000:Forlorn in dissipation ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_15:0.9750:Renders the calm a mighty storm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_16:0.9750:And seals his destination.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_17:1.0000:Ah, me ! and is reflection lost ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_18:1.0000:Nor can she more be found ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_19:1.0000:Unless it be, " at peace's cost" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_20:1.0000:In chains of iron, bound.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_21:0.9750:And then, " Dives" like, reflect in vain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_22:1.0000:And offer up thy prayer —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_23:1.0000:But never, never to obtain
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_25:1.0000:The door is shut, the gulf is fix'd !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_26:1.0000:No passage, to or fro !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_27:1.0000:The penalty is now annex'd —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0128_28:0.9500:And whither shalt thou go ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_4:0.9750:The thirsty Earth soaks up the rain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_5:1.0000:And drinks, and gapes for drink again.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_6:1.0000:The Plants suck in the Earth, and are
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_7:1.0000:By constant drinking, fresh and fair :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_8:0.9750:The Sea itself, which one would think
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_9:1.0000:Should have but little need of drink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_11:1.0000:So fill'd, that they o'erflow the cup.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_12:0.9750:The busy Sun, and one would guess
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_13:1.0000:By's drunken, fiery face no less,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_14:0.9750:Drinks up the Sea, and when he's done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_16:1.0000:They drink and dance by their own light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_17:1.0000:They drink aiad revel all the night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_18:1.0000:Nothing in Nature's sober found,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_19:1.0000:But an eternal health goes round.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_20:0.9750:Fill up the Bowl then, fill it high ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_21:0.9750:Fill up the Glasses there ; for why
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_22:1.0000:Should every Creature drink but I ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0129_23:0.9750:Why, Man of Mortals, tell me why ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_7:0.9750:But this, mankind do surely know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_8:1.0000:The way that Drunkard's have to go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_9:0.9500:At death, have got their final blow !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_13:0.9750:Mark, while the lamp of life shall burn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_14:1.0000:The drunken rebel may return !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_15:0.9750:And all the best of lessons learn,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_18:1.0000:But, when the oil of life is spent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_19:1.0000:And that of grace, " you can't repent !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0130_24:1.0000:And did he not all things provide ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_1:1.0000:While trav'ling in this world below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_2:0.9750:You'd rather to Gin-palace go :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_3:0.9750:And drink, and stagger to and fro,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_8:1.0000:Who'd strip you nak'd from head to feet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_9:1.0000:And turn you so, into the street :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_12:1.0000:On Nature's vicious habits feast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_17:1.0000:Presumptive Man, and dare you say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_18:1.0000:You'll revel still, from day to day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_19:0.9750:You have but Nature's debt to pay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_22:1.0000:To whom, submission you must yield,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_23:0.9750:Your doom and destiny are seal'd ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_27:0.9750:Remember " Dives," and where he lies !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_28:1.0000:In hell, he lifted up his eyes ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0131_29:1.0000:And loudly now, for water cries,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_7:1.0000:Ye men of wit, and common sense,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_8:0.9500:With inebriety dispense —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_12:1.0000:To act subservient to their King :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_13:0.9750:That all, may to his glory sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_18:1.0000:If I can save a single worm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_19:0.9750:From perishing amid the storm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_22:1.0000:And ah ! who wouldn't this desire !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0132_23:1.0000:And work, till he the same acquire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_4:0.9750:Till he could hardly see —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_5:1.0000:Yet, darkness he prefer' d to light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_6:1.0000:And revel' d in it, day and night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_7:0.9750:With heart quite full of glee !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_8:1.0000:He strives to justify his deeds ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_9:1.0000:While sowing base, ungodly seeds,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_10:1.0000:With which he fills his bowl.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_11:1.0000:And then, drinks in the liquid fire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_12:1.0000:So pregnant with destructive ire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_13:1.0000:To damn his very soul !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_14:1.0000:" What should I do but drink away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_15:1.0000:The heat and trouble of the day ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_16:1.0000:I'm in a kingly state !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_17:1.0000:And thus, will always take my fill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_18:1.0000:Till all the wheels of life are still,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_19:1.0000:My courage won't abate."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_20:1.0000:We'll grant him then, his hearts desire ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_21:0.9750:(Which Nature never did require,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_22:1.0000:To drink his poisonous stuff;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_23:1.0000:And now, he wallows like a beast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_24:1.0000:On carnal passions, thus to feast —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0133_25:0.9750:But never has enough !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_1:1.0000:Until he drops beneath his load,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_2:1.0000:Where friends, no help can him afford,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_3:0.9750:He stretches, swells, and dies :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_4:0.9750:Then, earth, receives her own again ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_5:1.0000:Which, as he says, " drinks in the rain"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_6:1.0000:But now she's got a prize !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_7:0.9750:Whereon to feast, and worms withal !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_8:1.0000:Do revel here, and on him crawl,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_9:1.0000:Who did to " Bacchus bow,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_10:1.0000:He drank the cup, unto its dregs,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_11:1.0000:Empti'd big barrels, and wee kegs !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_12:1.0000:What says the drinker now ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_13:0.9750:" The thirsty earth soaks up the rain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_14:1.0000:She drinks, and gapes for drink again ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_15:1.0000:And never, never done" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_16:1.0000:Had he drank water like the earth :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_17:1.0000:Good things, he might have brought to birth
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_18:0.9750:Matured by the sun —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_19:1.0000:As plants suck in the soil, and are
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_20:1.0000:By constant drinking, fresh and fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_21:1.0000:So man, should drink, and live !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_22:1.0000:In sober habits all his days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_23:1.0000:And sound the great Creator's praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_24:0.9750:Who, earth to him did give.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_25:1.0000:" And, tho' the sea, (as you may think)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_26:0.9750:Would have but little need to drink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_27:0.9750:Ten thousand rivers up ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_28:0.9750:But hark, what use she makes of such,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0134_29:1.0000:Who, never, never gets too much —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_1:1.0000:The earth is water' d by the sea ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_2:1.0000:And every shrub, and plant, and tree,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_3:1.0000:Receive their suction thence —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_4:1.0000:Drawn by the Sun's attractive power,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_5:1.0000:Which tinges every leaf and flower ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_6:0.9750:Sweet odours to dispense —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_8:0.9750:May travel far with boirow'd light ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_9:0.9750:In luminous display !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_10:1.0000:Yet, sober, they do brilliant shine —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_11:0.9750:And speak their origin, divine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_14:0.9500:And make th' infernal regions ring !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_15:1.0000:"With strumpets, and with wine. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_16:0.9750:But, never can they harmonize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_17:0.9500:The regions of the upper skies !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_18:1.0000:Nor, to their credit shine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_19:1.0000:These votaries of pleasure may
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_20:1.0000:Here, revel all their life short day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_21:1.0000:In what they call delight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_22:1.0000:With mad'ning drink, and Lady fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_23:1.0000:By dissipation lull their care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_24:1.0000:And drown their senses quite !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_25:1.0000:But, tell me not, ye rev'ling tribe,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_26:0.9750:That you, can truth, and justice bribe,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_27:1.0000:Then die, and all is o'er !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_28:1.0000:For by the deeds, which you have done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_29:1.0000:In time, the race is lost, or won :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0135_30:1.0000:You have to pay your score.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_1:0.9750:By vicious habits, done your worst,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_2:1.0000:To recommend what God hath curst
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_3:1.0000:A Bacchanalian set !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_4:1.0000:Who, once were juicy, now are dry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_5:1.0000:And loudly for some water cry !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_6:1.0000:Which you can never get. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_7:1.0000:Baleful examples, you have left ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_8:1.0000:But now of time are quite bereft :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_9:1.0000:And bitterly may rue !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_10:1.0000:So I must tear your language up,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_11:1.0000:And recommend a better cup,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_12:1.0000:Than " Bacchus" ever knew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_17:1.0000:In vale, or on the mount,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_18:1.0000:And shall this throbbing pulse of mine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_19:1.0000:Retort in tacit tone ? —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_20:1.0000:What thou hast said of these, is thine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_21:1.0000:Where beauty's image shone.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_22:1.0000:Which does, and will, and shall at length
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_23:0.9750:Find nothing in one stay :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0136_24:1.0000:For man, with all his boasted strength,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_1:0.9500:Then, Nature shall enjoy a peace
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_2:1.0000:She never felt before,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_3:1.0000:When tabernacles all shall cease
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_4:1.0000:And fall to rise no more. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_5:1.0000:This is the province of old time,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_6:1.0000:Altho' it has been young ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_7:1.0000:Could never yet the mountain climb.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_8:0.9750:To sing its final song.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_9:0.9750:Pulsations from the heart arise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_10:0.9750:With every active spring ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_11:1.0000:A fountain to the whole implies,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_13:0.9750:Who, only can the Sea divide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_15:0.9750:Accelerate, or stem the tide
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_16:0.9750:Where morbid thought is drown' d.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_17:1.0000:Of ancient times, the present speak,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_18:1.0000:And some admire the same ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_19:1.0000:Altho' they do for ages seek
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_20:0.9750:Can only find the name.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_21:1.0000:Yet, good example always tells !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_22:1.0000:And sounds her lovely tale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_23:1.0000:As music from the village bells,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_24:1.0000:Vibrates throughout the vale.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_25:1.0000:The splendid halo stretching far,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_28:1.0000:To gild our hemisphere !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_29:1.0000:Can thought, than time more rapid leap
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_30:0.9750:Beyond the bound' ry gate :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0137_32:0.9500:Present, or pristine state ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_1:0.9500:Yet two extremes of ancient cast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_2:1.0000:Do with the present blend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_3:1.0000:In whose fair power is holden fast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_4:1.0000:What time can never end.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_5:1.0000:The soul of man created, by
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_7:1.0000:Can never, never, never die ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_12:0.9750:What afterwards you shall enjoy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_13:1.0000:The fruit of your labour and pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_14:1.0000:Make hay while the sun shines, my Man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_15:1.0000:Or you never may witness the day —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_16:1.0000:Strive afterwards all that you can,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_17:1.0000:To make, and secure your hay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_19:1.0000:Rake well now, and stir it about ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_20:1.0000:Nor suffer one season to pass,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_21:1.0000:Not adding a thread to your suit.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_22:0.9500:Make hay while the sun shines, dear Madam,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_23:1.0000:Look after, and manage your flock,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_24:0.9750:Remember your loss was in Adam !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0138_25:1.0000:Your gain is in Abraham's stock.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_1:0.9500:Make hay while the sun shines, good folk,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_2:1.0000:And then you will not have to rue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_3:1.0000:The spending your time in small talk ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_4:1.0000:A blast at the mouth of the flue.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_5:1.0000:Make hay while the sun shines, on you !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_6:1.0000:Who have but a short day to work ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_7:1.0000:Methinks you may know what to do,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_8:1.0000:Respecting the rake and the fork.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_10:0.9750:When blackness and darkness appear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_11:1.0000:The loiterer then is distress' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_12:1.0000:Having lost the sunshine of the year.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_13:0.9750:"Our life is a short winter's day,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_14:1.0000:Or a bright summer's morning at best,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_15:1.0000:Wherewith, we shall soon pass away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_16:1.0000:As a bird that has flown from its nest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_17:1.0000:" Our life is a short winter's day !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_18:1.0000:Repeat it again, " my dear Boy,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_19:1.0000:Attend now, to what I shall say —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_20:0.9750:Improvement will never destroy.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_21:1.0000:Our Seasons are gloomy, and bright
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_22:1.0000:Alternate, with heat, and with cold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_23:1.0000:Tho' youth may be fill'd with delight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_24:0.9750:Reverse it may be, when they're old.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_25:0.9750:Make hay while the sun shines, (I say,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_26:1.0000:'Twill soon be o'er-shaded with gloom,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_27:1.0000:Be up and be doing to-day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0139_28:0.9750:To-morrow may settle your doom.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_3:0.9750:To which we are hast'ning along,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_4:1.0000:The rich man, the honest, and brave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_5:1.0000:Alike, test the truth of my song.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_6:0.9750:Remember the subject I've given !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_9:0.9750:You never can work them o'er twice.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_10:1.0000:Provide while you can, for a storm !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_11:0.9500:The clouds are now low'ring for rain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_13:1.0000:A harbour you then shall obtain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_14:0.9750:Such a beautiful morning is seen,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_15:0.9750:All nature is splendid and gay —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_16:1.0000:The high vaulted sky is serene !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_17:0.9500:December 's as pleasant as May.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_18:1.0000:For the life that now is, and to come,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_19:1.0000:Remember " the making of hay" —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_20:1.0000:While the light of the sun shines at home ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_25:0.9750:For things which cannot need you there,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0140_26:0.9500:Time useless thus to spend.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_1:1.0000:For nothing therefore careful be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_3:1.0000:The lot of each, by land or sea,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_4:0.9750:At which frail man repines.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_5:1.0000:Yet, use all care and vigilance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_6:0.9750:Where truth and virtue blends,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_7:1.0000:With int'rest in the moral scene,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_8:0.9500:And answers well two ends.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_9:1.0000:The welfare of mankind in this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_10:1.0000:And in the world to come ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_11:1.0000:Hereby you'll find no care amiss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_16:1.0000:Then every act of life shall tend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_17:1.0000:To mend, of make his coat.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_18:1.0000:No merit to this work I claim,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_19:1.0000:Or patronage solicit ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_20:1.0000:Altho' I do insert my name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_21:0.9750:In language so explicit.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_22:0.9750:A rule or two, I will suggest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_23:1.0000:To those who love to read ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_24:1.0000:First, of all matter, cull the best,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0141_25:0.9750:On which your minds to feed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_2:0.9750:And cast away the wrong ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_3:1.0000:By this you shall improvement gain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_4:1.0000:And music in your song.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_5:1.0000:Next, have the pointer in its place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_6:1.0000:Which tells the time of day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_7:1.0000:In virtue shew an honest face,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_8:1.0000:And always pay your way.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_9:1.0000:No need for me to speak a word
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_10:1.0000:Beyond what you have seen ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_11:1.0000:To waste our time we can't afford,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_12:0.9500:You know, the truth I mean.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_17:1.0000:And sound the joyous tidings, " all is well."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_18:1.0000:The orb of day dispels the gloom of night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_19:1.0000:And casts his brilliant orient beams around,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_20:1.0000:Where all was dreary, now the prospect bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_21:1.0000:Re-animates the soul in darkness bound.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_22:1.0000:As when from chaos leaping, Sol arose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_23:1.0000:And Nature smil'd to see the lovely morn ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0142_25:1.0000:Their sapient beauty, with creation born.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_1:0.9750:Thus, each spectator tunes the tacit string,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_2:0.9750:To sound in grateful notes their Author's praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_3:0.9750:Sweet melodies, the birds of music sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_4:1.0000:Sonorous to the Ancient-eer of days.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_5:1.0000:So man, in full accordance with the light,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_6:1.0000:Must rise and shine, in yon benighted land,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_7:1.0000:Where darkness still prevails, in heathen night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_8:1.0000:With hostile prowess of an Indian band —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_9:0.9500:Beyond the Ganges, where the mind is lost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_10:1.0000:In superstitious pomp, and potent pride ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_12:0.9750:Their infant children, to the flowing tide !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_13:1.0000:In shameful ignorance, and cruel power
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_14:1.0000:Of Legislators in yon foreign land,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_15:1.0000:All this is done, their offspring to devour,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_16:1.0000:While Parents on the banks with horror stand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_17:0.9750:Who, " told that Babes a sweet elysium find,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_20:1.0000:Need all instruction, from the good and wise —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_22:0.9750:Dense darkness then envelop'd all mankind !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_24:1.0000:And gave us eyes to see, who once were blind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_25:1.0000:With healing in his wings he nobly rides,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_26:1.0000:Majestic round the world, the whole to save,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_27:1.0000:From sin, and Satan, where no sea divides
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_28:0.9750:The Ethiopean, or the meanest slave. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_29:1.0000:His goodness, mercy, truth, and light, divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0143_32:0.9750:Within the portals of each sinner's heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_1:1.0000:Then ev'ry tongue shall sound in joyful lays,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_2:0.9750:The lovely Anthem, form'd by Christ alone!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_3:1.0000:To whom be all the honour, pow'r, and praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_7:0.9500:M!^p England's greatness do depend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_8:0.9500:Upon this sacred plan !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_9:0.9500:(Which cloth her rights in truth defend,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_10:0.9750:" Peace and good-will to man !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_11:1.0000:Then, is it manifest and clear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_13:1.0000:In peace, that each succeeding year,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_14:1.0000:Reviv'd all kinds of trade !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_15:0.9750:The march of intellect hath run,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_16:1.0000:(As it ne'er ran before !)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_17:1.0000:Without the bayonet or the gun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_18:0.9750:Increasing all our store !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_19:1.0000:Yea, mental, moral, and finance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_20:1.0000:Beyond all mortal ken !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_21:1.0000:Which proves that peace doth yet enhance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_22:0.9500:The dignity of men. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_23:1.0000:Witness the hostile parties then !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_25:1.0000:Acting their part, I trust as men,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_26:0.9750:After their author's mind. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0144_27:1.0000:The Devil, seems to be let loose !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_1:0.9500:Thus, to protect, and guard their house,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_2:0.9500:Against the " Amorite."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_3:0.9750:Then, knock old Satan's trammels off,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_4:1.0000:No more shall he devour ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_5:1.0000:Who reign'd so long in Malakoff,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_6:1.0000:And huilt the gothic tower ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_7:1.0000:To fall at last, as Babel must,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_8:1.0000:That every soul be free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_9:1.0000:For God, the only wise, and just,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_10:1.0000:Shall reign eternally ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_11:1.0000:Then, we shall ascertain, and prove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_12:0.9750:The strongest power given,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_13:0.9750:Is peace, and harmony, in love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_14:1.0000:The weapon us'd by heaven !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_15:1.0000:Which must ere long, o'er come the rage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_16:1.0000:The human breast contains ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_17:1.0000:To hasten on the golden age,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_18:1.0000:When nought but love remains ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_19:1.0000:Altho' the world is wondrous wide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_20:1.0000:With various turn of mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_21:1.0000:Yet, Britons, stem the strongest tide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_22:0.9750:Fell ignorance to find.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_23:1.0000:Then, sending out the word of life !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_24:0.9750:To every foreign land ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_25:1.0000:To put an end to mortal strife,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_26:0.9750:With Bible in their hand ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_27:1.0000:Much better than the sword, for sure ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_28:0.9500:No more to cut and slay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_29:1.0000:The people whom they cannot cure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_30:0.9500:But, by the gospel way.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0145_31:0.9750:Yet, if in love we're bound to go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_2:1.0000:To lay the latent rebel low,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_3:1.0000:That war and discord cease !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_4:0.9750:Then, shall the God of Israel stand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_5:1.0000:In front, and in the rear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_6:1.0000:With all our armies at command,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_7:1.0000:The British navy steer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_8:1.0000:Into the heathen's dark domain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_9:1.0000:Where cruelty prevails ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_10:0.9750:That truth, and righteousness obtain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_11:1.0000:Spread out your gallant sails !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_12:0.9750:And catch the heavenly breezes fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_13:1.0000:With virtue's golden pen !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_14:0.9750:To have all Nations under care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_15:1.0000:Of honest, Christian men.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_16:1.0000:Then shall the sun 'mid darkness shine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_17:0.9500:The Ethiop must be free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_18:1.0000:And every soul of man combine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_19:0.9750:To graft the Olive tree.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_20:0.9750:This conquest o'er the latent foe,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_21:0.9750:In Holy writ we read,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_22:1.0000:The period is predicted, tho'
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_25:0.9750:And every tide convey
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_26:1.0000:Good tidings, by the hand supreme,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0146_27:0.9500:Then, peace shall win the day ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_5:1.0000:The author felt, (for public weal,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_7:1.0000:No doubt has he upon his mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_8:0.9750:But those who read aright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_9:1.0000:Will many a pleasing subject find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_10:0.9750:To render them delight.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_11:1.0000:Those precious moments can't be lost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_12:1.0000:Wherein the same were wrote ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_13:1.0000:For never, since the very first,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_14:1.0000:Have they been spent for naught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_15:1.0000:This noble work detach' d him, from
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_16:0.9750:All bustle, care, and strife,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_17:0.9750:Which do detract one half the sum
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_18:1.0000:Of comfort, while in life,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_19:1.0000:Where din of politics, and noise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_20:1.0000:Of folly in their train ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_21:0.9750:Disturb the mind in equipoise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_22:1.0000:Creating grievous pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_23:0.9500:Vexatious vanity in these,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_24:0.9500:Hath fled before his eyes ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_25:1.0000:Nor shall he ever pay their fees,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_26:1.0000:In labouring to be wise.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_27:1.0000:Care and disquietude ne'er come,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_28:1.0000:Into his dwelling now,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_29:0.9750:Who sits in solitude at home,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0147_30:0.9500:Where peace and plenty grow !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_1:1.0000:Fresh in the morning rise and sing !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_2:1.0000:The pleasing task renew ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_3:1.0000:And mount as does the Lark on wing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_4:1.0000:Her labours to pursue.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_5:1.0000:And then your bus'ness all divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_6:1.0000:Delights the noble soul !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_7:1.0000:Thus, in your Maker's Image shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_8:1.0000:While endless ages roll !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_9:1.0000:But, ah ! " say you," we cannot get
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_10:1.0000:Our living by the same ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_11:1.0000:We have to toil, both dry and wet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_12:1.0000:To play the honest game.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_13:1.0000:All right, and still I must contend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_14:1.0000:For what I've said before ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_15:0.9750:Home int'rests, we should ever blend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_16:1.0000:With common wealth in store.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_17:1.0000:Allow me now to sit and sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_18:1.0000:This subject in recluse ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_19:1.0000:-■That you may have the very thing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_20:0.9750:And not yourself abuse.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_21:1.0000:Yes, yes, " say you," if we can raise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_22:0.9750:The wind, to bring a calm :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_23:1.0000:Then, we may spend some happy days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_24:1.0000:With little self alarm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_25:1.0000:And let vexation fly away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_27:0.9750:And realize the blessed day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_28:0.9500:Which cheers the human heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_29:0.9750:This day my friend, is just at hand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_30:0.9500:And now within your reach ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_31:0.9500:Lay hold, you have it at command
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0148_32:1.0000:Without a single breach. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_3:0.9750:And yet, 'tis every where !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_4:1.0000:For all may have it, more or less,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_5:1.0000:And none have ought to spare.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_6:1.0000:Such happiness is sure to be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_7:1.0000:The lot of those, who will
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_8:1.0000:With truth and equity agree,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_9:0.9750:And virtue's laws fulfil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_10:1.0000:We cannot buy the boon, 'tis free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_11:1.0000:For Jesu's precious sake :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_12:1.0000:Who purchas'd it, upon the tree !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_16:0.9750:Who liv'd in modern times ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_17:1.0000:And made Parnassus' bubbles stir,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_18:1.0000:By penning simple rhymes.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_19:1.0000:His neighbours rais'd the wonder, how,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_20:1.0000:And where he got his bread !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_21:1.0000:As so much time he did bestow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_22:0.9500:To have the Muses fed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_23:1.0000:Up came Inquisitoria bold,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_25:1.0000:If chance on truth he could lay hold.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0149_26:1.0000:His noddle-pin to trim !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_3:0.9500:Your head, your bread commands !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_4:1.0000:I cannot tell, sir, how you do !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_5:1.0000:And no one understands."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_6:1.0000:According as the curious ask,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_8:1.0000:Thus, with an answer, drew the mask,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_9:0.9750:Which hung before his eyes.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_10:0.9750:" Methinks, that if your hands and head
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_11:0.9750:"Were rightly us'd together,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_12:1.0000:You'd then provide your daily bread,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_13:0.9750:In calm, for stormy weather."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_14:0.9750:" Well, well," said he, " but I've enough
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_15:1.0000:To do, to get my bread ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_16:1.0000:Together with all useful stuff,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_17:1.0000:And use, both hands and head !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_18:1.0000:" I make no doubt of that my man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_19:0.9750:So much you seem to need ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_20:0.9750:Your looks present you weak and wan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_21:0.9750:With time, you cannot speed !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_23:1.0000:What I have got in hand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_24:1.0000:Whether the wind blow high, or low,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_25:1.0000:I work by sea, or land !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_26:0.9500:" All right you should, do you ask why,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_27:0.9500:And how, I make it clear ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_28:0.9750:In season man, your moments buy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0150_29:0.9500:And by the compass steer.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_1:1.0000:The roughest winds that ever blew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_2:1.0000:Blew just in their own season :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_3:1.0000:As all your troubles, ever grew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_4:0.9500:Where you were wanting reason."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_6:0.9750:Whatever I may say ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_7:1.0000:You seem of me to make a bite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_8:1.0000:For which, I've got to pay."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_10:1.0000:When well appli'd, as food ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_11:1.0000:Will put the system all to rights,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_12:0.9750:And do you lasting good.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_13:1.0000:But droppings of the meagre sort,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_14:1.0000:Can never stand the test ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_15:1.0000:You buy a tankard for a groat :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_16:1.0000:And off goes all the rest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_17:1.0000:You happen, to this class belong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_18:1.0000:O'er head and ears in war !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_19:1.0000:Wrangling and jangling in a throng,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_20:0.9750:Driving the Devil's car.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_21:0.9750:And thus, you spend your time for naught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_22:0.9750:Nay, worse than naught, I say ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_23:0.9750:You're in the stream of drinking caught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_24:0.9750:Which runs yourself away !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_27:0.9750:My stomach now begins to stir,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0151_28:0.9500:I like a drop of drink."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_2:1.0000:Then labour for your self ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_3:1.0000:That wife and family may smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_4:1.0000:With bites upon your shelf !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_5:0.9750:" I think my eyes are opening sir,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_6:1.0000:I fancy I can see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_7:0.9750:Throughout my life, I've made a blur,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_8:1.0000:That's nearly ruin'd me !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_9:1.0000:For now, as I begin to think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_10:1.0000:If when in youth so gay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_11:1.0000:I'd sav'd my money spent in drink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_12:0.9500:I need not work to-day."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_13:0.9500:" Well man, I'm glad you've got your eye;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_14:0.9750:Wherewith to have a sight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_15:1.0000:Of something that may make you wise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_16:0.9750:'Ere day, recline to night.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_17:1.0000:A time there is for every thing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_18:1.0000:To work, that all may thrive ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_19:1.0000:The Bee, in summer, on the wing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_20:1.0000:Brings honey to the hive."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_21:1.0000:" That's true, if ever truth you spoke :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_22:0.9500:And now I'll strive to mend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_23:0.9750:Tho' late, I find that life's no joke :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_24:1.0000:My time will shortly end."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_25:0.9750:" Well, now my friend, you see quite clear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_26:0.9500:That head and hands together,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0152_27:0.9750:(By grace, and reason, onward steer ;)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_1:0.9500:Then, pray to God, to help you on ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_2:0.9500:(Whose blessing shall be given :)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_3:1.0000:That when your work, on earth is done ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_4:0.9750:He take you home, to Heaven."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_10:1.0000:Full many a bitter sordid gale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_11:0.9750:The saints have to engage.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_12:1.0000:Yet by and bye, shall mount on high :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_13:1.0000:Beyond their raging tower ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_14:0.9750:And every pinching blast defy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_15:0.9500:When lodg'd in " Eden's Bower."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_16:1.0000:Where lovely roses ever spring,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_17:1.0000:To bloom, and blossom there ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_18:1.0000:These laurels to Emmanuel bring,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_19:1.0000:And each a crown shall wear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_20:1.0000:Come then with me, rejoice and sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_21:1.0000:We'll conquer in the field ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0153_22:1.0000:And make the hills and vallies ring,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_1:1.0000:Our captain rides the milk white horse,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_2:1.0000:With armies by his side ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_3:1.0000:Marching along the heavenly course,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_4:1.0000:The " Bridegroom and the Bride."*
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_5:1.0000:No more by winds and tempests driven,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_6:1.0000:Have cross'd the swelling tide ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_7:1.0000:All landed, in the port of heaven !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_8:1.0000:Where Jesus doth reside.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_9:1.0000:Those who arrive in Eden's bower,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_10:1.0000:So lovely and so fair ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_11:0.9500:Shall each inhale a balmy shower,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_12:0.9750:Of sweet salubrious air.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_13:0.9750:While zephyrs wafting mildly fan
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_14:1.0000:Their fragrance and perfume ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_15:1.0000:Thus to invigorate the man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_16:1.0000:Who wears the bright costume. f
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_17:0.9750:Here, all their senses pregnant are
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_18:1.0000:With love, which makes them free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_20:1.0000:To shine eternally ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_21:1.0000:Not only so, but music grand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_22:1.0000:Shall vibrate through the whole ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_23:1.0000:And in this Bower ; (the " happy land ;")
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0154_24:0.9750:We ne'er regret the fall.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_1:0.9750:Far risen now, beyond the joy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_2:0.9500:Of Paradise below, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_3:1.0000:Where nothing can our peace annoy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_4:0.9500:But happier ever grow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_5:0.9750:The marriage feast is on, and all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_6:1.0000:May freely now partake,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_7:0.9750:Come at a word, attend the call,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_8:1.0000:And eat for Jesu's sake.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_9:1.0000:Behold, the splendid sumptuous cheer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_10:1.0000:A never ending store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_11:1.0000:Drink, at the crystal fountain here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_12:0.9500:And live for ever more !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_16:1.0000:Can you expect the best of wage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_17:1.0000:To make, and hold your treasure ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_18:1.0000:Attend ye then, to truth laid bare ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_19:0.9750:God's word alone can stand :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_20:1.0000:Nor yet th' inconigible spare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_21:1.0000:Who break, his " known command."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_22:1.0000:And they who wont adhere to it,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_23:1.0000:Condemn'd already are ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_24:1.0000:Nor can they now in comfort sit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0155_25:1.0000:Or drive the " peaceful car."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_2:1.0000:Mark ! in usage of the ill got store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_3:0.9750:Which some would call their own ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_4:1.0000:And ever gasping after more ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_5:1.0000:The seeds of Death are sown !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_6:0.9750:The Sabbath violated, must
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_7:1.0000:The wrath of God provoke ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_8:1.0000:And they who smelt the Iron-dust,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_9:1.0000:Prepare the servile yoke.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_10:1.0000:Tho', daily warning, " such have given,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_11:1.0000:The holy day to hold ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_12:1.0000:Yet, counter to the laws of heaven,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_13:0.9750:They feed the •' metal mould."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_14:1.0000:Take off, take off the Furnace blast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_15:1.0000:Nor fire the Sabbath day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_16:1.0000:Or surely you will make the cast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_17:1.0000:For which you'll have to pay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_18:1.0000:No matter what your business be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_19:1.0000:Your maker knows it all ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_21:1.0000:And do, or down you fall.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_22:1.0000:Fall where ? (say you in vague pretence,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_24:1.0000:" Into the burning pit, from whence
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_25:1.0000:You cannot rise again !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_26:1.0000:The " Iron chain," with which you are
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_27:0.9750:At present, " thus engag'd"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_28:0.9750:Will hold adherents faster far —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_30:0.9750:Th' hand-writing, is upon the wall !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0156_31:0.9500:Against the man who will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_1:0.9500:Belshazzar's impious feast, read o'er,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_2:1.0000:Open your eyes, and see ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_3:1.0000:Mark, what is said as heretofore :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_5:1.0000:And shall your money-making, blow
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_6:1.0000:The fiery furnace blast ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_7:0.9750:To quaff, in flames of hell below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_8:0.9500:The ruin'd soul at last !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_9:1.0000:My fellow man, take this reproof,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_10:1.0000:With what you've had before :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_11:1.0000:Unto the " wise," I've said enough,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_18:0.9750:And where is all my treasure ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_19:0.9500:Should I those precious moments lose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_20:1.0000:Which goodness grants to me ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_21:1.0000:The fountain here will shortly close,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_22:0.9500:And thus exhausted be.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_23:1.0000:Our time, and health, and wealth, are such
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_24:1.0000:In value, none can count !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_25:1.0000:And yet, if wanting e'er so much,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0157_26:1.0000:May lose the whole amount.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_2:0.9750:Tho', often latter first ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_3:1.0000:Much worse than neutralizing facts,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_4:1.0000:By which the boon is lost.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_5:1.0000:That should while here, enhance the bliss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_6:1.0000:Of all the thinking race, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_7:0.9750:Who never need one moment miss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_8:1.0000:T' improve the day of grace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_9:1.0000:The structure, which is form'd upright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_10:1.0000:With head so nobly grand !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_11:1.0000:Will bear, and keep, the polish bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_12:0.9500:Which Christians understand.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_13:1.0000:Best faculties are plac'd in front,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_14:1.0000:Inferior ones behind, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_15:1.0000:Which never need retard, or blunt,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_16:0.9750:Good feelings of the mind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_17:1.0000:Vast idle talk, and foolish joke,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_18:0.9500:Are practis'd, far too oft,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_19:1.0000:Reducing mind, to creep or walk,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_20:1.0000:When it should soar aloft.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_21:0.9750:Where bright Creation issues forth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_22:1.0000:The wise designs of him,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_23:1.0000:Who made, and plac'd mankind on earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_24:1.0000:And gave the active limb !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_25:1.0000:But, not to loiter in the field
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_26:0.9750:Of action, while below —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0158_27:1.0000:Or else, his stock can never yield,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_1:0.9750:Sweet peace of mind, with true content,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_2:1.0000:In every station free !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_3:1.0000:Nor e'er a moment vainly spent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_6:0.9500:Our moments, and minutes, form hours, and days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_7:1.0000:Which swell into months, and to years ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_8:1.0000:All the past, are far gone, no more to return,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_10:1.0000:As this is the case, we must leave the old place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_18:0.9750:The system was thrown out of joint.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_20:0.9750:While keeping a portion to taste ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_22:0.9750:And nvns the whole system to waste.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_24:0.9750:And make the poor invalid well ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_25:0.9750:It springs from the fountain of poisonous juice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0159_26:1.0000:And brew'd in the suburbs of Hell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_3:1.0000:And with the contents he will lull you to sleep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_4:1.0000:Till into commotion you slip.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_5:1.0000:Awak'd by the rumour, you lift up your eyes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_6:0.9750:To behold what a mess you are in !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_7:1.0000:But now you are caught, tho' you look with surprise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_8:0.9500:All this " is the wages of sin."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_9:1.0000:I have heard him say thus, draw nigh if you please.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_11:1.0000:Do take a wee drop, man ! and sit at your ease,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_12:0.9750:The waters enchanted, are sweet !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_13:1.0000:The simple are trapped (by these sorry wiles)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_17:1.0000:" Let me, of the waters of Meribah drink,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_19:1.0000:With faculties sober, to speak, and to think,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_20:0.9750:Of him, who gave " Moses the rod."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_21:0.9500:With which, the rock smote, and the waters gush'd out.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_22:0.9750:To supply the lack of the day —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_25:0.9750:Now let us attend, to the word of our friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_26:1.0000:While thus, in the desert we are ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_28:0.9500:Our Captain, hath finish'd the war.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_29:1.0000:Where rivers of water, for ever do flow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_30:1.0000:In streams, from " Emmanuel's side !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0160_31:0.9750:And fruits, in abundance, delightfully grow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_10:1.0000:And let him see with hoth his eyes !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_11:1.0000:So then, he took the woful dose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_12:1.0000:Which bred within, " a world of foes !"

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_15:0.9750:It's operation's hard to tell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_16:1.0000:We judge of Physic by the smell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_17:1.0000:And yet, the draught of sin is such,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_18:1.0000:Man never thinks he gets too much :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_19:1.0000:Until his die be nearly cast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_20:0.9750:And then, he may repent at last.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_21:1.0000:" When Adam fell a prey to this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_22:1.0000:He spoilt his beauty, health, and bliss,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_23:1.0000:Tho' he was duke, and lord, and knight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_24:1.0000:He sacrific'd his honor bright !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0161_25:1.0000:And confiscated the estate
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_1:1.0000:Then, doom'd himself to ruin quite,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_2:1.0000:And fix'd us, in an awful plight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_3:1.0000:A " friend" in need, was just at hand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_4:1.0000:Who bought the confiscated land.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_5:1.0000:And more, by his redeeming plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_6:1.0000:Than did at first belong to man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_7:1.0000:To us, who caus'd him grief, and pain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_8:1.0000:He gave possession once again ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_9:1.0000:That we, might reinstated be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_10:1.0000:And hold the same eternally.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_11:1.0000:Tho' " quacks" make up their dozes yet,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_14:0.9500:(As they would have us understand)

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_17:0.9750:Or worse than e'er he was before,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_18:0.9750:And mark him down a double score 5 ~~
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_19:0.9500:Which he can never, never pay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0162_20:1.0000:Thus is he crippl'd every day.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0163_5:1.0000:And then, while endless ages roll ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0163_6:0.9750:He's bless'd in body, and in soul.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0163_8:0.9750:Nor can he have, or wish for more.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0163_21:0.9750:When mortal life shall close.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0163_22:1.0000:Nor can we calculate the sum

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0164_19:0.9750:In odorif'rous fume ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0164_20:1.0000:Each breeze, the song of love repeats,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0164_21:1.0000:And spreads her golden plume.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0164_22:1.0000:The joys of this jasminion state,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_7:1.0000:And then, the increase ever will
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_9:1.0000:Far more than all the world below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_10:1.0000:And all the powers above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_17:1.0000:Shall be my theme, in every word,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_18:0.9500:Until my latest hour.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_19:1.0000:Beneficence, and free good-will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_20:1.0000:By his redeeming grace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_21:1.0000:My heart with gratitude shall fill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_22:1.0000:In every time, and place.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_23:1.0000:His works, so wonderfully great,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_24:1.0000:And mercy without end !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_25:1.0000:Induce my soul on him to wait,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0165_26:1.0000:And all my time to spend.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_1:0.9500:Thus, to his honor, glory, praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_2:1.0000:And ownself benefit ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_3:1.0000:Commencing in my early days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_5:1.0000:Wherein to read, and learn, and know.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_6:1.0000:And mark the path to tread !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_7:1.0000:And then, the same to others show ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_8:1.0000:To furnish heart, and head.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_9:1.0000:That, wise unto salvation, each
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_11:1.0000:And as young " Timothy," I'll preach ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_16:0.9500:Their Maker's voice without a word !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_18:1.0000:The boist'rous wind, the whisp'ring wind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_19:1.0000:The tempests howling yell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_20:0.9750:While passing, leave a sound behind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_21:1.0000:Inquiring, is all well ? —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_22:1.0000:The waters, gliding gently by ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_23:1.0000:The torrents, rapid move ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_24:1.0000:In tacit language, each reply,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0166_25:0.9750:Our author lives above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_1:1.0000:The fire, the hail, the snow, the sleet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_2:1.0000:With every drop of rain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_3:1.0000:In element'ry tone repeat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_4:1.0000:The subject o'er again.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_5:1.0000:The thunder's loud terrific roll ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_6:0.9750:The vivid lightning's dart ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_7:0.9500:Speak plainly, to the human soul,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_8:1.0000:And daunt the stoutest heart !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_9:0.9500:The seas, in one perpetual roar,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_10:0.9750:Are quite distinctly heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_11:1.0000:By those, upon the ocean shore,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_13:0.9500:Such howlings in the wilderness,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_14:0.9750:Throughout the valley run ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_15:0.9750:While every sound speaks nothing less,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_16:0.9500:Than, time is moving on.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_17:1.0000:The mountains, stand a monument,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_19:0.9750:And now, to us, do represent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_20:1.0000:Subject, of " Babel's tower."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_21:1.0000:The air we breathe, is freely given,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_22:0.9750:Tho' every breath we spend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_23:1.0000:This language speaks (direct from heaven,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_24:1.0000:" Your time must shortly end !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_25:0.9750:War, pestilence, and famine too,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_26:1.0000:With all diseases sure :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_27:1.0000:Just witness this, and clearly shew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_28:1.0000:God can't with sin endure.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_29:1.0000:But, let us take a pleasing view,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0167_31:0.9750:Which spake the world, and all things new !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_1:0.9750:Behold, yon brilliant orb of day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_2:1.0000:And listen to his speech ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_3:0.9750:Hear him in tacit language say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_4:0.9500:" I daily sermons preach !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_5:1.0000:He casts his light, and heat, around,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_6:1.0000:On both our hemispheres ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_7:1.0000:And animates the solid ground,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_8:1.0000:From whence all life appears.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_9:1.0000:Witness yon vegetation spring,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_10:1.0000:On which the living feed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_11:1.0000:The menial, mendicant, and king, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_13:1.0000:The moon, dependent on the sun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_14:1.0000:Holds forth her splendid torch ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_15:1.0000:Who, but for him, had ne'er begun.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_16:0.9500:To take her nightly march.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_17:0.9750:The brilliant stars which twinkling shine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_18:0.9500:Speak forth their author's name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_19:1.0000:Each bears this mark, " the hand divine,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_20:0.9750:Doth shine in every flame !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_21:1.0000:All these celestial things are high ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_22:0.9750:Far, far above our reach !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_23:0.9750:And yet, their voice is heard so nigh :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_24:0.9750:We understand their speech.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_25:1.0000:But let us now descend again,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_26:0.9750:And listen while below ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_27:1.0000:To all the vegetative train,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_28:0.9500:That whisper as they grow.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_29:0.9750:A smile there is, on every flower !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_30:1.0000:And as we look, they nod ,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0168_31:1.0000:And state, " they're subjects of an hour,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_1:0.9750:While trees, which bear their fruit so well,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_2:0.9500:May blossom and look gay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_3:1.0000:Their language is, " your parents fell,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_4:0.9750:And we must soon decay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_5:1.0000:The bloom is shed, the fruit is cast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_6:1.0000:And every leaf shall fall ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_7:1.0000:The tree itself, now drops at last,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_9:1.0000:Mankind, so healthy, blithe, and gay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_10:1.0000:Who, like the lily grew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_11:1.0000:In colour splendid, pass away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_12:0.9750:Just as the " morning dew."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_13:1.0000:Now what shall I say more to those,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_14:1.0000:Who cannot read, or spell ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_15:1.0000:In tacit language I suppose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_16:0.9750:You hear the warning bell.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_17:1.0000:And if you cannot hear, your eyes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_19:0.9750:And learn a lesson by the wise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_21:1.0000:But, if you can't by this display,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_22:1.0000:Discern the truth so plain,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_23:1.0000:We'll try it in another way,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_24:1.0000:Which may prove endless gain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_25:1.0000:'Tis this, " the passions of the mind,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_26:1.0000:You harbour, or remove ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_27:0.9500:Retain the one, that's ever kind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_31:1.0000:Within himself, then shall he know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0169_32:0.9750:The great redeeming plan.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_2:0.9750:A heart renew'd by grace alone ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_3:0.9500:The vilest one may feel,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_4:1.0000:And bless the day, that he was born,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_5:0.9750:With impress of the seal !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_6:0.9750:The still, small voice, now speaks within ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_7:0.9750:No language half so plain :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_8:1.0000:It tells him, he is clear of sin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_9:1.0000:And woo's him to remain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_10:1.0000:The " Tacitonia" ever speaks,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_11:1.0000:In sentiment sublime ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_12:1.0000:And he, who wisdom, truly seeks,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_13:1.0000:Must find it while in time.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_14:1.0000:Which now, is ebbing out apace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_15:1.0000:And not a moment still !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_16:1.0000:So, like the tide, in every place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_17:1.0000:Where rising, swells the bill.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_18:1.0000:Now, if the day of grace is spent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_19:1.0000:In idleness and play ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_20:1.0000:Be sure of this, you must repent,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_21:1.0000:That e'er you saw the day.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_22:1.0000:But, if each moment you improve,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_23:0.9750:And listen to the voice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_24:1.0000:Which speaks no language else but love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_25:1.0000:You've made a noble choice !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_26:1.0000:In her embrace, you live and die ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_27:1.0000:Then, live to die no more :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_28:1.0000:But reign with " Christ" beyond the sky ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_29:1.0000:For he hath gone before.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_32:0.9500:And form'd deep projects in the shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0170_33:0.9500:By his Redeeming plan !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_1:1.0000:The still, small voice, is surely heard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_2:0.9750:And secret truths reveal'd ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_3:1.0000:In tacit language, by his word :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_4:1.0000:When with the spirit seal'd !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_9:0.9500:""" The whole of which you need ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_10:0.9750:And watch withal, his signal nod,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_11:1.0000:Who doth the armies lead.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_13:1.0000:While in the midst of strife ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_14:1.0000:Attend the holy spirit's call ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_15:1.0000:Lay hold on endless life !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_16:1.0000:Can we obey yon chief's command r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_17:1.0000:With carnal weapons fight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_18:1.0000:Against mankind by sea, or land !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_19:1.0000:In slaughter take delight ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_21:0.9750:Contending with each other ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_22:0.9750:But Christian nations, won't connive,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_23:0.9500:And fight against their brother.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_24:1.0000:Ah, no ! the principle of love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_25:1.0000:Possesses ev'ry breast !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_26:0.9750:Peaceful, and harmless, as a dove
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0171_27:0.9750:Returning to her iest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_1:1.0000:The noblest battle ever fought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_2:1.0000:Since time on earth began ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_4:0.9750:Salvation unto man.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_5:1.0000:No greater power exists, than love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_6:1.0000:'Twill conquer every foe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_7:1.0000:But, if we from the camp remove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_8:1.0000:Then quite astray we go.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_9:1.0000:The " Christian victor" may I prove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_10:1.0000:O'er sin, and death, and hell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_11:0.9750:By Christ's appointed weapon, love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_12:1.0000:Which always answers well.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_13:1.0000:To work the golden rule, whereby
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_14:1.0000:All Christian people live ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_15:0.9750:And imitate their Saviour's cry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_16:0.9500:" Father ! I pray forgive."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_17:1.0000:And now the conquest he hath seal'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_18:1.0000:With his most precious blood ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_19:1.0000:The secret truly is reveal'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_20:1.0000:And by us understood.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_21:0.9750:See you to this, the golden thread.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_22:0.9500:Force through the needle's eye :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_23:1.0000:One single touch can raise the dead,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_24:1.0000:And make the Devil fly !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_25:1.0000:As brethren, let us love, and live
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_26:0.9750:In virtue of His name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_27:1.0000:Who did His life for mortals give,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0172_28:0.9500:And peace on earth proclaim.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_1:0.9750:That everlasting peace we might
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_2:0.9500:Enjoy in realms above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_3:1.0000:Where Heavenly armies never fight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_4:0.9500:In sweet harmonic love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_10:1.0000:With blood the battle seal'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_11:1.0000:All slain, and wounded, what a sight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_12:1.0000:For Christians to behold !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_13:1.0000:Speak out, and tell me, is it right,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_14:1.0000:To barter life for gold ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_15:0.9750:The conq'rers then did prostitute,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_16:1.0000:The widows of the slain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_17:1.0000:And put to death, (to gain their suit,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_18:0.9750:The children that remain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_19:1.0000:All this was done, and vastly more
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_20:1.0000:Than prudence bids me name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_21:1.0000:While rapine, murder, death and gore,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_22:1.0000:They term, a noble game !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_23:0.9500:And then, forsooth, those valiant men ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0173_25:0.9500:Will try the same trick o'er again,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_1:1.0000:Our British heroes loath to see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_2:1.0000:Such hase inhuman work !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_3:1.0000:Would strive to set the captive free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_4:1.0000:And thus, assist the " Turk."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_5:1.0000:The French, and English, (both allied,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_6:0.9750:Are gone to quell their rage !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_7:1.0000:'Mid frost and snow, 'gainst wind and tide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_8:1.0000:The " Russians" to engage.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_9:1.0000:The' " Wellington," and " Bonaparte,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_10:1.0000:In battle spent their day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_11:1.0000:And forty millions (annual smart,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_12:1.0000:Have left, for us to pay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_13:0.9750:" 'Tis true, that hostile parties we,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_14:1.0000:Full many a year have fought !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_15:0.9750:Opposing each, by land and sea,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_16:1.0000:While in the trap, we're caught."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_17:0.9750:And then, those valiant men they say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_18:1.0000:Just fight, to make us bread ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_19:1.0000:Altho' for it we've dear to pay, .
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_20:0.9750:And feast upon the dead.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_21:1.0000:A title then, is given to,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_22:1.0000:The hero of the gang ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_23:1.0000:Who did the bravest murder do,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_24:1.0000:Where peals of vict'ry rang !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_25:1.0000:Thousands of pounds are settl'd on,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_26:0.9500:The " villain" for his deed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_27:1.0000:By which, he thinks, all's right he's done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_28:0.9500:He's now of noble breed !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_29:1.0000:O ! shame upon you, fie for shame ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_30:0.9750:All those who honor such,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_31:1.0000:Break useful limbs, to bind with fame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0174_32:1.0000:And help them with a crutch.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_1:0.9500:Away with titles, names, and power,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_2:0.9750:Obtain' d by roguish art !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_3:0.9750:Which lesson dignity, the flower
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_4:1.0000:Of man, with generous heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_5:1.0000:The stipendary bounties swell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_6:1.0000:And fill the breast with glee !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_7:1.0000:While " honor's" tickling music bell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_8:1.0000:Drowns every sight they see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_9:1.0000:And only simpletonians yield,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_10:0.9750:Who can't foresee the evil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_11:1.0000:This truth is prov'd in battle-field.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_13:0.9500:In whose vile service, are engag'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_14:1.0000:To murder, cut, and slay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_15:0.9750:All hell's let loose, and so enrag'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_16:1.0000:That none can win the day.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_17:1.0000:Weapons of deep destruction are
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_18:0.9750:Sheath'd in a brother's side !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_19:1.0000:While thus he cries, don't cut and mar.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_20:0.9500:The son of Father's bride!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_21:1.0000:Hold, brother, hold, I'm not in jest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_22:1.0000:See what a deadly wound :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_24:1.0000:Here dying on the ground!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_25:1.0000:Big tears I'll shed, for you, my brother,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_26:1.0000:My heart doth well nigh burst ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_27:1.0000:I hope you'll never slay another :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_28:0.9750:Farewell, here's dust to dust.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_29:0.9750:And will you designate him lord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_30:0.9750:Or noble duke, or knight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0175_31:1.0000:Who, wantonly can use the sword,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_1:0.9500:The appellation's out of place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_2:1.0000:Alike in word and deed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_3:1.0000:Pray, who would wish the sad disgrace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_4:0.9750:Entail'd upon their seed ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_5:1.0000:None, but the vicious ones whose yoke,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_7:0.9500:' Through seas of gore, they proudly stalk,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_8:1.0000:And drive the Devil's car.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_9:1.0000:With sword in hand, the bay'net too,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_10:0.9750:Big guns, are charg'd to fire !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_11:1.0000:They shoot, and cut, and slay, but who
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_12:1.0000:Their practise can admire ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_14:0.9500:Big with brutality !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_15:1.0000:With scarce a touch of human kind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_16:0.9750:Lost all humanity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_17:1.0000:They take up arms, forsooth, to kill
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_18:0.9750:Mankind, without occasion ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_19:1.0000:Then rob the dead, their sacks to fill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_20:1.0000:And call it, just invasion. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_22:0.9750:(Of those, whom they have slain ;)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_23:1.0000:Plund'ring, and style it nobly good,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_24:1.0000:To live, by roguish gain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_25:1.0000:Ah ! mean, mean, mean, I can't but say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_26:1.0000:You hold it in succession ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_27:1.0000:All primogeniture's queer day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_28:1.0000:And call't a lord's possession.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_29:0.9750:But, can you eat, and drink with pleasure.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_30:0.9500:The proceeds of the same ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0176_31:1.0000:And do you now enjoy the treasure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_2:1.0000:But where, I cannot tell :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_3:0.9500:Emp'rors, and Kings, do travel on,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_4:1.0000:And ring the warning bell.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_5:1.0000:For us, who yet in time may act,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_6:1.0000:And still push on the deed ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_7:1.0000:But mark, this grave, and sterling fact, ,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_9:1.0000:The fruit of which, we soon shall reap, .
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_10:1.0000:When time with us shall end ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_11:0.9750:Who, God's commandments will not keep ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_12:0.9500:Have lost their only friend.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_13:0.9750:" Hark ye ! the shrill, alarming sound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_14:1.0000:From " Alma's" battle field !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_18:0.9500:Ambition is my foe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_19:1.0000:While in the " Crimea" thousands fall,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0177_20:1.0000:And sink in endless woe.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_2:1.0000:From those who list to fight ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_3:1.0000:Their aim and object is distress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_4:1.0000:Who, wrong prefer, to right.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_7:0.9500:pf those who have obtain'd their prize,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_12:0.9750:Or Devils will devour.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_13:1.0000:This soul of mine, this precious soul !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_14:1.0000:Ah ! when the spirits fled,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_20:1.0000:Are they in bless'd repose ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_22:1.0000:Great owners of the land !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0178_23:1.0000:Who strive to put the world to rights,

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0179_3:0.9500:As justice reigns beyond the grave :

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0179_14:1.0000:Responsibility is such :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0179_15:1.0000:Big stewards have the most.

fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_8:1.0000:With nothing to remove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_9:0.9750:And worse than nothing, you will find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_10:1.0000:When summon' d to account ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_11:1.0000:Your goods, and all, are left behind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_12:1.0000:And empty is the fount.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_14:1.0000:This privilege is ours, to live,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_15:1.0000:While here, and vastly more !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_16:1.0000:'Tis God's prerogative to give
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_17:0.9500:To the improved store.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_23:0.9750:The God of power turn'd night to day;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0180_24:1.0000:And then appear' d a splendid sight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_1:0.9750:Creation ! heaven, and earth apart,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_2:1.0000:Fixt by his own Almighty word ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_3:1.0000:Who first to Nature gave a start
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_4:0.9750:Propell'd in order, by its Lord.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_6:1.0000:And all the varied Planets shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_7:0.9750:In perpetuity to move,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_8:1.0000:And speak their origin divine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_10:0.9750:And sing in sweet harmonic lays ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_11:0.9750:The Planetudinarian voice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_12:1.0000:Is heard to sound its Author's praise !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_13:1.0000:On Earth, the green grass now appears,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_14:1.0000:With Shrubs, and Plants, of varied hue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_15:0.9750:Which in successive months and years,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_16:1.0000:Present a fresh and pleasing view.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_18:1.0000:Laden with rich, delicious fruit ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_19:1.0000:While zephyrs waft their lovely breeze,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_20:1.0000:And Nature wears her first new suit !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_21:0.9750:Then, Man was made, the Lord of all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_22:0.9750:Created things, by sea or land ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_23:1.0000:Birds, Fish, and Beasts, both great and small,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_24:1.0000:Subservient to his sole command.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_25:1.0000:An help-mate for him, now sprang forth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_26:0.9750:Created by Almighty power ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_27:1.0000:Which gave to Nature all its worth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0181_28:0.9500:The lovely, and fairest Flower !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_1:1.0000:And now to us the boon is giv'n !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_2:1.0000:The Son of God, of woman born.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_3:1.0000:Whereby, the golden knot is tied,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_4:1.0000:A. stanza, all in harmony !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_5:1.0000:Which never, never can subside,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_6:1.0000:Throughout a vast eternity !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_8:0.9750:The Creation is grand ! but can you behold
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_9:1.0000:The author of Nature within ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_10:1.0000:Who made the whole universe, not to be sold.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_11:0.9750:In bondage, a debtor to sin.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_12:1.0000:The world was presented to Man when upright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_13:1.0000:Tho' he has perverted the plan ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_14:1.0000:By actions immoral, turn'd day into night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_15:1.0000:And this was the ruin of man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_16:1.0000:Yet, order and harmony out of his reach,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_17:1.0000:In primitive style doth appear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_18:1.0000:All nature is vocal, attend to its speech,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_23:0.9500:Assiduous art must then engage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_24:1.0000:Their virulence to quell.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0182_25:1.0000:By answer mild, in soft reply
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_1:1.0000:Then, enmity will surely die,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_2:0.9750:Or sink in retrograde.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_3:1.0000:But if in wrath, the evil tongue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_4:1.0000:Be clink-ma-clank a going :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_5:0.9750:Iniquity is highly sprung,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_6:1.0000:Pernicious winds are blowing !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_7:1.0000:Thus, when two fires meet, you know
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_8:1.0000:They kick up such a blaze :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_9:1.0000:With bellows you begin to blow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_10:1.0000:And sparks fly out, all ways !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_11:1.0000:Good sort of folk may catch the flame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_12:0.9750:Which makes their bosom burn ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_13:1.0000:For indignation is the game,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_14:1.0000:We all are apt to learn.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_16:1.0000:Tho' storms and tempests do assail,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_17:1.0000:The man of courage bold ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_18:1.0000:They cannot over him prevail,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_20:1.0000:In patience do possess your soul,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_21:1.0000:And never dare to shrink ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_25:0.9500:The children in the fire !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_26:0.9750:Who stood the test, as honest men,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_28:0.9750:Let winds arise, and tempests rage,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_29:0.9750:No matter what befall !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0183_31:0.9750:You're safe amid them all !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_5:0.9500:^-^ And leave to Providence the rest ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_6:0.9750:Without presumptive air, or pride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_7:1.0000:Thus, will you make a trusty bride.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_8:1.0000:Obtaining what you little thought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_9:1.0000:A man, without a single groat :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_10:1.0000:Yet, never in this state despair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_11:1.0000:Your master will be always there.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_13:0.9750:And he'll conduct you to your home :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_14:1.0000:Where, happy you may ever be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_15:1.0000:Through time, and to eternity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_16:1.0000:My heart's desire, and wish, it is,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_17:0.9500:That he, be yours, and you be his :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_18:1.0000:In love and unity to dwell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_19:1.0000:Until you meet, where all fares well.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_20:1.0000:Adieu, adieu, once more I'll say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_21:0.9750:Just do your best, without delay :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0184_22:1.0000:As time and chance, will happen all,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_4:0.9750:The yielding heart propels the gale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_5:0.9750:Which envy first began.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_6:1.0000:And thus, the boist'rous winds arise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_7:0.9750:To fill the vacant bowl
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_8:1.0000:Of those, who think themselves more wise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_9:1.0000:Than is the virtuous soul.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_10:1.0000:And thus the vicious termagant,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_11:0.9500:Disturbs his own repose ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_12:1.0000:By fungus rais'd, to puff and pant,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_13:1.0000:With every wind that blows.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_14:1.0000:But, look at one who can't be caught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_15:1.0000:By cunning, flippant guile ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_16:1.0000:Nor ever can be sold or bought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_17:1.0000:By other's frown or smile.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_18:0.9750:The man of mind is sound and firm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_19:1.0000:As is the sturdy Oak,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_20:1.0000:Which stands the test in every storm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_21:0.9750:And never needs a cloak.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_22:1.0000:As every blast of wind that blows,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_23:0.9750:Accelerates the growth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0185_24:1.0000:Of all its fibrous roots and boughs,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_8:1.0000:To preach his own Gospel, tho' not understood
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_10:0.9750:" You know the thing well, nor can I dispute
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_11:0.9750:Your qualification in grace ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_12:1.0000:But come to my Church, held so high in repute,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_15:0.9750:To maintain our dignity here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_16:0.9750:Far, far above those who in shouting delight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_20:1.0000:We know that Philosophers always are queer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_21:1.0000:And often do handle the whip ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_22:1.0000:I beg you be gentle in using the thong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_23:1.0000:If such you may happen to need :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0186_24:0.9750:Nor lay it on frequent, or yet very strong,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_1:1.0000:Hear now, what I have got to say,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_2:1.0000:My message is divine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_3:1.0000:You've styl'd me a Philosopher !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_4:1.0000:Which may be right, I grant ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_5:1.0000:And when you make an open blur,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_6:1.0000:I'll give the thing you want.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_7:1.0000:You're not infallible, we know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_8:1.0000:As blinded " Pope" would be ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_9:1.0000:Nor ever to his Church will go,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_10:1.0000:Then listen unto me.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_11:0.9750:When Doctors, Bards, and Parsons, sir,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_12:1.0000:In matters disagree ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_13:0.9750:Then comes the true Philosopher,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_14:0.9750:To give them eyes to see.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_15:0.9750:But if through prejudice they will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_16:1.0000:Each one, contend he's right :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_17:1.0000:Such are in heathen darkness still ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_18:1.0000:With eyes, yet wanting sight !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_19:1.0000:Would sects, and parties, all agree,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_20:0.9500:And own the standard one ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_21:1.0000:In unity, the Church would be :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_22:1.0000:Each, hand in hand go on.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_23:1.0000:Now, search the scriptures, get the rvde
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_25:1.0000:And don't be stupid as a mule :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_26:1.0000:Christ did for all atone !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_27:1.0000:He is the true Philosopher,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_29:0.9750:Then, let us make a noble stir,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_30:0.9750:And out of bondage spring !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0187_31:0.9500:Vain bigotry, and self-conceit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_1:1.0000:Work up their ruin, so complete,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_2:1.0000:None can its own detect.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_3:1.0000:From hence, may each a lesson take ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_4:1.0000:Attend the trumpet call,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_5:1.0000:To watch and pray, for Jesu's sake !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_6:1.0000:That sects and parties fall.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_7:1.0000:And all the world be gather'd in,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_8:1.0000:To his delightful fold :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_9:1.0000:Then, Jesus Christ, alone shall win,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_15:1.0000:When snow and frost set in,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_16:1.0000:Very fit you should begin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_17:1.0000:O, ye rich, to remember the poor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_18:0.9750:I don't begrudge your wealth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_19:1.0000:But, I hope you have good health ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_20:1.0000:And incline to remember the poor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_22:0.9750:When my back begins to bow ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_23:0.9750:That's the time to remember the poor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_24:1.0000:While you sit by your fire,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_25:1.0000:I am pinch' d with winter's ire ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0188_26:0.9750:Now's the time to remember the poor !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_2:0.9750:Thus, in poverty do cry,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_3:1.0000:I beseech you, remember the poor !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_6:0.9750:I entreat you, remember the poor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_7:1.0000:I've spent my summer's day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_8:0.9750:All in jest, and foolish play ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_9:0.9750:Yet, I pray you remember the poor.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_11:0.9750:" God bless you in your store ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_12:0.9750:And I wish you, ten times more !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_13:1.0000:For, my Lord doth remember the poor."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_17:0.9500:And true enjoyment reigns :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_18:1.0000:Which springs from mental pow'rs alone,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_19:1.0000:And waxes in the summer's morn ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_20:1.0000:Nor in the evening wains.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_21:1.0000:Likewise in winter's stormy day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_22:0.9500:Blooms fair, and blossoms, as in May !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0189_23:0.9750:Producing lovely fruit :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_1:0.9500:Luxuriant, noble, pleasing, grand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_2:1.0000:Pluck'd by tbe muses liberal hand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_3:0.9500:All parties thus to suit.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_4:0.9750:Then, shall I spend my time and strength,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_5:1.0000:"Where suns can never run their length ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_6:1.0000:Or clouds obscure the day, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_7:1.0000:Nor rustling winds alarm the breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_8:1.0000:For ever in this peaceful rest ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_9:0.9500:Perpetual homage pay.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_10:1.0000:To him, who rules the pow'rs on high,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_11:0.9750:And whirls the spheres that rapid fly ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_12:1.0000:Propell'd from pole to pole !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_13:1.0000:Where, in the car which runs apace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_14:0.9500:Throughout this universal space,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_15:1.0000:Earth moves, and oceans roll.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_16:0.9750:Here let me in seclusion rest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_17:1.0000:With peace and true contentment bless' d ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_18:0.9750:The flames of love to fan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_19:0.9750:That those, who have but one small match :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_20:0.9500:May strike it, and that instant catch
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_21:0.9750:The privilege of man.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_22:1.0000:And now while on th' aonian mount !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_23:1.0000:Let me those golden figures count,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_24:1.0000:In this, my humble cot, —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_25:1.0000:Far from the world's invidious gaze,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_26:1.0000:Here, spend my short, or lengthen'd days :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_28:1.0000:And thus may I contribute, to
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_29:1.0000:The welfare of mankind, and show,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0190_30:0.9750:The light of truth, and grace :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_1:0.9750:That every soul of man may find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_2:0.9750:Within itself a noble mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_3:1.0000:Which time can not erace !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_4:1.0000:Nor, vast eternity impair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_5:1.0000:That vigorous strength, and structure fair
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_6:1.0000:Which rallies after time :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_7:1.0000:When atoms to their native soil
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_8:1.0000:Have made return, nor ere recoil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_9:1.0000:Immortal sons of rhyme !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_10:0.9750:Who live throughout time's utmost bound.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_11:1.0000:And yet, eternal ages round,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_12:1.0000:The muses ever swell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_13:1.0000:(Symphonious charms) in songs divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_14:1.0000:And strains of music, yours and mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_16:0.9750:Sweet harmony, in grand display !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_17:1.0000:Where angels and archangels pay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_18:1.0000:Their homage at his feet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_19:1.0000:Who caus'd the morning stars to sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_20:1.0000:At the command of Nature's king !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_21:1.0000:Creation's birth to greet.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_22:1.0000:And then again, when Christ was bcrn !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_23:0.9750:(The brightest star that ever shone,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_24:1.0000:On our benighted land.)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_25:1.0000:Sweet seraphs sang, in heavenly lays,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_26:1.0000:With golden harps, to sound his praise :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_28:1.0000:But, when th' atoning work was done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0191_29:0.9750:(The noblest vict'ry ever won ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_3:1.0000:Put on your silken dress.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_4:1.0000:Speak out, ye " Bards" of ancient times,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_5:1.0000:And modern too, in mystic rhymes ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_6:1.0000:Set forth the noble soul !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_7:1.0000:However musical your theme,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_8:1.0000:Your sound is far beneath the cream,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_9:0.9750:Of yon crystoral bowl !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_13:0.9750:In comfort and in peace to sit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_14:1.0000:With saints of humble birth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_15:1.0000:Far from the pest of anxious care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_17:1.0000:In works of goodwill, faith, and prayer,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_18:1.0000:Of sin and folly void.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_19:1.0000:Nigh half a Century I have been
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_20:0.9750:Engag'd with men and things ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_21:1.0000:Utopean changes often seen,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_22:1.0000:Which pain, or pleasure brings.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_23:1.0000:But yet, while moving on, in time,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_24:0.9500:A grand reality
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_25:1.0000:Presents itself, in truth sublime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0192_26:0.9750:A vast eternity !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_2:0.9750:May give a curs'ry glance ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_3:1.0000:And fancy pleasure, peace, or strife,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_4:0.9750:Is but the work of chance.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_5:1.0000:Delusive, vain, and foolish thought !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_7:1.0000:Man may be by this notion caught ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_8:1.0000:But, mark the consequence !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_9:1.0000:Our deeds, and words, and thoughts likewise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_10:1.0000:Contribute weal or woe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_11:1.0000:And stamp on us, the blank or prize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_12:1.0000:A lasting friend, or foe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_13:1.0000:From whom we ne'er can fly away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_15:0.9750:Depends on deeds of life's short day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_16:1.0000:Done by, both small and great !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_17:0.9750:Lord, let me publish to mankind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_18:1.0000:By thy dictation given ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_19:1.0000:That those may see, who now are blind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_20:0.9750:To find their way to heaven.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_21:1.0000:And likewise such as know the way,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_22:0.9750:Let these progressive rise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_23:1.0000:To win the long, and well fought day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_24:1.0000:And gain the noble prize.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_25:1.0000:That when we've spent our transient days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_26:0.9750:Beneath thy smile and ken ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_27:1.0000:We'll give thee honor, power, and praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0193_28:0.9750:World without end. Amen.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_5:1.0000:Where virtue's nearly spent.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_6:1.0000:But mind, with strength and fortitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_7:0.9500:Of energetic strain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_8:1.0000:Will cast the same in torpitude,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_9:0.9750:Forever to remain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_10:0.9500:'Twill never undervalue fame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_11:1.0000:Or merit, when 'tis due ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_12:1.0000:Which soars beyond what I can name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_13:1.0000:Obtain'd by very few.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_14:1.0000:The author spends his precious hours
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_15:1.0000:To benefit mankind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_16:1.0000:Collecting sweet and lovely flowers,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_17:0.9750:To ornament the mind.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_18:1.0000:Thousands have seen, and read with pleasure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_19:0.9750:Those subjects of the Bard,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_20:1.0000:From which obtain'd a mental treasure ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_21:1.0000:And tender' d him reward !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_22:1.0000:But prudence gently doth decline
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_23:0.9750:The compliment so free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_24:0.9750:She answers, they are yours and mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_25:0.9750:You, feast along with me.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_26:1.0000:Then let us pass probation here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_27:0.9500:In quiet and repose ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_28:0.9750:And then, hereafter never fear
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0194_29:0.9750:To be a blooming rose !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_5:0.9500:In splendoric glory they view.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_6:0.9500:How happy the man, who with feelings divine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_12:0.9500:In the chariot of love, both below and above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_14:0.9500:A display of the same, is made in his name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_15:0.9750:The principle ever to give — ■
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_18:0.9750:So well was it tested, and prov'd by the man —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_19:0.9500:Acquainted with sorrow and grief,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_20:0.9750:Who, through fire and water, so eagerly ran,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_22:0.9750:Now or never's the day, wherein we all may,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0195_24:1.0000:Remember the thief, who obtained relief,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_3:1.0000:Not a soul need be lost, (remember the cost,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_4:1.0000:Then tell me, who wouldn't believe ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_9:0.9750:And the price of the lily-white stone !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_10:1.0000:Away with the titles, and honor of those
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_11:1.0000:"Whose dignity lays in their name ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_12:0.9750:Well pleas'd with the rattle, until their life close,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_16:0.9500:Or a wind that is pass'd, no more to be found ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_18:0.9750:But what is it worth to the lively and gay ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_20:0.9500:If it's worth all the world unto them, as " they say,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_22:1.0000:What a vague speculation is this, to be made !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_23:0.9500:By a mortal endowed with mind !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0196_24:0.9750:Who leaves all his substance, to pine in the shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_1:0.9500:Nay, more than he had, is gone by illusion
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_2:1.0000:This world he hath sold, and the next ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_3:1.0000:For what is at best, a total delusion ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_4:0.9750:And now he may wander perplex' d !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_5:1.0000:The spirit is fled, which he knew nothing of.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_6:1.0000:Nor did he believe in a God,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_7:1.0000:Who made him for higher enjoyment above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_8:1.0000:Than matter produc'd from the sod.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_9:1.0000:And yet, all the product of earth is for man.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_10:1.0000:To receive and enjoy while below ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_11:1.0000:Tho' counter to wisdom and excellence ran
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_12:1.0000:From his birth, and still he would go !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_13:1.0000:While the trinkets and toys, the meat and the drink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_14:0.9750:The fashion, the pomp, and the pride,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_15:1.0000:Did benefit nothing, but left him to sink,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_16:1.0000:In despair ; thus the secular died !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_17:1.0000:The soul has now fled from its tenement here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_19:0.9500:'Mid the hope and the joy, the doubt and the fear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_20:1.0000:That cheer'd and distress'd him anon.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_21:1.0000:The man with big body, and little wee mind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_22:0.9750:Contracted according to wish ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_23:0.9750:May search all his lifetime, but nothing can find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_25:0.9750:Nor is this the worst of the subject in hand ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_26:0.9750:By the bait of the matter you know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0197_27:1.0000:The line gave a spring from the end of the wand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_6:0.9500:And the same will obtain at my own Fireside.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_13:0.9750:Tho' the comforts be small which I have to provide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_14:1.0000:Yet I like to taste all at my own Fireside.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_15:1.0000:With domestics around me, to cut and divide
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_16:1.0000:The provision you see, at my own Fireside,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_17:0.9500:Ah ! the evenings I spend ! with my comfort and guide,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_19:0.9500:When away from my cot, and a lodging denied !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_21:0.9750:The tempestuous storm, I have had to outride ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_22:0.9750:But the calm I affirm, is my own Fireside !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0198_25:1.0000:All attention is given, no blessing denied ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_11:1.0000:That every word and act may shew
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_12:0.9750:Thy will is my delight.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_13:1.0000:Thereby to feel within my breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_14:1.0000:The calm serenity,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_15:1.0000:With thy good spirit ever blest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_16:1.0000:My soul shall happy be.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_17:1.0000:Singing the song while here below,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_18:1.0000:Which Angels chant above ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_19:1.0000:Then shall I taste, and feel, and know,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_20:1.0000:The sweets of perfect love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_21:1.0000:Where saints who liv'd before the flood
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_22:1.0000:And ever since the fall ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0199_24:0.9750:And crown him Lord of all !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0200_16:0.9500:blown ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0200_17:0.9750:Then distill'd it, and bottl'd the essence alone,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_4:0.9500:As face answers truly to face in a glass,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_5:0.9750:The lovely shall answer to me.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_6:0.9500:An interlocutory, sweet interchange,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_7:1.0000:Of sentiment ever divine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_8:1.0000:Must spring from the principle, never to range,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_9:0.9500:Beyond the due boundary line.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_10:1.0000:The circle domestic, where harmony dwells ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_11:0.9750:The palace, to which you resort :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_12:1.0000:Each heart is responding, whose bosom now swells.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_13:0.9500:By the love, with which it is fraught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_14:1.0000:'Tis heaven on earth, so delightfully sweet:
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_15:1.0000:The positive smile of the bride !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_16:0.9750:Thus social, and freely, her partner to meet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_17:1.0000:Co-equal, protector, and guide.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_18:1.0000:Can angel's outvie in their happy estate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_19:1.0000:The connubial pair upon earth?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_20:1.0000:Whose joy is augmented, the more you dilate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_21:0.9500:On the subject of testing its worth !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_23:0.9750:Well, this is the state that I want to be in,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_24:1.0000:The sooner the better for me ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_25:1.0000:I wish to do well, and at once will begin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0201_26:1.0000:While single, unspotted, and free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_9:0.9500:Nor undertake the desp'rate case,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_10:1.0000:The foreign enemy to chase,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_11:1.0000:If each would only keep their place,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_13:1.0000:Let every Continent and Isle,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_14:1.0000:Put on the noble, gen'rous smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_15:1.0000:Which springs from bus'ness mercantile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_16:1.0000:With an honest heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_17:1.0000:Ye nations all rejoice to see
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_18:1.0000:The signal moral victory,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_19:1.0000:Re-opening out by land and sea !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_20:0.9750:Biitons, act your part !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_21:1.0000:The din of war is surely o'er !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_22:1.0000:Ye Nobles, butcher man no more ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_25:1.0000:All kingdoms of the earth rejoice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_26:1.0000:To hear the charming halcyon voice !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0202_27:0.9500:Be this the object of their choice,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_2:0.9500:To build their altars at the shrine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_8:0.9750:Peace, in perfect love !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_9:1.0000:Then let the world in harmony,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_10:0.9750:Unite in choral symphony !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_11:0.9750:And sing the song of liberty,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_12:0.9750:Be he, black or white !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_13:0.9750:If all but start upon the key,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_14:1.0000:Which set the ancient Britons free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_15:0.9750:Music shall ring from sea to sea !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_19:0.9750:Thy peace would as a river be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_20:0.9750:Flowing, far and wide.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_21:0.9500:Thy righteousness would then abound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_22:1.0000:As waves that in the sea are found ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0203_23:0.9500:Yet firmly fixt on solid ground !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_5:0.9500:And laid his valour low.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_6:1.0000:But Alexander still remains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_7:1.0000:To wash out all the bloody stains,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_8:1.0000:And close the crimson current veins,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_9:1.0000:Then open'd by the foe.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_10:0.9750:Nor can I ever count the cost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_11:0.9750:Of precious souls and bodies lost !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_13:1.0000:Where they can rise no more ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_15:1.0000:By those who did their brothers slay !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_16:1.0000:Each must attend the judgment day,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_17:0.9500:And pay the awful score.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_18:1.0000:Take good advice my friends, in time,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_19:1.0000:At home, or in a foreign clime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_20:0.9750:And let your hearts with Music chime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_21:0.9750:The song of mutual love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_22:0.9750:Be emulous, each to excell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_23:1.0000:In unity together dwell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_24:1.0000:Then shall we meet, where all fares well !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0204_25:0.9500:With Christ, our friend above.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_5:1.0000:Nature, to make his beauties known,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_6:1.0000:Must mingle colours not her own.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_7:0.9500:No adequate conception, man
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_8:1.0000:Can have of his redeeming plan ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_9:1.0000:And yet, I'll strive my best to show,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_10:1.0000:What Jesus is, from what I know :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_11:1.0000:Art thou compar'd to bread and wine ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_12:1.0000:Let me partake of thee, and thine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_13:1.0000:Dear Lord, that I may thus be fed,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_14:1.0000:On living wine, and living bread.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_15:1.0000:Art thou the tree, whose healing leaves,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_16:0.9750:Salvation gives, which man receives ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_17:0.9750:The noble branch, the fruitful bough !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_18:0.9750:King David's root, and offspring too ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_20:1.0000:Whose scent perfumes the vital air ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_21:1.0000:Who doth the same so freely give,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_22:1.0000:Then, let me taste its sweets and live.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_23:0.9750:Art Thou the lily of the vale,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_24:1.0000:AVherewith our senses to regale ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_25:1.0000:Let me be clad in thy costume ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_26:1.0000:Which moth and rust can not consume.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_27:0.9750:Art Thou the vine, whose living root
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0205_28:0.9750:Supplies the boughs with heavenly fruit ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_3:1.0000:Created things, both great and small ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_4:1.0000:Then grant me Thy goodwill and might,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_5:1.0000:To guide my thoughts and steps aright.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_6:1.0000:Art thou a fountain for all sin ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_7:1.0000:Ah ! let me bathe my soul therein !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_8:1.0000:Its waters shall the whole renew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_9:1.0000:And cleanse my dirty garment too.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_10:1.0000:Art Thou a fire ? then purge my dross,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_11:1.0000:Nor let the gold sustain a loss ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_12:1.0000:But may th' refiner ever sit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_13:1.0000:And tread the refuse 'neath his feet.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_16:0.9750:On which to build my all upon ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_18:1.0000:Art Thou the way that leads to God ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_19:0.9750:The path in which our fathers trod.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_20:1.0000:Learn me to walk therein with zeal ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_21:1.0000:And in my soul Thyself reveal.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_22:1.0000:Art thou the door, by which to enter,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_23:1.0000:Where all is love, with thee the centre r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_24:1.0000:And none admitted but the wise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_25:1.0000:Who know thou art their only prize !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_26:0.9500:Art thou the chief, the corner stone ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_27:1.0000:Help me to build on thee alone :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_28:0.9500:That I may claim yon house above ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_30:0.9750:Art thou the temple ? there I'll dwell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_31:0.9750:And of thy glorious wonders tell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0206_32:0.9750:In songs of praise for ever more,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_1:0.9750:Where saints and angels, thee adore.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_2:0.9500:Art thou the bright, and morning star r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_3:1.0000:Riding in love's majestic car !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_4:1.0000:Laden with all the fruits of grace,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_5:1.0000:For those who see thee, face to face.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_6:1.0000:Art thou the sun of righteousness ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_7:1.0000:Let me put on thy glorious dress :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_8:1.0000:And then with those, in realms divine ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_9:1.0000:As sun's immortal ever shine !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_10:1.0000:The full and true resemblance, we
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_11:1.0000:Shall bear to him eternally ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_12:1.0000:Who did at first create this world,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_13:1.0000:But now ten thousand are unfurl' d !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_14:1.0000:Each in extatic joy to share,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_15:1.0000:What Christ did for his own prepare ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_16:1.0000:And feast upon the golden store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_17:0.9750:For ever, and for ever more !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_21:0.9750:' The cradle and the tomb ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_22:1.0000:The three score years and ten have been,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_23:0.9750:To me a transient home !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_24:1.0000:But yesterday it seems to be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_25:1.0000:That when a child at play ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0207_26:0.9500:My heart was eclat, full of glee :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_1:0.9500:The space between the two extremes,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_2:0.9750:(Youth, and the hoary head,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_3:1.0000:Is fill'd with harsh, or pleasant dreams.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_4:1.0000:But now, the vision's fled !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_5:1.0000:These grief worn, furrow'd cheeks of mine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_6:0.9750:Conve}- the briny tear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_7:1.0000:From those dim eyes, which used to shine.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_8:0.9750:So brilliant and so clear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_9:1.0000:Sometimes I cast a novel glance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_10:1.0000:On former business done ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_11:1.0000:And view the things of time and chance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_12:1.0000:Which now are past and gone.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_13:1.0000:My limbs with age so feeble grow,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_14:0.9750:The silv'ry tresses wave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_15:1.0000:Across the forehead, white as snow ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_16:0.9750:And I, am nigh the grave.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_17:0.9750:My days are swifter than the post,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_18:1.0000:Or weaver's shuttle fled !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_19:1.0000:My time is either won or lost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_20:1.0000:When number' d with the dead.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_21:1.0000:Reflections on the past, to me
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_22:1.0000:Present a humid shade,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_23:0.9750:And shew me what I ought to be.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_24:1.0000:Ere in the dust I'm laid.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_25:1.0000:The privilege to life and bliss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_26:0.9750:Could I live o'er again :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_27:0.9750:(To me, Montgomery stated this ;)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_28:0.9750:Should not be spent in vain !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_29:1.0000:But, ah ! the day is past, and I
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_30:0.9750:Shall gather up my feet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_31:1.0000:Prepar'd or not, must surely die,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0208_32:0.9500:My father's God to meet !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_1:1.0000:And thus, no trace is left behind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_2:1.0000:Our days are few and short ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_3:1.0000:A span, a waft, a gust of wind !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_4:1.0000:Which cannot pass for naught.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_5:1.0000:The brevity of life is such,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_6:1.0000:Our actions on the stage ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_7:1.0000:Will stamp, and validate the touch.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_13:1.0000:Excepting that of love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_14:1.0000:So worthy to the manly breast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_15:0.9750:Of ev'ry gen'rous soul ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_16:1.0000:Who entertains the honor'd guest,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_17:1.0000:And drinks the sapient bowl !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_18:0.9750:But self, seducer of the young.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_19:0.9500:The aged and infirm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_20:1.0000:Will undermine with double tongue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_21:0.9750:And make the calm a storm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_22:0.9500:" All languages ('tis said) she speaks,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_24:1.0000:Where self in every thing she seeks,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_25:0.9500:And aggrandizes none.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_26:1.0000:On this small pivot turns the wheel,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0209_27:0.9750:Alone for int'rest sake ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_1:0.9750:Will sew, and knit, and spin, and reel,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_2:0.9750:And all advantage take ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_3:1.0000:Of friends or foes, no matter what
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_4:1.0000:The characters he meet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_5:1.0000:Where interest is, will move the hat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_6:1.0000:To rob, betray, and cheat.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_7:1.0000:He seems to love,* tho' hatred is
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_8:1.0000:Within his selfish heart ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_9:1.0000:Thence issues forth the pleasing phiz,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_10:1.0000:To cast a poison'd dart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_11:1.0000:By turns the knave, and honest man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_12:1.0000:Receive his feign 'd applause ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_13:1.0000:Who takes advantage where he can,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_14:0.9750:And thus self-int'rest goes. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_18:1.0000:For life, and health, and pleasure,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_19:0.9500:May happen shortly be your end,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_20:0.9750:And then, where is your treasure ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_21:1.0000:Let truth and honesty, attend
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_22:1.0000:Your every act in life ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_23:1.0000:That each may have a trusty friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_24:1.0000:In husband, child, or wife.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_25:1.0000:But if your kindred cannot blend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0210_26:1.0000:Their int'rest with you, here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_1:1.0000:You have a good and honest friend,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_2:0.9500:Within a conscience clear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_3:1.0000:And void of all offence to man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_4:1.0000:From every sin apart ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_5:1.0000:According to the golden plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_6:0.9750:Well grounded in your heart.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_13:0.9750:Eternal happiness to share-
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_14:1.0000:Forever with the blest ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_15:1.0000:The clay is mould' ring in the tomb,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_16:1.0000:From which the spirit's fled !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_17:1.0000:And now hath landed safe at home,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_18:0.9750:With Christ, its living head.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_19:0.9750:By whom, the message he obtain'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_20:0.9750:To preach salvation here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_21:1.0000:Full fifty years, while strength remain' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_22:1.0000:He blew the trumpet clear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_23:0.9750:Thus, long and loud, the gospel sound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_24:1.0000:From honor'd lips was heard !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0211_25:1.0000:By thousands, who the spirit found
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_1:1.0000:And shall I say, the trophies, of
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_2:1.0000:The vict'ry that is won ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_3:1.0000:By the atonement made in love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_4:0.9500:To see them, " Newton's" gone ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_5:1.0000:Yes, absent from the body, he
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_6:1.0000:Is present with the Lord ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_7:1.0000:Where all the sons of God shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_8:1.0000:Reaping their grand reward !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_12:1.0000:Returning to its rest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_13:1.0000:Behold the convoy Jesus sent !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_14:1.0000:To guard the spirit home,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_15:1.0000:'Mid pleasure, peace, and true content,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_16:1.0000:In flow'ry meads to roam.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_17:1.0000:Where silv'ry streams of light and love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_18:0.9750:Flow sweetly through the air ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_19:1.0000:In golden channels, far above :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_20:1.0000:And ah ! is " Newton" there ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_21:0.9500:Chanting, in songs the most sublime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_22:1.0000:Loud praises to the Lamb !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_23:0.9750:In yon delightful heav'nly clime,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_24:0.9500:Where dwells the great I Am !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_26:0.9500:To all his children dear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_27:1.0000:The Book of life is now unseal' d,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_28:0.9750:And " Newton" reads it clear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_29:0.9750:With millions more, in garments bright,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_30:0.9500:Who bear the stamp divine :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0212_31:0.9750:In fields of bliss, and realms of light.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_1:0.9750:Ah ! let me die the death of those,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_2:1.0000:Who live so righteous here :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_3:1.0000:That when this mortal life shall close,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_4:1.0000:I may in heaven appear !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_11:1.0000:Where sounds Jehovah's voice.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_12:1.0000:All splendid, beautiful, and fair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_13:1.0000:In pristine lustre glow !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_14:1.0000:The saints shall breathe salubrious air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_15:0.9750:Wafted on all below.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_16:1.0000:While every shrub, and plant, disclose
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_17:1.0000:Their colour, shade, or hue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_18:1.0000:The desert blossom's as the rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_19:1.0000:The world is made anew !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_20:1.0000:And all the sons of God shall sing,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_21:1.0000:(While every heart is free,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_23:0.9500:" Who died on Calvary."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_24:0.9500:With joy, and gladness, each shall come,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0213_26:0.9750:Nor e'er a discoid to benumb,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_3:1.0000:" To hear the sound of Jesu's voice,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_4:0.9750:No countenance is sad.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_6:1.0000:('Mid Sharon's balmy sweets,)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_7:0.9750:And shall forever-more endure —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_8:1.0000:This song, the " rose" repeats !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_9:0.9750:The excellence of God is here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_10:0.9500:" The glory of the Lamb !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_11:1.0000:No doubt, despair, distress, or fear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_13:1.0000:Hark ! " strengthen ye the weak" he saith,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_14:1.0000:Confirm the feeble knee ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_15:1.0000:Ye fearful hearts be strong in faith,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_16:1.0000:For Christ shall make you free.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_17:1.0000:The eyes of those who once were blind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_18:0.9500:Shall see the glory of
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_19:0.9750:Their " Saviour," merciful and kind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_20:1.0000:The essence of true love.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_21:1.0000:The lame, and halt, shall leap for joy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_22:0.9750:The dumb shall sing his praise ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_23:1.0000:And nothing can their peace destroy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_24:0.9750:Or mar their lovely lays.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_25:1.0000:A pool the parched ground shall be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_26:0.9500:And springs of water rise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_27:1.0000:Out of the same, in harmony ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_28:0.9750:"With earth, and air, and skies.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_29:0.9500:Where reeds, and rushes ever grew,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_30:0.9750:And dragons used to lay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_31:1.0000:The grass is green, with splendid hue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0214_32:0.9750:And flow'rs in grand display.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_1:1.0000:The path of holiness is here,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_2:1.0000:The King's highway indeed !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_3:1.0000:Where all is beautiful and clear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_4:1.0000:The captive soul is free'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_5:1.0000:" No rav'nous beast, or lion" now,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_6:1.0000:Are in the " garden" found,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_7:1.0000:Where fruits eternal, ever grow —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_8:1.0000:This spot is hallow' d ground !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_9:1.0000:The man wayfaring, tho' a fool,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_10:1.0000:Hath vanquish' d all his foes ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_11:1.0000:By dipping in " Bethesda's pool !"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_12:0.9750:He rests in sweet repose.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_14:0.9750:To Zion's lovely hill"—
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_15:1.0000:With songs of praise, nor ever mourn ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_16:1.0000:To do his sovereign will.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_17:1.0000:Ah ! blessed state, " let me aspire,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_18:1.0000:To Zion's holy mount ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_19:1.0000:No more on earth do I require,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_20:1.0000:While sipping at the fount.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_21:1.0000:Where springs eternal ever rise
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_22:1.0000:The fountain of all bliss !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0215_24:0.9750:As well as us, in this.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_5:1.0000:Who wink at Nature, and detest
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_6:1.0000:To pay her legal fee's.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_7:1.0000:Reproach, and obloquy may prey
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_8:1.0000:Upon their mind and will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_9:1.0000:In objurgatory display;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_10:1.0000:Behold them winking still.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_11:1.0000:Puff'd up with arrogance and pride.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_12:0.9750:In self-conceited rank,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_13:1.0000:Are all. in all ; and nought beside !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_14:1.0000:Mankind are but a blank.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_15:1.0000:Some, doubtless have acquired much,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_16:0.9750:By science and by art,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_17:0.9750:Which gives to pride a double touch ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_19:1.0000:The Physiologist knows well
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_20:1.0000:What merits his esteem !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_21:1.0000:Tho', art may teach him how to spell ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_22:1.0000:Yet Nature, is his theme.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_23:1.0000:He casts his eye across the deep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_24:1.0000:While mountain billows roll !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_25:1.0000:Their true diurnal motion keep ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_26:1.0000:And lash from pole to pole.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_27:1.0000:Thus, in rotary march progress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_28:0.9750:Nor art or force control ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0216_29:1.0000:At times, they seem as in distress,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_1:0.9750:But no, it cannot, cannot be ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_2:1.0000:Omnipotence is there !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_3:0.9750:Whose word alone commands the sea,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_4:1.0000:And every breath of air. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_5:1.0000:Now take the landscape at a glance,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_6:1.0000:Behold its varied hue !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_7:1.0000:And tell me, has it come by chance r
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_8:0.9750:Or eve, or morning dew.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_9:1.0000:Then take a view above your reach,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_10:1.0000:On yon most splendid span !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_11:0.9750:Which stands a monument to preach
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_12:0.9500:A sermon unto man!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_13:0.9750:This arch is bas'd upon the Flood,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_14:0.9500:(Prognostic, surely firm ;)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_16:1.0000:Most brilliant in the storm !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_17:0.9750:A token of good-will to man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_19:1.0000:Tho' he, to wisdom, counter ran,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_20:0.9500:And rais'd a long dispute.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_21:1.0000:Nature's sublimity is wrought,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_22:1.0000:Man can't materialize !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_23:1.0000:Or shew magnificence by naught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_24:1.0000:As did " the only wise."
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_25:1.0000:Behold the splendour of the Sun,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_26:1.0000:Progressing in his march,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_27:0.9500:Whose work is never, never done,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_29:1.0000:'Mid rains descending to the earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_30:0.9500:The same to fructify ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_31:0.9750:No shrub, or plant, but feels the worth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0217_32:0.9500:Of Him, who cannot die. —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_2:1.0000:In winter, these may lay ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_3:1.0000:God's goodness never can abate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_4:1.0000:Behold the Summer's day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_5:1.0000:Fruitful, and fertilizing all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_6:1.0000:Beneath th' ethereal sky,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_7:1.0000:Arise from sleep, and at his call,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_8:1.0000:Our varied wants supply.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_9:1.0000:The Maker's signature is giv'n,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_10:1.0000:On every blade of grass !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_12:1.0000:Hath brought these things to pass.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_13:1.0000:For man's convenience, and dare he
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_14:1.0000:Attempt to mutilate ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_15:1.0000:Or mar, what was design' d to be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_16:1.0000:A permament estate ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_17:1.0000:Of all the splendour nam'd above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_18:1.0000:This truth none can excel ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_19:1.0000:Man is the object of his love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_20:1.0000:Who deigns with him to dwell !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_21:1.0000:For why ? the spark of heav'nly flame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_22:1.0000:Within his bosom reigns !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_23:1.0000:And all he has in Jesu's name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_25:1.0000:True bliss on earth, thrice blest in heaven !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_26:1.0000:No higher bliss can be ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_27:1.0000:When this to man is freely given,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0218_28:1.0000:He's bless'd eternally ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_6:1.0000:While blooming delightfully stand,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_7:1.0000:And fragrant perfumes issue forth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_8:1.0000:The lily and daisy the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_9:0.9750:Tho' trampled on by the beast ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_10:1.0000:And many more sweets I could name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_11:1.0000:Are given to it now to feast —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_12:1.0000:But woman's the loveliest flower
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_13:0.9750:That Nature alone can produce !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_14:1.0000:Her beauty may fade in an hour ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_15:1.0000:Yet she is for man's special use.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_16:1.0000:And this was ordained at first,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_17:1.0000:A union that naught should divide ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_18:1.0000:For man without a woman, is lost ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_19:1.0000:But hark, he has got a young bride !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_20:1.0000:Now she close by his side here sits,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_21:1.0000:And they two united in one ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_22:1.0000:With influence over his wits,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_23:1.0000:Without whom, he'd little or none.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_24:1.0000:Ye buxom, attend to the news,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_25:1.0000:And listen to what I shall say ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_26:1.0000:No man of good sense will abuse,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_27:1.0000:The partner, and bliss of his day!
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_28:1.0000:Some virtues of her I will state ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0219_29:0.9750:Altho' it is out of my power
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_1:0.9500:The fullest extent to relate,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_2:1.0000:Of nature's immaculate flower !*
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_3:1.0000:What could he then do without her ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_4:1.0000:Whose tongue, has a musical sound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_5:1.0000:When you are deep sunk in demur,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_6:1.0000:It will raise your head above ground.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_7:1.0000:All cunning can never divide
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_8:0.9750:The part, and the parcel of man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_9:1.0000:For she, is the rib of his side ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_10:1.0000:The bond, in the union ran.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_11:1.0000:Tho' he, be the master of arts,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_12:0.9750:Endowed with physical power ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_13:1.0000:Yet, what is the head without parts ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_14:0.9500:And what is the stem, to the flower ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_15:0.9750:Man needn't to set himself up,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_16:0.9750:So very much out of his place ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_17:1.0000:They must both partake of one cup :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_18:1.0000:And never think this a disgrace.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_19:1.0000:But just the reverse now is it,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_20:1.0000:The fairest of fair for to meet ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_21:1.0000:Here, close by her side, thus to sit,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_22:1.0000:And at the same table to eat.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_23:1.0000:Then take a walk, or ride in the air,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_24:1.0000:Enjoying the sweets of the day ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_25:1.0000:To the loveliest bow'rs repair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_26:1.0000:And that, in the sunshine of May.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_28:1.0000:On subjects about men and things ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_29:1.0000:Where amorous love cannot break
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0220_30:1.0000:The bough with the musical strings.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_1:1.0000:What shall I say more of the sex ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_2:1.0000:To shew you the worth of the same ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_3:1.0000:Just keep her in tune, she'll not vex,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_4:1.0000:But raise you to eminent fame.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_5:1.0000:When sick and infirm, she will keep,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_6:1.0000:And do for you all that she can ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_7:1.0000:Yea, sooth you to rest in a sleep !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_8:1.0000:All this will she do for her man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_9:1.0000:How, then, can we value too much.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_10:1.0000:This blessed and heavenly boon ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_11:1.0000:Ye Buxom, who haven't got such.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_12:1.0000:Must strive to look after it soon.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_13:1.0000:For, if you the season let slip.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_14:1.0000:You never may have it again ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_15:1.0000:Nor can you along with her trip.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_16:1.0000:But may have to wander in pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_17:1.0000:If you ask a reason, I'll give it :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_20:0.9750:That Adam should not be alone !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_21:0.9750:A help-meet so handsomely fair !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_22:0.9500:Surprisingly fitted to man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_24:0.9750:And wisdom conducted the plan !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_25:1.0000:Thus, thus is the miracle done ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_26:0.9750:Cemented together by love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_27:0.9500:The two are united in one !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_28:1.0000:And blend in the fountain above.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_29:0.9750:There's something mysterious in this !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_30:0.9500:When man from his happiness fell,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0221_31:0.9750:T' restore him to permanent bliss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_1:1.0000:But here is the touchstone and drill,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_2:0.9750:Our Maker, caus'd her to give birth
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_5:0.9500:Had it not been for this, we were lost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_6:1.0000:And lost, we should ever remain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_7:1.0000:The blood of our Saviour it cost,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_8:1.0000:To expiate sorrow and pain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_9:0.9750:Mark ! Woman's the instrument given
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_10:0.9750:To Man, in the product of seed :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_11:1.0000:Which shall rise the lump by the leaven,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_12:0.9750:That all may deliciously feed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_13:1.0000:This, this is my subject and theme ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_14:1.0000:So honor'd and dignifi'd, she,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_15:1.0000:Who merits the highest esteem,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_16:1.0000:In which you must ever agree.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_17:1.0000:To dwell with each other on earth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_18:0.9750:In the sweetest harmonica, love ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_19:1.0000:Nor know the extent of their worth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_20:1.0000:Till they find the secret above.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_21:1.0000:Now take it for granted that we,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_22:1.0000:Have a right to admire the flower !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_23:1.0000:And pluck it where ever it be,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_24:1.0000:And plant it afresh in the bower !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_27:1.0000:Of all the horrid, deadly blows,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0222_28:0.9750:Struck and received by the foes
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_1:0.9750:For ever let this passion cease ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_2:1.0000:And in its place, true love, and peace
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_4:1.0000:To all eternity !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_5:1.0000:For why one be another's slave ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_6:1.0000:Or why the vassal of a knave ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_7:0.9750:Can this be valiant, noble, brave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_8:1.0000:To fetter human souls ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_9:0.9750:Wherever man imposes this,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_10:1.0000:He's sure to find things all amiss ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_11:1.0000:And in the end lose future bliss,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_13:1.0000:True Britons can't monopolize
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_14:1.0000:The thing which makes the foolish, wise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_15:1.0000:Freedom, with dignity they prize,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_16:0.9750:Who spread it far and wide ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_17:0.9750:Let this be clearly understood ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_18:0.9750:Mankind are all of human blood,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_19:0.9750:United thus in brotherhood,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_20:0.9750:Nor can it be deni'd.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_21:0.9500:By climate, skins, in colour vary,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_22:0.9750:And Esau like, whose hide was hairy ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_24:0.9500:Yet each have got a soul,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_25:1.0000:And that's the standard of the man !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_27:1.0000:Or alter from its Author's plan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_29:1.0000:As sun's immortal man shall rise !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0223_30:0.9500:If like the " Virgins (who were wise,")
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_2:1.0000:Jesu's peculiar choice !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_3:0.9500:Let each contribute to the same.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_4:1.0000:By fanning up the mental flame ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_5:1.0000:To shine in honor of his name,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_7:1.0000:Behold the Potentate on high !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_8:1.0000:Who laid his prestine glory by,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_9:0.9750:All carnal weapons to defy ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_10:1.0000:By perfect love alone.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_11:1.0000:Whose own example thus he gave,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_12:1.0000:To liberate the bonded slave ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0224_13:0.9750:By princely valour bold and brave :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_21:1.0000:^ c;ND can the essence of the rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_22:1.0000:My languid frame revive ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_23:1.0000:By application to the nose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_24:1.0000:Where sense is just alive.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_25:1.0000:The statement's true, yet more I'll bring
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_26:0.9750:As moral, pure and clean ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0225_27:0.9750:Its lustre doth outshine the King !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_1:0.9750:The rose, with her I must compare ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_2:1.0000:When man is woman's friend :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_3:1.0000:No care or trouble will she spare,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_4:1.0000:For him she'll make and mend.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_5:1.0000:The roses flush upon the cheek,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_6:1.0000:The modest placid eye ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_7:0.9750:A reciprocity will seek,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_8:0.9750:Which nought but love can buy.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_9:1.0000:Whose countenance is quite serene,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_10:1.0000:With heart devoid of guile ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_11:1.0000:Her features speak the thing I mean,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_12:0.9500:In one delightful smile !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_13:1.0000:A true resemblance of the Rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_14:0.9500:Without duplicity ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_15:1.0000:Such handsome graces here disclose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_17:1.0000:Nor ostentatious in display,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_18:1.0000:Upon the bough to bend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_19:1.0000:And breathe its fragrant life away,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_20:1.0000:In virtue of its friend.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_21:1.0000:Superbly more than this, I see,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_22:1.0000:The intellectual eye !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_23:1.0000:Which rolls in love, for ever free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_24:1.0000:A gem ! which cannot die.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_25:1.0000:Whose excellence we can't create,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_26:1.0000:Nor yet the boon destroy ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0226_27:1.0000:'Twill bloom, and blossom, in a state
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_4:0.9750:Which stamps on him a tenfold worth,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_5:1.0000:The help-mate at a call.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_6:0.9750:" In every state of life to join,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_7:1.0000:With true simplicity ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_8:1.0000:Nor over reach, or yet purloin,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_9:0.9500:To aid felicity.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_10:1.0000:And then in fecundity, they
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_11:1.0000:A progeny shall have ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_12:1.0000:With pow'rs of mind, in grand display.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_13:0.9750:And sentiment so brave.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_14:1.0000:That when the wind with fury blows ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_15:1.0000:Their standard cannot lower ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_16:1.0000:As every leaf within the rose,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_17:1.0000:Presents a lovely flower.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_19:0.9500:Now testify its worth ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_20:0.9750:" The rose of Sharon !"* is the first
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_21:0.9500:In splendour shining forth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_22:0.9750:With unique magnanimity,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0227_23:1.0000:And lustre undefin'd !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_3:0.9750:The last rose of summer, and first in the train,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_4:0.9500:To draw the rest forward, with him to remain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_11:0.9750:Was toss'd about by wind and storm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_12:0.9750:And in the midst his courage fail'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_13:1.0000:When reft of anchor sure and firm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_14:1.0000:While on the sea where mountain billows bound,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_15:1.0000:And hope so far away from solid ground.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_16:0.9750:Mark, in the fourth watch of the night,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_17:1.0000:When dark and dreary, the look out ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_18:0.9750:His mates, with him beheld a sight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_19:1.0000:Which thus created fear and doubt.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_21:0.9500:Nor could they find one moment's peace or rest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_23:0.9750:Quite full of mercy, truth, and power ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_24:1.0000:Approaching thus, to set them free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_25:1.0000:Now, in their most distressing hour.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0228_26:0.9750:Whom when they saw, cried trem'rously in fear !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_1:0.9750:But hark ! a voice call'd loud and clear,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_2:1.0000:Cheer up, " 'tis I ! be not afraid ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_3:1.0000:Then Peter's hope reviv'd to steer
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_4:0.9500:His course along the dreary shade :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_6:1.0000:He answer'd thus unto his master, Lord !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_7:1.0000:Is't thou ? then bid me come to thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_8:1.0000:I'll venture, if thou give command ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_9:1.0000:I'll walk upon the raging sea,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_10:0.9500:As firmly, as on solid land !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_11:1.0000:Then lo ! sweet Jesus now, his faith to try,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_12:0.9750:Bid Peter come, (while he was drawing nigh.)
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_13:0.9750:Forthwith he left the ship, and all
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_14:1.0000:His mates on board, to tread the deep ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_15:1.0000:And thus obey'd his master's call,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_17:0.9750:But soon he fail'd of hope's connecting link ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_18:0.9750:By boist'rous winds appal'd, began to sink.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_19:1.0000:Thus then, he cried unto his Lord,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_20:1.0000:" O save me," or I perish here ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_21:1.0000:Can'st thou not now, thy help afford ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_22:0.9750:While I'm in danger doubt and fear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_23:1.0000:Jesus stretch'd forth his arm omnipotent !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_24:1.0000:And sav'd poor Peter, who was nearly spent.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_26:0.9750:Hath footing sure and firm enough ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_27:0.9750:As love in mercy set him free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_28:0.9500:And calm'd the raging storm so rough !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0229_29:0.9750:When landed where his mates were all on board ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_4:1.0000:While we upon the Ocean sail,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_5:1.0000:With life boat of the soul.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_6:1.0000:" Jesus our Captain," now on board,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_7:1.0000:Is always at the helm ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_8:1.0000:With vessel theet, and richly stor'd,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_9:1.0000:Which nothing can o'erwhelm.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_12:1.0000:When Jesus took him by the arm,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_13:0.9750:And brought him into bliss.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_14:1.0000:Where all exclaim' d in truth thou art,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_16:1.0000:With sole possession of the chart,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_17:0.9750:The compass and the rod.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_18:1.0000:Wherewith to govern and control,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_19:1.0000:The massive universe ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_20:1.0000:Both land and seas, from pole to pole,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_21:1.0000:Thy signal pow'r rehearse.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_22:0.9750:And shall we mortals, doubting, say
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_23:1.0000:Thine arm is weak and short ?
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0230_24:1.0000:Witness the hand, without delay,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_1:1.0000:If little faith, produced such !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_2:0.9750:An increase must do more ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_3:1.0000:Lord, with thy wand, my spirit touch ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_4:1.0000:And grant me all thy store.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_5:1.0000:Then shall I live by faith on thee,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_6:1.0000:Tho' death obstruct my way :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_7:1.0000:The passage still, to heaven is free ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_8:1.0000:And faith shall win the day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_9:1.0000:The day for which all other days,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_10:0.9750:All other days were made :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_11:1.0000:Wherein to sing thy endless praise,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_12:1.0000:And never retrograde.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_13:1.0000:Ah, " blessed state ! may this be mine,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_14:1.0000:To reign with thee above !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_15:1.0000:And in thy lovely image shine,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_16:1.0000:Nor life-boat e'er remove.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_17:1.0000:Then shall I brace my music string,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_18:1.0000:And sound its sweetest note !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_19:1.0000:When Thou dost me to glory bring,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_21:1.0000:Where the ship's company shall meet,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_22:1.0000:Whose hearts with love are fraught,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_23:1.0000:And every soul in songs repeat,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0231_24:0.9750:Christ our salvation bought !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_6:0.9750:Which gender grief and pain ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_7:1.0000:To thinking minds they're but pest.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_8:1.0000:In melancholy strain.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_9:0.9750:Enough of which, by Nature, we
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_10:1.0000:Are subject to, without
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_11:0.9750:The lamentable tragedy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_12:0.9750:In mimicarian flout.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_13:0.9750:Such carping songs would soon destroy
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_14:1.0000:The lovely, active mind ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_15:1.0000:Sweet peace, and comfort, hope, and joy,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_16:0.9750:Would into atoms grind !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_17:1.0000:Vain lamentations then deplore,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_18:1.0000:With all their kindred drear ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_19:1.0000:Who'd rob you of your precious store,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_20:1.0000:And leave you bound in fear.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_21:1.0000:Distress, and grief, with fell despair,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_22:0.9750:And all the catalogue,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_23:0.9750:Of melancholy thought, and care,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_25:1.0000:Then rise, above th' demoniac clan,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_26:1.0000:With all their train of evil ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_27:1.0000:Which never was design'd for man,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0232_28:0.9500:But fitted for the Devil.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_3:1.0000:Just leave him to himself ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_4:1.0000:Or else he'll fix you in a plight,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_5:1.0000:And pop you on the shelf.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_6:1.0000:Where he can have you at a call ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_7:0.9500:When you are not aware
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_8:1.0000:He'll snap the prop, and down you fall,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_9:1.0000:In endless, deep despair ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_14:1.0000:And practice the harmonic breed.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_15:1.0000:As evil propensities gender the same,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_16:1.0000:The best are most likely to be
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_17:1.0000:A comfort to man, and will raise him to fame,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_18:0.9750:While he with the same can agree.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_19:0.9750:Discontent with a Providence wide of the mark,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0233_21:0.9750:Is like the old Cur, that delights in a bark ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_1:1.0000:Whose council from the word of God,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_2:1.0000:Is drawn by faith and prayer ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_3:1.0000:Will never use the whipping rod,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_4:0.9500:When he the rod can spare.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_5:0.9750:" If words when softly spoken, turn
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_6:0.9750:The wrath of man away ;"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_7:1.0000:Let every Parent calmly learn
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_8:1.0000:Their Children, to obey.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_9:1.0000:AVhile soft and ductile is the mind,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_10:1.0000:Impression must be made ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_11:1.0000:Or else in after years you find,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_12:1.0000:The wrong foundation laid.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_13:1.0000:And then the work you cannot mend ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_14:0.9500:The sturdy stubborn Oak,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_15:1.0000:Thus grown mature, is hard to bend :
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_16:1.0000:And passion bad to balk.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_17:1.0000:Base virulence is fix'd thereby,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_18:1.0000:Which nothing can remove ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_19:1.0000:Unless you resolutely try,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_20:1.0000:The strongest passion, love !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_21:1.0000:Which must o'ercome the violent rage
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_22:0.9750:Of every surly blast,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_23:0.9750:Attacking man, from youth to age,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_24:1.0000:And often binds him fast.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_25:0.9750:Altho' the system once was found
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_26:1.0000:Replete, with light and truth !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_27:1.0000:Yet, wisdom knows that folly's bound
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_28:1.0000:Within the heart of youth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_29:1.0000:But when the rule prescrib'd above,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_30:0.9750:Is practis'd while in youth ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_31:1.0000:'Twill every evil thence remove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0234_32:0.9750:And reinstate the truth.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_2:1.0000:The hoary head shall crown
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_3:1.0000:His lengthen'd years, in free good-will,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_4:0.9750:The flow'r is fully clown !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_5:1.0000:Diffusing sweets on all around ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_6:1.0000:The leaves of which must fall ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_7:1.0000:And mingle with their native ground,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_8:1.0000:Yet, love " is all in all ! —
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_9:1.0000:And shall survive the rack of worlds,"
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_10:1.0000:When matter dies away ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_11:1.0000:Its beauty more, and more unfurls,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_12:1.0000:Through one eternal day !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_13:1.0000:And then, the Father's lovely smile,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_14:1.0000:In permanence shall last v
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_15:1.0000:Not for a short and transient while,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_16:1.0000:But when all time is pass'd !
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_17:1.0000:Where light, and life, and truth, and love,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_18:1.0000:Spring, present and to come ;
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_19:1.0000:Recipients then shall doubtless prove,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0235_20:0.9500:The Father's smile at home.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0236_5:0.9500:All the birds were delighted, contented and free,
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0236_8:0.9500:As the scene so transporting, in nature complete.
fifthworkoforigi00wrig_0236_11:0.9500:bowl ;

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_21:0.9500:With maniac laughter joined;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_22:0.9750:How fearful were these signs displayed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_23:1.0000:By pangs that killed the mind!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_24:0.9750:And when at length the drear and long
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_26:0.9500:How plaintively thy mournful song
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_27:0.9750:Upon the still night rose!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_28:0.9750:I've heard it oft as if I dreamed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_29:0.9500:Far distant, sweet and lone,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_30:0.9500:The funeral dirge it ever seemed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_31:0.9500:Of reason dead and gone.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_32:0.9750:To drink its strains I've stole away,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_36:0.9750:Air held her breath; trees with the spell
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_40:0.9750:But this is past, and naught remains
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0028_41:0.9500:That raised thee o'er the brute:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_4:0.9500:Hast lost the power to know.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_34:1.0000:Like a swift-flitting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_35:0.9500:The flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_37:1.0000:The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_38:0.9500:Be scattered around and together be laid;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0029_39:1.0000:And the young and the old, and the low and the high
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_2:0.9750:The mother that infant's affection who proved,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_3:0.9750:The husband that mother and infant who blest,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_4:0.9750:Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_5:1.0000:The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_9:0.9750:The hand of the king that the scepter hath borne,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_10:0.9500:The brow of the priest that the miter hath worn,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_12:0.9500:Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_13:0.9750:The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_14:0.9750:The herdsman who climbed with his goats up the steep,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_17:1.0000:The saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_18:1.0000:The sinner who dared to remain unforgiven,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_19:0.9500:The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_20:0.9750:Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_21:1.0000:So the multitude goes like the flower or the weed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_25:0.9500:For we are the same that our fathers have been;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_26:0.9750:We see the same sights our fathers have seen;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_27:0.9500:We drink the same streams, and view the same sun,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_32:0.9500:But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_33:0.9500:They loved, but the story we cannot unfold;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_39:0.9500:And make in their dwellings a transient abode,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_42:0.9750:Are mingled together in sunshine and rain:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0030_43:0.9500:And the smile and the tear, the song and the dirge,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_19:0.9500:Our fathers brought forth on this continent
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_21:0.9500:Conceived in liberty,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_22:0.9750:And dedicated to the proposition
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_23:1.0000:That all men are created equal.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_24:1.0000:Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_28:0.9500:We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_31:0.9500:For those who here gave their lives
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_33:0.9500:It is altogether fitting and proper
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_34:0.9500:That we should do this.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0033_44:0.9750:The world will little note nor long remember
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_3:0.9500:It is for us, the living, rather,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_4:0.9500:To be dedicated here to the unfinished work
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_5:0.9750:Which they who fought here have so nobly advanced.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_12:0.9750:That these dead shall not have died in vain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_14:0.9500:Shall have a new birth of freedom;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_15:0.9750:And that government of the people,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0034_16:0.9500:By the people, and for the people
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_34:1.0000:"'0 my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_35:1.0000:It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_37:1.0000:Though inclination be as sharp as will;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_38:1.0000:My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_41:1.0000:And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_42:1.0000:Were thicker than itself with brother's blood?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_43:0.9750:Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0037_44:0.9500:To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_1:0.9500:But to confront the visage of offence;

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_9:0.9500:My crown, my own ambition, and my queen.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_10:0.9750:May one be pardoned and retain the offence?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_12:0.9750:Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_13:1.0000:And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_14:1.0000:Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_18:0.9750:To give in evidence. What then? What rests?

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_20:0.9500:Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_22:0.9500:O bruised soul that, struggling to be free,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_36:0.9750:Made glorious summer by this sun of York,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0038_38:0.9500:In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.'
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_19:0.9750:A cabin of the western wild

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_21:1.0000:Nor nurse nor parent dear can know
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_22:1.0000:The way those infant feet must go,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_23:1.0000:And yet a nation's help and hope
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_24:1.0000:Are sealed within that horoscope.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_25:1.0000:Beyond is toil for daily bread,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_26:1.0000:And thought to noble issues led.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_27:1.0000:And courage, arming for the morn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_28:1.0000:For whose behest this man was born.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_29:1.0000:A man of homely, rustic ways,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_30:1.0000:Yet he achieves the forum's praise
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_31:1.0000:And soon earth's highest meed has won,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0048_32:0.9750:The seat and sway of Washington.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_1:1.0000:No throne of honors and delights,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_2:1.0000:Distrustful days and sleepless nights,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_3:1.0000:To struggle, suffer and aspire,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_4:1.0000:Like Israel, led by cloud and fire.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_5:1.0000:A treacherous shot, a sob of rest,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_6:1.0000:A martyr's palm upon his breast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_7:1.0000:A welcome from the glorious seat
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_8:1.0000:Where blameless souls of heroes meet.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_9:1.0000:And thrilling, through unmeasured days,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_10:1.0000:A song of gratitude and praise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_11:1.0000:A cry that all the earth shall heed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_12:0.9750:To God, who gave him for our need.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_16:0.9750:Their strong, broad limbs in shelter overhead
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_17:1.0000:When tempest storms, protecting all below.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_19:1.0000:Rose from the soil, with all its virgin power
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_20:1.0000:Emplanted in him for the fateful hour,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0049_21:0.9500:When he might brood a Nation in its strife.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_18:0.9750:A child was born to poverty and toil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_19:1.0000:Save in the sweet prophecy of mother's love
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_20:1.0000:None dreamed of future fame for him!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_21:0.9750:'Mid deep privation and in rugged toil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_22:1.0000:He grew unschooled to vigorous youth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_23:1.0000:His teaching was an ancient spelling book,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_26:1.0000:And out of these, stretched by the hearthstone flame
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_27:0.9750:For lack of other light, he garnered lore
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_28:1.0000:That filled his soul with faith in God.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_29:1.0000:The prophet's fire, the psalmist's music deep,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_30:1.0000:The pilgrims' zeal throughout his steadfast march,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_31:1.0000:The love of fellow man as taught by Christ,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0051_32:0.9750:And all the patriot faith and truth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_2:0.9500:And there, in all his after life, in thought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_3:1.0000:And speech and act, resonant concords were in his great
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_5:0.9750:And, God's elect, he calmly rose to awful power,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_6:1.0000:Restored his mighty land to smiling peace,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_7:1.0000:Then, with the martyr blood of his own life,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_8:1.0000:Baptized the millions of the free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_9:0.9750:Henceforth, the ages hold his name high writ
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0052_10:0.9500:And deep on their eternal rolls.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_9:0.9750:NO choir celestial sang at Lincoln's birth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_11:0.9750:In honor of some ancient prophecy,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_12:1.0000:No augury was given from heaven or earth.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_14:0.9500:A rare, sweet flower of heaven that ne'er should die,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_15:0.9750:Altho' the vase in which it grew should lie
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_16:1.0000:Most rudely rent amid the darkling dearth.

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_19:1.0000:Where wealth had never pressed its greedy feet,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0053_20:1.0000:Where honor, pomp or fame found no retreat;

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0055_3:0.9750:heaven, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0055_4:1.0000:The first He taught the music of the spheres,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0055_6:1.0000:And, loving, wise, and just beyond our dream,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0055_7:0.9750:The third a pilot made upon the New World's stream.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0055_8:0.9500:Their work is done, but ere they crossed "the portal,"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_19:1.0000:SON of the Western World! whose heritage
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_21:1.0000:Whose callow thoughts with wings untrammeled
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_24:1.0000:Naught couldst thou know of place or precedent,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_25:1.0000:For Freedom's ichor with thy mother's milk
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_26:1.0000:Coursing thy veins, would render thee immune
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_27:1.0000:To Fashion's dictate, or prescriptive creed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_28:1.0000:Leaving thy soul unhindered to expand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_31:1.0000:Like all great souls with version unobscured
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_33:1.0000:The gray and sombre way by Duty marked;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0056_34:0.9750:Seeking the springs of Wisdom, un allured
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_1:1.0000:By shallower sources which the witless tempt.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_2:1.0000:Afar o'er arid plains didst thou behold
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_3:1.0000:An empty sky, and mountains desolate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_4:1.0000:Barring thy way to fairer scenes beyond;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_5:1.0000:But faith was thine, and patience measureless,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_6:0.9750:Making thee equal to thy destiny.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_8:1.0000:It summons to our vision all thy life,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_9:1.0000:Of strenuous toil; the cabin low and rude;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_10:1.0000:The meagre fare; the blazing logs whose glow
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_11:1.0000:Illumed the pages of inspired bards,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_13:1.0000:The darkling forest where thy ringing axe
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_14:1.0000:Chimed with the music of the waterfall;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_15:1.0000:The eager flood bearing thy rugged raft
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_16:1.0000:Swift footed through an ever changing world
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_17:1.0000:Unknown to thee save in remembered dreams.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_19:0.9750:We see thee in the mart where Selfishness
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_20:0.9750:For Fame ephemeral strives, and sordid gain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_21:1.0000:Thy ill-requited toil till thou hadst earned
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_22:1.0000:The right to raise thy potent voice within
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_23:1.0000:A nation's forum, facing all the world;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_24:0.9750:And then, achievement such as few have known,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_25:1.0000:A mighty people placing in thy hand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_26:0.9750:A sceptre swaying half a continent,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_27:1.0000:Making thee peer of kings and potentates;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_28:0.9750:Aye, greater than them all, whate'er their power.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_30:1.0000:But, lo! the martial camp; the bivouac;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_31:1.0000:The rude entrenchment; — the grim fortalice;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_32:1.0000:The tented field; — the flaming battle line,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0057_33:1.0000:And thy great soul amidst it all unmoved
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_1:0.9500:By petty aims, leading with flawless faith
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_2:0.9750:Thy people to a promised land of peace;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_3:1.0000:And, then, when thou hadst reached the goal of hope,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_4:0.9500:And the world stood amazed, the heavy crown
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_5:0.9500:Of martyrdom was pressed upon thy brow
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_6:0.9500:And thy immortal course was consummate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_8:1.0000:In all great souls God sows with generous hand

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_12:1.0000:And thou, who didst the shining heights attain
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_13:1.0000:Of unsurpassed achievement, didst but pay
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_14:1.0000:The impartial toll of souls like thine required.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0058_15:0.9500:And we, who on the narrow marge of Time
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0061_6:1.0000:A heart of fire,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0061_22:1.0000:Our praise, our tears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0061_24:0.9500:Through the nation's years.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0061_26:1.0000:Our tears, our praise;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_5:1.0000:Who shrank from nothing new,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_6:0.9750:But did as poor men do.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_7:0.9750:One of the people. Born to be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_8:0.9750:Their curious epitome,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_9:1.0000:To share, yet rise above,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_10:0.9750:Their shifting hate and love.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_11:1.0000:Common his mind, it seemed so then,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_12:1.0000:His thoughts the thoughts of other men,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_13:1.0000:Plain were his words, and poor —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_14:0.9750:But now they will endure.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_15:1.0000:No hasty fool of stubborn will,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_16:1.0000:But prudent, cautious, still —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_17:1.0000:Who, since his work was good,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_18:1.0000:Would do it as he could.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_19:1.0000:No hero, this, of Roman mold —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_20:0.9750:Nor like our stately sires of old.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_21:1.0000:Perhaps he was not great —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_22:1.0000:But he preserved the state.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_23:1.0000:O, honest face, which all men knew,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_24:1.0000:O, tender heart, but known to few —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_25:1.0000:O, wonder of the age,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0063_26:0.9500:Cut off by tragic rage.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_12:0.9500:To read the books he liked the best
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_13:0.9500:Beside the cabin fire.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_14:1.0000:God's word and man's; — to peer sometimes
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_15:1.0000:Above the page, in smoldering gleams,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_16:1.0000:And catch, like far heroic rhymes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_17:0.9750:The onmarch of his dreams.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_18:1.0000:A peaceful life; — to hear the low
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_19:1.0000:Of pastured herds,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_20:1.0000:Or woodman's axe that, blow on blow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_21:1.0000:Fell sweet as rhythmic words.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_22:1.0000:And yet there stirred within his breast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_23:1.0000:A faithful pulse, that, like a roll
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_24:1.0000:Of drums, made high above his rest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_26:1.0000:A peaceful life! — They hailed him even
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_29:1.0000:When prayers nor aught availed.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_30:1.0000:And lo, he paid the selfsame price
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_31:1.0000:To lull a nation's awful strife
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_32:1.0000:And will us, through the sacrifice
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0065_33:0.9500:Of self, his peaceful life.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_14:0.9500:Bending to the settler's ways
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_15:1.0000:Yon poor youth whom now we praise-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_16:0.9750:Romance like the fairies?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_17:0.9750:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_18:0.9750:Leader of his people.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_19:0.9750:Saw you in the days of youth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_20:1.0000:By the candle's flaring:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_21:1.0000:Lincoln searching for the truth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_22:0.9750:Splitting rails to gain, forsooth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_23:0.9500:Knowledge for the daring?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_24:0.9750:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_26:0.9500:Saw you in his manhood's prime
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_27:0.9750:Like a star resplendent,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_28:0.9750:Him we praise with measured rhyme
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_29:0.9750:Waiting for the coming time
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_30:0.9750:W'ith a faith transcendent?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0066_31:1.0000:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_1:0.9500:Saw you in the hour of strife
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_2:1.0000:When fierce war was raging,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_3:1.0000:Him who gave the slaves a life
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_4:0.9750:Full and rich with freedom rife,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_5:1.0000:All his powers engaging?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_6:0.9750:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_7:0.9500:Leader of his people.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_8:0.9500:Saw you when the war was done
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_9:0.9750:(Such is Lincoln's story)
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_10:0.9750:Him whose strength the strife had won
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_11:0.9500:Sinking like the setting sun
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_12:1.0000:Crowned with human glory?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_13:0.9750:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_14:0.9750:Leader of his people.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_15:0.9750:Saw you in our country's roll
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_16:1.0000:Midst her saints and sages,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_17:0.9750:Lincoln's name upon the scroll —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_18:1.0000:Standing at the topmost goal
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_19:1.0000:On the nation's pages?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_20:1.0000:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_21:0.9500:Leader of his people.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_22:1.0000:Hero! Yes! We know thy fame;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_23:1.0000:It will live forever!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_24:1.0000:Thou to us art still the same;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_25:1.0000:Great the glory of thy name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_26:1.0000:Great thy strong endeavor!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_27:0.9750:Hero! Hero! Sent from God!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0067_28:0.9500:Leader of his people.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_17:0.9500:L^ncouth, if only city ways refine;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_18:0.9750:Ungodly, if 'tis creeds that make divine;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_19:1.0000:In station poor, as judged by human rules,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_20:1.0000:And yet a giant towering o'er them all;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_21:1.0000:Clean, strong in mind, just, merciful, sublime;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_22:1.0000:The noblest product of the age and time,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_23:0.9750:Invoked of God in answer to men's call.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_24:1.0000:O simple world, and will you ever learn,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_25:1.0000:Schools can but guide, they cannot mind create?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_27:0.9500:In meanest forms we priceless gems discern;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_28:0.9750:Nor time, nor age, condition, rank nor birth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0069_29:1.0000:Can hide the trulv noble of the earth.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_16:0.9750:A picture of pain and care;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_17:0.9750:A lawyer sat with his greatest brief,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_18:1.0000:High in his office chair.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_19:0.9750:His Country was to him client!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_21:1.0000:And he must plead 'fore Fate's high court,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_22:1.0000:With prayer, and pen, and sword.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_23:1.0000:Elected, by his people!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_24:0.9500:His heart and theirs, one beat!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_25:1.0000:He sees the storm-clouds gather;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_26:1.0000:The waves dash at his feet!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0071_27:1.0000:Gloom upon land and water!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_3:1.0000:And still the lawyer sat dreaming
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_5:0.9500:Then, '61! Dark! Silent!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_9:1.0000:Writing the Message that ever
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_10:1.0000:Shall live in the hearts of men;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_11:1.0000:With cannon to cannon fronting,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_12:0.9750:The lawyer held the pen.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_13:0.9500:Only thinking of Country
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_14:1.0000:And the work that must be done;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_15:0.9750:Nature made in roughest mold
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_16:1.0000:Her favored, fated son.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_17:1.0000:He wrote while the world was waiting
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_19:1.0000:Should, or should not Democracy
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_21:1.0000:Should Liberty at last survive
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_22:1.0000:And man look straight on man?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_23:1.0000:Law, in its round, its strength and might
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_24:1.0000:Be timed unto sense and plan?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_25:1.0000:He, in his chair there sitting,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_26:1.0000:Had all these things for thought.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_27:0.9750:Now, the Vote unrecognized,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0072_28:1.0000:Must battles wild be fought?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_2:1.0000:To remind the Land of the time
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_3:1.0000:When the Slaver's heart, all passion,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_4:1.0000:He planned, and pursued his crime!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_5:1.0000:As he rushed Disunion's order,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_6:1.0000:On, on from State to State!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_7:1.0000:And the Pen talked loud down the Message,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0073_8:0.9500:And bided the Land to wait.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_21:0.9750:A master-voice is ever singing, singing,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_23:1.0000:In young America's song,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_24:1.0000:As threatening tumult pierced the tensioned air,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_26:0.9750:The love of brother-man.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_27:0.9750:And still his voice is heard;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_28:1.0000:'Twill pierce the din of strife and mystery,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0075_29:0.9500:Till master-voices cease their singing, singing,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_15:0.9500:THE angels of your thoughts are climbing still
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_17:0.9750:And have not reached the top, nor ever will,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_18:1.0000:While this low life pronounces his high name.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_19:0.9750:But yonder, where they dream, or dare, or do,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_20:0.9750:The "good" or "great" beyond our reach,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_21:1.0000:To talk of him must make old language new
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0077_22:0.9500:In heavenly, as it did in human, speech.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_16:0.9500:That brow all wisdom, all benignity;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_19:0.9750:That spirit fit for sorrow, as the sea
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_20:1.0000:For storms to beat on; the lone agony
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_21:1.0000:Those silent, patient lips too well foretold.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_22:0.9750:Yes, this is he who ruled a world of men
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_23:0.9750:As might some prophet of the elder day —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_24:0.9500:Brooding above the tempest and the fray
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_25:1.0000:With deep-eyed thought and more than mortal ken.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_26:0.9750:A power was his beyond the touch of art
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0079_27:0.9750:Or armed strength — his pure and mighty heart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_17:0.9500:IOOK on this cast, and know the hand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_19:0.9750:From this mute witness understand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_20:0.9750:What Lincoln was — how large of mold.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_21:1.0000:The man who sped the woodman's team,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_22:1.0000:And deepest sunk the plowman's share,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_23:1.0000:And pushed the laden raft astream,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_24:1.0000:Of fate before him unaware.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_25:1.0000:This was the hand that knew to swing
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_27:1.0000:Her son — and made the forest ring,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_28:1.0000:And drove the wedge and toiled amain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_29:1.0000:Firm hand that loftier office took,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_30:0.9750:A conscious leader's will obeyed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_31:1.0000:And, when men sought his word and look,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0081_32:1.0000:With steadfast might the gathering swayed.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_1:1.0000:No courtier's, toying with a sword,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_2:1.0000:Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_4:1.0000:When all the kings of earth are mute!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_5:1.0000:The hand of Anak, sinewed strong,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_6:1.0000:The fingers that on greatness clutch,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_7:1.0000:Yet lo! the marks their lines along
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_8:0.9750:Of one who strove and suffered much.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_9:1.0000:For here in mottled cord and vein
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_10:1.0000:I trace the varying chart of years,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_11:1.0000:I know the troubled heart, the strain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_12:0.9500:The weight of Atlas — and the tears.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_13:1.0000:Again I see the patient brow
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_14:1.0000:That palm erewhile was wont to press;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_15:0.9750:And now 'tis furrowed deep, and now
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_16:1.0000:Made smooth with hope and tenderness.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_17:1.0000:For something of a formless grace
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_18:1.0000:This molded outline plays about;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_19:1.0000:A pitying flame, beyond our trace,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_20:1.0000:Breathes like a spirit, in and out —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_21:1.0000:The love that casts an aureole
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_22:1.0000:Round one who, longer to endure,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_23:1.0000:Called mirth to cease his ceaseless dole,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_24:1.0000:Yet kept his nobler purpose sure.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_25:1.0000:Lo, as I gaze, the statured man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_26:1.0000:Built up from yon large hand, appears;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_27:1.0000:A type that nature wills to plan
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_28:0.9750:But once in all a people's years.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_29:1.0000:What better than this voiceless cast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_30:0.9750:To tell of such a one as he,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_31:1.0000:Since through its living semblance passed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0082_32:0.9750:The thought that bade a race be free?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_7:0.9500:OHARK! from the pine-crested hills of old Maine,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_9:0.9500:of the morning,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_10:0.9500:And away in the West, over river and plain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_11:1.0000:Rings out the grand anthem of Liberty's warning!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_12:0.9750:From green-rolling prairie it swells to the sea,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_13:0.9500:For the people have risen, victorious and free,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_16:1.0000:The spirit that fought for the patriots of old
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_17:1.0000:Has swept through the land and aroused us forever;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_18:1.0000:In the pure air of heaven a standard unfold
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_19:0.9750:Fit to marshal us on to the sacred endeavor!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_21:1.0000:Noble the hopes that encircle it there!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_22:1.0000:And where battle is thickest we follow the crest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_28:1.0000:Till their lessening columns oppose us no longer.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_30:0.9750:Through the struggles of years, and are victors at last;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0085_31:0.9500:So forward the flag! Leave to Heaven the rest,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_16:1.0000:UP again for the conflict! Our banner fling out,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_18:0.9500:Stout of heart, firm of hand, should the gal-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_19:0.9500:lant boys be,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_20:0.9500:Who bear to the battle the Flag of the Free!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_24:1.0000:And follow wherever she beckons them on,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_29:0.9750:From loom and from ledger, from workshop and farm,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_30:0.9750:The fearless of heart, and the mighty of arm.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0087_31:0.9750:As the mountain-born torrents exultingly leap
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0088_1:1.0000:Our Leader is one who, with conquerless will,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0088_2:0.9500:Has climbed from the base to the brow of the hill;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0088_3:0.9500:Undaunted in peril, unwavering in strife,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0088_6:0.9500:Is as firm as the rock and as true as the steel.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0088_8:0.9500:Then, hurrah, boys, for honest "Old Abe of the West!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_13:0.9750:YEA, this is he, whose name is synonym
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_14:0.9500:Of all that's noble, though but lowly born;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_15:0.9500:Who took command upon a stormy morn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_16:1.0000:When few had hope. Although uncouth of limb,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_17:0.9750:Homely of face and gaunt, but never grim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_18:0.9750:Beautiful he was with that which none may scorn —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_19:0.9750:With love of God and man and things forlorn,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_20:1.0000:And freedom mighty as the soul in him.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_21:1.0000:Large at the helm of state he leans and looms
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_22:1.0000:With the grave, kindly look of those who die
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_23:1.0000:Doing their duty. Stanch, unswervingly
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_24:1.0000:Onward he steers beneath portentous glooms,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_25:1.0000:And overwhelming thunders of the sky,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_26:1.0000:Till, safe in port, he sees a people free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_27:1.0000:Safe from the storm; the harbor-lights of Peace
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_28:0.9750:Before his eyes; the burden of dark fears
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_29:1.0000:Cast from him like a cloak; and in his ears
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_30:0.9750:The heart-beat music of a great release;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_31:0.9500:Captain and pilot, back upon the seas,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0090_32:0.9500:Whose wrath he'd weathered, back he looks with tears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_1:0.9750:Seeing no shadow of the Death that nears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_2:1.0000:Stealthy and sure, with sudden agonies.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_3:1.0000:So let him stand, brother to every man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_4:0.9750:Ready for toil or battle; he who held
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_5:1.0000:A Nation's destinies within his hand;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_6:1.0000:Type of our greatness; first American,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_7:1.0000:By whom the hearts of all men are compelled,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_8:0.9500:And with whose name Freedom unites our land.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_9:1.0000:He needs no praise of us, who wrought so well,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_10:1.0000:Who has the Master's praise; who at his post
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_11:1.0000:Stood to the last. Yet, now, from coast to coast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_12:1.0000:Let memory of him peal like some great bell,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_13:1.0000:Of him as woodsman, workman, let it tell!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_14:1.0000:Of him as lawyer, statesman, without boast!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_15:1.0000:And for what qualities we love him most,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_16:1.0000:And recollections that no time can quell.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_17:1.0000:He needs no praise of us, yet let us praise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_18:1.0000:Albeit his simple soul we may offend,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_19:1.0000:That liked not praise, being most diffident;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_20:1.0000:Still let us praise him, praise him in such ways
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_21:1.0000:As his were, and in words that shall transcend
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0091_22:0.9500:Marble, and outlast any monument.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_11:0.9750:FROM out the ranks of common men he rose —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_13:0.9750:As in a wood of different species grows
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_14:1.0000:Above all other trees the lordly pine,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_15:1.0000:Upon whose branches rest the winter snows,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_16:1.0000:Upon whose head warm beams of summer shine;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_17:0.9750:His was the heart to feel the people's woes
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_18:1.0000:And his the hand to hold the builder's line;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_19:0.9750:Strong, patient, wise and great,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_22:1.0000:Will tower aloft unto commanding height
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_23:1.0000:As if more distant view abroad to seek —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_24:0.9500:First one to hail, last one to speed the light;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_25:0.9750:Those granite sides will snows of winter streak
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_26:1.0000:E'en in the summer with their purest white; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_27:0.9500:Silent, serene, that summit yet will speak
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_28:0.9750:Of loftiest grandeur to the enraptured sight;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0093_29:1.0000:So Lincoln's greatness shone
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_12:0.9750:And still could soften to the gentler lines
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_13:0.9750:Of one whose tenderness and truth went free
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_14:1.0000:Beyond the pale of any small confines
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_15:1.0000:To understand and help humanity.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_16:1.0000:Wise, steadfast mind, that grasped a people's need,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_17:1.0000:Counting nor pain nor sacrifice too great
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_18:1.0000:To keep the noble purpose of his creed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_20:1.0000:Though no least solace sprang of work or deed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_21:0.9500:For him, since triumph came at last — too late.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_22:1.0000:Brave, weary heart, that beat uncomforted
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_23:1.0000:Beneath its heavy load of grief and care;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_24:1.0000:That tears of blood for every battle shed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_25:1.0000:Yet called on mirth to help his comrades bear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_26:1.0000:The waiting hours of anguish, and that sped
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_27:1.0000:With loyal haste each breath of balm to share.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_28:1.0000:Only his people's griefs were his; no part
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_29:1.0000:Had he within their joy; nor his the toll
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_30:1.0000:To know the love that made rebellion start,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_31:1.0000:Spurred hosts unnumbered to a higher goal;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0095_32:0.9750:That his great soul should cleanse a nation's heart,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_3:0.9500:\/ I From the long-cherished home I go,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_6:1.0000:I go, to take the helm of State,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_7:1.0000:While loud the waves of faction roar,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_8:0.9750:And by His aid, supremely great,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_9:1.0000:Upon whose will all tempests wait,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_10:1.0000:I hope to steer the bark to shore.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_11:1.0000:Not since the days when Washington
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_12:1.0000:To battle led our patriots on,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_13:1.0000:Have clouds so dark above us met,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_14:1.0000:Have dangers dire so close beset.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_15:1.0000:And he had never saved the land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_16:0.9750:By deeds in human wisdom planned,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_17:1.0000:But that with Christian faith he sought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_18:1.0000:Guidance and blessing, where he ought.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_19:1.0000:Like him, I seek for aid divine,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_20:1.0000:His faith, his hope, his trust, are mine.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_21:1.0000:Pray for me, friends, that God may make
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_22:1.0000:My judgment clear, my duty plain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_23:1.0000:For if the Lord no wardship take,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_24:0.9750:The watchmen mount the towers in vain."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_25:1.0000:He ceased; and many a manly breast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_26:1.0000:Panted with strong emotion's swell,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_27:1.0000:And many a lip the sob suppressed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_28:1.0000:And tears from manly eyelids fell.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_29:1.0000:And hats came off, and heads were bowed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_30:1.0000:As Lincoln slowly moved away;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_31:1.0000:And then, heart-spoken, from the crowd,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0100_32:1.0000:In accents earnest, clear, and loud,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_28:0.9500:HARK to the sound that speedeth o'er the land!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_30:1.0000:'Tis duty calls thee, Lincoln, and thy trust
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_31:0.9750:Demands that all thy acts be wise and just.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_32:1.0000:No idle task to thee has been assigned,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_33:1.0000:But work that's worthy of a giant mind —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0104_34:1.0000:And on the issue hangs the nation's fame
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0105_3:1.0000:So, walk thou in the way the fathers trod;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0105_4:1.0000:Be true to freedom, country, and to God;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0105_5:1.0000:Then truth will triumph, treason be undone,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0105_6:1.0000:And thou be hailed the second Washington.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_19:0.9750:She bent the strenuous Heavens and came down
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_20:1.0000:To make a man to meet the mortal need.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_21:1.0000:She took the tried clay of the common road —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_22:0.9500:Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_23:1.0000:Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_24:1.0000:Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_25:1.0000:It was a stuff to wear for centuries,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_26:1.0000:A man that matched the mountains, and compelled
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_27:1.0000:The stars to look our way and honor us.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_28:0.9750:The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_29:1.0000:The tang and odor of the primal things —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_30:0.9750:The rectitude and patience of the rocks;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_31:1.0000:The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_32:1.0000:The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_33:1.0000:The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_34:1.0000:The pity of snow that hides all scars;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0108_35:0.9750:The loving-kindness of the wayside well;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_1:1.0000:The tolerance and equity of light
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_2:1.0000:That gives as freely to the shrinking weed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_3:1.0000:As to the great oak flaring to the wind —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_4:1.0000:To the grave's low hill as to the Matterhorn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_5:0.9750:That shoulders out the sky.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_6:1.0000:And so he came.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_7:1.0000:From prairie cabin up to Capitol,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_8:1.0000:One fair ideal led our chieftain on.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_9:1.0000:Forevermore he burned to do his deed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_10:1.0000:With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_11:0.9750:He built the rail pile as he built the State,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_12:1.0000:Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_13:0.9750:The conscience of him testing every stroke,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_14:1.0000:To make his deed the measure of a man.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_15:1.0000:So came the Captain with the mighty heart;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_17:1.0000:Wresting the rafters from their ancient hold,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_18:0.9750:He held the ridge-pole up and spiked again
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_19:0.9500:The rafters of the Home. He held his place —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_20:0.9500:Held the long purpose like a growing tree —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_21:0.9500:Held on through blame and faltered not at praise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_22:0.9750:And when he fell, in whirlwind, he went down
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_23:0.9750:As when a kingly cedar, green with boughs,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_24:0.9750:Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0109_25:1.0000:And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_6:1.0000:Our pastoral captain. Forth he came,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_7:0.9750:As one that answers to his name;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_8:0.9750:Nor dreamed how high his charge,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_9:1.0000:His work how fair and large,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_10:1.0000:To set the stones back in the wall
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_11:1.0000:Lest the divided house should fall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_12:0.9500:And peace from men depart,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_13:0.9500:Hope and the childlike heart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_14:0.9750:We looked on him; " 'Tis he," we said,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_15:0.9750:"Come crownless and unheralded,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_16:0.9750:The shepherd who will keep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_17:1.0000:The flocks, will fold the sheep."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_18:1.0000:Unknightly, yes; yet 'twas the mien
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_19:1.0000:Presaging the immortal scene,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0111_20:0.9750:Some battles of His wars
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_1:1.0000:Not he would take the past between
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_2:0.9750:His hands, wipe valor's tablets clean,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_3:0.9500:Commanding greatness wait
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_4:1.0000:Till he stands at the gate;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_5:0.9500:Not he would cramp to one small head
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_6:1.0000:The awful laurels of the dead,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_7:0.9500:Time's mighty vintage cup,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_8:0.9500:And drink all honor up.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_9:1.0000:No flutter of the banners bold
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_10:1.0000:Borne by the lusty sons of old,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_12:0.9500:Set forward to their wars;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_13:1.0000:Not his their blare, their pageantries,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_14:1.0000:Their goal, their glory, was not his;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_15:1.0000:Humbly he came to keep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_16:1.0000:The flocks, to fold the sheep.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_17:1.0000:The need comes not without the man;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_18:1.0000:The prescient hours unceasing ran,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_19:1.0000:And up the way of tears
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_20:0.9500:He came into the years.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_21:1.0000:Our pastoral captain, skilled to crook
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_22:1.0000:The spear into the pruning hook,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0112_23:0.9500:The simple, kindly man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_6:1.0000:Olden among the modern seats of prayer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_7:1.0000:Dark like the 'sixties, place and past akin.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_8:1.0000:All else has changed, but this remains the same,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_11:0.9750:Mixt faith and anguish melting into prayer
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_12:1.0000:Upon the burning altar of God's fane,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_13:1.0000:A nation's altar even as his own.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_14:0.9500:Where Lincoln prayed! Such worshipers as he
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_16:0.9500:His spirit suppliant? Then must thou feel
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_17:0.9500:War's fiery baptism, taste hate's bitter cup,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_18:0.9750:Spend similar sweat of blood vicarious,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_19:0.9750:And sound the cry, "If it be possible!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_20:0.9750:From stricken heart in new Gethsemane.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_21:1.0000:Who saw him there are gone, as he is gone;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_22:0.9500:The pew remains, with what God gave him there,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0115_23:0.9500:And all the world through him. So let it be —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_14:1.0000:A godlike manhood be his mighty dower!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_15:1.0000:Such and so gifted, Lincoln, may'st thou be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_16:0.9500:With thy high wisdom's low simplicity
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_17:1.0000:And awful tenderness of voted power.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_19:0.9750:On Time's calm ledger out of passionate days —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_20:0.9750:With the pure debt of gratitude begun,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_21:1.0000:And only paid in never-ending praise —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0117_22:1.0000:One of the many of a mighty land,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_5:0.9750:Tried in the lowest seat of all,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_6:0.9500:Tried in the chief seat of the house —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_7:1.0000:Lincoln! When men would name a man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_8:1.0000:Who wrought the great work of his age,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_9:1.0000:Who fought, and fought the noblest fight,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_10:1.0000:And marshalled it from stage to stage.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_11:1.0000:Victorious, out of dusk and dark,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_12:1.0000:And into dawn and on till day,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_13:1.0000:Most humble when the pseans rang,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_14:1.0000:Least rigid when the enemy lay
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_15:1.0000:Prostrated for his feet to tread —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_16:1.0000:This name of Lincoln will they name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_17:1.0000:A name revered, a name of scorn,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_18:1.0000:Of scorn to sundry, not to fame.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_19:1.0000:Lincoln; the man who freed the slave;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_20:0.9750:Lincoln, whom never self enticed;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0119_22:0.9750:A soldier of the captain Christ.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0121_34:0.9750:Owing naught to outward grace;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0121_35:0.9750:Yet, behind the rugged mien
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0121_36:0.9500:Were a mind and soul serene,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_1:0.9750:And in deep-set eyes there shone
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_2:1.0000:Genius that was all his own.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_3:0.9750:Humor quaint with pathos blent
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_4:1.0000:To his speech attraction lent;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_5:1.0000:Telling phrase and homely quip
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_6:1.0000:Falling lightly from his lip.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_7:1.0000:Eloquent of tongue, and clear,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_8:0.9750:Logical, devoid of fear,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_9:0.9750:Making plain whate'er was dense
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_10:1.0000:By the light of common sense.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_11:1.0000:Tender as the bravest be,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_14:0.9500:Led to grievous consequence;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_15:1.0000:Hating sham and empty show;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_16:1.0000:Chivalrous to beaten foe;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_17:1.0000:Ever patient in his ways;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_18:1.0000:Cheerful in the darkest days;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_19:1.0000:Not a demi-god or saint
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_20:1.0000:Such as fancy loves to paint,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_21:1.0000:But a truly human man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0123_22:1.0000:Built on the heroic plan.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_20:1.0000:Take the worn frame, that rested not
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_21:0.9750:Save in a martyr's grave;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_22:0.9750:The care-lined face, that none forgot,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_24:0.9750:Let man be free! The mighty word
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_25:0.9750:He spoke was not his own;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_26:0.9750:An impulse from the Highest stirred
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_27:0.9500:These chiseled lips alone.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0125_30:1.0000:And Xature, through his voice, denied
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_1:1.0000:We rest in peace where these sad eyes
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_2:1.0000:Saw peril, strife, and pain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_3:0.9750:His was the Nation's sacrifice,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_4:1.0000:And ours the priceless gain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_6:1.0000:As it is done above
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_7:0.9750:Bear witness to the cost and worth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_8:0.9750:Of justice and of love!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_9:0.9750:Stand in thy place and testify
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_10:1.0000:To coming ages long,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0126_11:1.0000:That truth is stronger than a lie,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_16:0.9750:There came a giant from the West,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_17:1.0000:And found a giant's work to do.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_18:1.0000:He saw, in sorrow — and in wrath —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_19:1.0000:A mighty empire in its strait,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_20:1.0000:Torn like a planet in its path
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_21:0.9500:To warring hemisphere of hate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_22:1.0000:Between the thunder-clouds he stood;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_23:1.0000:He harked to Ruin's battle-drum,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_24:1.0000:And cried in patriot hardihood,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_25:1.0000:"Why do I wait? My hour has come!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_26:0.9750:"Was it my fate, my lot, my woe
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_27:1.0000:To be the Ruler of the land,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_28:1.0000:Nor own my oath that long ago
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0128_29:1.0000:I swore upon this heart and hand?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_3:1.0000:Till brother's quarrels cease to be!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_5:1.0000:New strife in anger's zone
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_6:1.0000:The clash may be the penal stroke
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_7:1.0000:That makes a new Republic one."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_8:1.0000:He wrote his Message — clear as light,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_9:1.0000:And bolder than a king's command —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0129_10:0.9750:And when war's whirlwinds spent their might
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_3:0.9500:IINCOLN, that with thy steadfast truth the sand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_6:0.9750:And over all the pestilent southern land,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_7:1.0000:Breathless, the dark expectant millions stand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_8:1.0000:To watch the northern sun rise on its way,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_9:1.0000:Cleaving the stormy distance — every ray
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_10:0.9750:Sword-bright, sword-sharp, in God's invisible hand.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_11:0.9750:Better with this great end, partial defeat,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_12:1.0000:And jibings of the ignorant worldly-wise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_13:1.0000:Than laud and triumph won with shameful blows.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_15:1.0000:The living Present droops with tearful eyes;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0130_16:0.9500:But far beyond the awaiting Future glows.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_12:0.9750:As he issued the sublime command
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_13:0.9750:Let the enslaved be free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_14:1.0000:Ere long he saw the Bondmen rise;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_15:1.0000:Ere long as Freedmen seize the prize,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_16:0.9750:The precious boon of liberty.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_17:0.9500:A backward glance he cast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_18:1.0000:Into the valley of the past,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_21:1.0000:Out from the depths his upturned eyes
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_22:1.0000:Beheld the fleeing clouds the brighter skies.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_23:1.0000:Upon him shone a glory like the sun,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_24:0.9750:Reflecting "peace toward all, malice toward none."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_25:0.9500:As thus he filled his high exalted place,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_26:1.0000:The brave emancipator of a race,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_27:1.0000:He thought of the fierce struggle and the victory
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_28:0.9750:And humbly deemed himself to be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_29:0.9500:Only the instrument of a Divine decree.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0132_30:0.9500:Rejoicing in the faith of brighter coming days
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_4:1.0000:The exultant triumph of the right o'er wrong.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_6:1.0000:More than we asked, or hoped, or thought.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_7:1.0000:Through the "Red sea" of blood and carnage
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_8:1.0000:He brought our nation free of bondage.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_11:1.0000:That "He hath triumphed gloriously."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_12:1.0000:Oh why the sudden blotting out of light?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_13:1.0000:The cloud of sorrow, dark as Plutonian night,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_14:1.0000:That cast its lengthening shadow o'er the land;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_15:0.9500:Changing to funeral dirge the choral grand.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_16:1.0000:Swift as the typhoon's breath —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_17:1.0000:The harbinger of death —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_18:0.9750:The cruel deed of hate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_19:1.0000:Swept the grand chief away.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_20:1.0000:Unto this day, and ever aye,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0133_21:0.9500:The nation mourns her martvr's fate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_23:1.0000:What voice may fitly break
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_24:1.0000:The silence, doubly hallowed, left by him?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_25:1.0000:We can but bow the head, with eyes grown dim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_26:1.0000:And, as a Nation's litany, repeat
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_27:1.0000:The phrase his martyrdom hath made complete,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_28:1.0000:Noble as then, but now more sadly sweet:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_29:1.0000:"Let us, the Living, rather dedicate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_30:1.0000:Ourselves to the unfinished work, which they
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_31:1.0000:Thus far advanced so nobly on its way,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_32:1.0000:And saved the periled State!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_33:1.0000:Let us, upon this field where they, the brave,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_34:1.0000:Their last full measure of devotion gave,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0136_35:1.0000:Highly resolve they have not died in vain! —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_2:0.9750:Of freedom, and the people's gain
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_3:1.0000:Of their own Sovereignty, shall never wane
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_4:1.0000:And perish from the circle of the earth!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_5:1.0000:From such a perfect text, shall Song aspire
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_6:1.0000:To light her faded fire,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_7:1.0000:And into wandering music turn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_8:1.0000:Its virtue, simple, sorrowful, and stern?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_9:1.0000:His voice all elegies anticipated;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0137_10:1.0000:For, whatsoe'er the strain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_18:0.9750:Where lies the man in solitary state
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_19:1.0000:Who never caused a tear but when he died
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_20:1.0000:And set the flags around the world half-mast —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_22:0.9750:That e'en the utter avarice of Death
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_23:1.0000:That claims the world, and will not be denied,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_24:1.0000:Could only rob him of his mortal breath.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_25:1.0000:How strange the splendor, though the man be past!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_26:0.9500:His noblest inspiration was his last.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_27:0.9750:The statues of the Capitol are there.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_28:1.0000:As when he stood upon the marble stair
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_29:1.0000:And said those words so tender, true and just,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_30:1.0000:A royal psalm that took mankind on trust —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_31:0.9500:Those words that will endure and he in them,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_32:0.9500:While May wears flowers upon her broidered hem,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_33:0.9750:And all that marble snows and drifts to dust:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0138_34:0.9750:"Fondly do we hope, fervently we pray
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_2:0.9750:away:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_3:1.0000:With charity for all, with malice toward none,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_4:0.9750:With firmness in the right
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_5:0.9500:As God shall give us light,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_6:0.9750:Let us finish the work already begun,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_8:0.9500:Care for the helpless ones that they will leave behind,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_10:0.9750:A just and lasting peace, forever unto man!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_12:1.0000:When people strove as battle-clouds are driven,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_13:0.9500:One calm white angel of a day appears
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_14:1.0000:In every year a gift direct from Heaven,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_15:1.0000:Wherein, from setting sun to setting sun
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_16:1.0000:No thought of deed of bitterness was done.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_18:1.0000:Until perpetual peace flows like a river
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_19:1.0000:And hopes as fragrant as these tribute flowers
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0139_20:0.9500:Fill all the land forever and forever!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_11:1.0000:Swept at each army's head,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_12:1.0000:Swept to the charge and bled,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_14:0.9500:All woes, all pains;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_15:1.0000:The anguish of the trusted hope that wanes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_16:1.0000:The soldier's wound, the lonely mourner's smart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_17:1.0000:He knew the noisy horror of the fight,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_18:1.0000:From dawn to dusk and through the hideous night
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_19:0.9750:He heard the hiss of bullets, the shrill scream
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_22:0.9500:Like summer flowers, the pattering rain of death;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_23:0.9750:With every breath,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_24:1.0000:He tasted battle and in every dream,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_25:1.0000:Trailing like mists from gaping walls of hell,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0141_26:0.9500:He heard the thud of heroes as they fell.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0143_24:0.9500:van,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_2:0.9750:strong for the shock —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_3:1.0000:Fierce were the lightnings unleashed; in the midst, he
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_4:0.9750:stood fast as a rock.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_5:1.0000:Comrade he was and commander, he who was meant
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_6:0.9750:for the time,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_9:0.9500:like a breath,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_10:0.9750:Only some lives are immortal, challenging darkness
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_12:0.9500:Hewn from the stuff of the martyrs, write on the star-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_16:1.0000:Oh, man of many sorrows, 'twas your blood
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_19:1.0000:And Wilderness of ravenous Deaths that stood
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_21:0.9750:Your blood for those who won,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_22:0.9750:For those who lost, your tears!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_23:0.9750:For you the strife, the fears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_24:0.9500:For us, the sun!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_25:0.9500:For you the lashing winds and the beating rain in
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_29:1.0000:Oh, man of storms! Patient and kingly soul!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_30:0.9750:Oh, wise physician of a wasted land!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_31:1.0000:A nation felt upon its heart your hand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0144_32:0.9750:And lo, your hand hath made the shattered, whole,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_1:1.0000:With iron clasp your hand hath held the wheel
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_2:1.0000:Of the lurching ship, on tempest waves no keel
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_4:1.0000:A grim smile held your lips when strong men quailed.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_5:0.9750:You strove alone with chaos and prevailed;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_6:1.0000:You felt the grinding shock and did not reel,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_7:1.0000:And, ah, your hand that cut the battle's path
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_8:1.0000:Wide with the devastating plague of wrath,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_9:1.0000:Your bleeding hand, gentle with pity yet,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0145_11:0.9500:To bless, to succor, and to heal.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_21:0.9750:He walks with us in man's estate;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_22:1.0000:We know his was a brother heart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_23:1.0000:The marching years may render dim
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_24:0.9750:The humanness of other men;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_25:1.0000:Today we are akin to him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_26:1.0000:As they who knew him best were then.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_27:1.0000:Wars have been won by mail-clad hands,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_28:0.9750:Realms have been ruled by sword-hedged kings,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_29:0.9750:But he above these others stands
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_30:0.9750:As one who loved the common things;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_31:1.0000:The common faith of man was his,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_32:1.0000:The common faith of man he had —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_33:1.0000:For this today his grave face is
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0147_34:0.9750:A face half joyous and half sad.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_1:0.9750:A man of earth! Of earthy stuff,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_2:0.9750:As honest as the fruitful soil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_3:1.0000:Gnarled as the friendly trees, and rough
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_4:1.0000:As hillsides that had known his toil;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_5:1.0000:Of earthy stuff — let it be told,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_6:1.0000:For earth-born men rise and reveal
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_7:1.0000:A courage fair as beaten gold
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_8:1.0000:And the enduring strength of steel.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_9:1.0000:So now he dominates our thought.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_10:0.9750:This humble great man holds us thus
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_11:1.0000:Because of all he dreamed and wrought;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_12:1.0000:Because he is akin to us.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_13:1.0000:He held his patient trust in truth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_14:1.0000:While God was working out His plan,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_15:1.0000:And they that were his foes, forsooth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_16:1.0000:Came to pay tribute to the Man.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_17:1.0000:Not as the great who grow more great
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_18:1.0000:Until they have a mystic fame —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_19:1.0000:No stroke of fortune nor of fate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_21:1.0000:A common man, earth-bred, earth-born,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_22:1.0000:One of the breed who work and wait —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_23:1.0000:His was a soul above all scorn.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0148_24:0.9500:His was a heart above all hate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_12:0.9750:But soon the name was everywhere,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_13:0.9750:To be reviled and then revered:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_14:1.0000:A presence to be loved and feared,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_15:1.0000:We cannot hide it, or deny
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_16:1.0000:That we, the gentlemen who jeered,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_17:1.0000:May be fogotten by and by.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_18:1.0000:He came when days were perilous
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_19:1.0000:And hearts of men were sore beguiled;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_20:1.0000:And having made his note of us,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_21:1.0000:He pondered and was reconciled.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_22:0.9750:Was ever master yet so mild
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_23:0.9750:As he, and so untamable?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_24:1.0000:We doubted, even when he smiled,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_25:1.0000:Not knowing what he knew so well.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_26:1.0000:He knew that undeceiving fate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_27:1.0000:Would shame us whom he served unsought;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_28:1.0000:He knew that he must wince and wait —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_29:1.0000:The jest of those for whom he fought;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_30:1.0000:He knew devoutly what he thought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_31:1.0000:Of us and of our ridicule;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_32:1.0000:He knew that we must all be taught
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0150_33:0.9750:Like little children in a school.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_1:0.9750:We gave a glamour to the task
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_2:1.0000:That he encountered and saw through,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_3:1.0000:But little of us did he ask,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_4:1.0000:And little did we ever do.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_5:1.0000:And what appears if we review
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_6:1.0000:The season when we railed and chaffed?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_7:0.9750:It is the face of one who knew
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_8:0.9750:That we were learning while we laughed.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_9:1.0000:The face that in our vision feels
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_10:1.0000:Again the venom that we flung,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_11:1.0000:Transfigured to the world reveals
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_12:0.9750:The vigilance to which we clung.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_13:1.0000:Shrewd, hallowed, harrassed, and among
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_14:1.0000:The mysteries that are untold,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_15:1.0000:The face we see was never young
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_16:1.0000:Nor could it ever have been old.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_17:1.0000:For he, to whom we bad applied
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_18:1.0000:Our shopman's test of age and worth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_19:1.0000:Was elemental when he died,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_20:1.0000:As he was ancient at his birth:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_21:1.0000:The saddest among kings of earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_22:1.0000:Bowed with a galling crown, this man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_23:0.9750:Met rancor with a cryptic mirth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_24:0.9500:Laconic — and Olympian.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_25:1.0000:The love, the grandeur, and the fame
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_26:1.0000:Are bounded by the world alone;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_27:1.0000:The calm, the smouldering, and the flame
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_28:1.0000:Of awful patience were his own;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_29:0.9750:With him they are forever flown
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_30:1.0000:Past all our fond self-shadowings,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_31:0.9750:Wherewith we cumber the Unknown
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0151_32:0.9750:As with inept, Icarian wings.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_2:1.0000:For we were not as other men:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_3:0.9750:'Twas ours to soar and his to see.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_4:0.9750:But we are coming down again,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_5:1.0000:And we shall come down pleasantly;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_6:1.0000:Nor shall we longer disagree
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_7:1.0000:On what it is to be sublime,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0152_8:1.0000:But flourish in our perigee
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_4:1.0000:/■% Who held a warring nation in his heart;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_5:1.0000:^* ■** Who knew love's agony, but had no part
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_6:0.9750:In love's delight; whose mighty task was done
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_9:0.9750:Around him heirs of bliss, whose bright brows wear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_11:1.0000:Gaily they come, as though the drum
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_12:1.0000:Beat out the call their glad hearts knew so well;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_13:0.9750:Brothers once more, dear as of yore,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_14:1.0000:Who in a noble conflict nobly fell.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_15:0.9750:Their blood washed pure yon banner in the sky,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_16:0.9750:And quenched the brands laid 'neath these arches
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0153_17:0.9750:high —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_11:0.9500:SAD eyes that were patient and tender,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_13:0.9750:And warm with the unchanging splendor
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_14:1.0000:Of courage no ills could subdue!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_15:1.0000:Eyes dark with the dread of the morrow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_16:1.0000:And woe for the day that was gone,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_17:0.9750:The sleepless companions of sorrow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_18:0.9750:The watchers that witnessed the dawn.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_19:1.0000:Eyes tired from the clamor and goading
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_20:1.0000:And dim from the stress of the years,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_21:1.0000:And hallowed by pain and foreboding
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_22:1.0000:And strained by repression of tears.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_23:0.9750:Sad eyes that were wearied and blighted
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_24:1.0000:By visions of sieges and wars
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0155_25:1.0000:Now watch o'er a country united
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_13:0.9500:Of lagging war he kept his courage true.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_15:1.0000:But proved the faith of him who ever knew
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_17:0.9750:For our poor griefs, when never word nor deed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_18:0.9750:Of rancor, malice, spite, of low or great,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_19:1.0000:In his large soul one poison-drop could breed?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_20:1.0000:He leads us still. O'er chasms yet unspanned
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_21:1.0000:Our pathway lies; the work is but begun;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_22:0.9750:But we shall do our part and leave our land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_23:1.0000:The mightier for noble battles won.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_24:0.9750:Here Truth must triumph, Honor must prevail;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0157_25:0.9750:The nation Lincoln died for cannot fail!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_17:0.9750:Ever above, though ever near to earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_18:1.0000:Yet felt his heart the cruel tongues that sate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_19:1.0000:Base appetites and, foul with slander, wait
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_20:1.0000:Till the keen lightnings bring the awful hour
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_21:0.9750:When wounds and suffering shall give them power.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_22:0.9750:Most was he like to Luther, gay and great,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_23:1.0000:Solemn and mirthful, strong of heart and limb.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_24:1.0000:Tender and simple, too; be was so near
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_25:1.0000:To all things human that he cast out fear,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_26:1.0000:And, ever simpler, like a little child,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_27:1.0000:Lived in unconscious nearness unto Him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0159_28:1.0000:Who always on earth's little ones hath smiled.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_4:0.9500:On Pisgah's top our prophet died,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_5:0.9750:In sight of promised land.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_6:1.0000:Low knelt the foeman's serried fronts,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_7:1.0000:His cannon closed their lips of brass, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_8:1.0000:The din of arms hushed all at once
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_9:1.0000:To let this good man pass.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_10:0.9750:A cheerful heart he wore alway,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_11:1.0000:Though tragic years clashed on the while;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_12:0.9750:Death sat behind him at the play —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_13:1.0000:His last look was a smile.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_14:1.0000:No battle-pike his march imbrued,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_15:0.9750:Unarmed he went midst martial mails,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_16:1.0000:The footsore felt their hopes renewed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_17:1.0000:To hear his homely tales.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_18:1.0000:His single arm crushed wrong and thrall
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_19:1.0000:That grand good will we only dreamed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_20:0.9500:Two races wept around his pall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_22:1.0000:The trampled flag he raised again,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_23:1.0000:And healed our eagle's broken wing;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_24:1.0000:The night that scattered armed men
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0161_25:0.9750:Saw scorpions rise to sting.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_5:1.0000:Wailed loud the South with unremitting grief,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_6:0.9750:And wept the North that could not find relief.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_7:0.9750:Then madness joined its harshest tone to strife:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_8:0.9750:A minor note swelled in the song of life
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_9:1.0000:Till, stirring with the love that filled his breast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_10:1.0000:But still, unflinching at the Right's behest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_12:0.9750:The mighty Homer of the lyre of war!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_16:1.0000:And gave his spirit up in thund'rous song.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0163_17:1.0000:Oh, mighty Master of the mighty lyre!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_6:0.9500:Have fitly drawn their sheet of summer flowers!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_7:0.9750:What need hath he now of a tardy crown,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_8:0.9750:His name from mocking jest and sneer to save
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_9:0.9750:When every plowman turns his furrow down
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_10:1.0000:As soft as though it fell upon his grave?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_11:1.0000:He was a man whose like the world again
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_12:1.0000:Shall never see, to vex with blame or praise;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_13:1.0000:The landmarks that attest his bright, brief reign,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_14:1.0000:Are battles, not the pomps of gala days!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_15:1.0000:The grandest leader of the grandest war
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_16:1.0000:That ever time in history gave a place, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_17:1.0000:What were the tinsel flattery of a star
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_18:1.0000:To such a breast! or what a ribbon's grace!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_19:0.9500:'Tis to th' man, and th' man's honest worth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_20:0.9750:The Nation's loyalty in tears upsprings;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_21:1.0000:Through him the soil of labor shines henceforth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_22:1.0000:High o'er the silken broideries of kings.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_23:0.9750:The mechanism of eternal forms —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_24:1.0000:The shifts that courtiers put their bodies through —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_25:0.9750:Were alien ways to him: his brawny arms
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0165_26:0.9750:Had other work than posturing to do!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_6:1.0000:By the great heart, or keen and mighty mind;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_7:0.9750:There have been sufferers, maimed and halt and blind,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_12:0.9500:But who like thee, oh Sire! hath ever stood
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_13:0.9750:Steadfast for truth and right, when lies and wrong
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_14:0.9750:Rolled their dark waters, turbulent and strong;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_15:1.0000:^Yho bore reviling, baseness, tears and blood
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0167_16:0.9750:Poured out like water, till thine own was spent,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_4:0.9750:From shore to shore a nation keeps
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_6:0.9750:Though lowly born, the seal of God
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_7:1.0000:Was in that rugged face;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_8:1.0000:Still from the humble Nazareths come
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_9:0.9500:The Saviours of the race.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_10:1.0000:With patient heart and vision clear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_11:1.0000:He wrought through trying days — -
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_13:0.9750:Unswerved by blame or praise.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_14:1.0000:And when the morn of peace broke through
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_15:1.0000:The battle's cloud and din,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_16:1.0000:He hailed with joy the promised land,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_17:0.9500:He might now enter in.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_18:1.0000:He seemed as set by God apart,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_19:1.0000:The winepress trod alone;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_20:1.0000:He stands forth an uncrowned king,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_21:1.0000:A people's heart his throne.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_22:1.0000:Land of our loyal love and hope,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0169_24:1.0000:Bow down, renew today thy vows
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_25:1.0000:That God hath sown and planted here
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_27:1.0000:Let him take heart, throw off his fears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_28:0.9750:As he looks back a hundred years.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_29:1.0000:Cities and fields and wealth untold,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_30:0.9750:With equal rights before the law;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_31:1.0000:And, better than all lands and gold —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_32:0.9750:Such as the old world never saw —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_33:1.0000:Freedom and peace, the right to be,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0170_34:0.9750:And honor to those who made us free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_1:1.0000:Our greatness did not happen so,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_2:1.0000:We owe it not to chance or fate;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_3:1.0000:In furnace heat, by blow on blow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_4:1.0000:Were forged the things that make us great;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_5:0.9750:And men still live who bore that heat,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_6:1.0000:And felt those deadly hammers beat.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_7:1.0000:Not in the pampered courts of kings,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_8:1.0000:Not in the homes that rich men keep,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_9:1.0000:God calls His Davids with their slings,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_10:1.0000:Or wakes His Samuels from their sleep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_11:1.0000:But from the homes of toil and need
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_12:1.0000:Calls those who serve as well as lead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_13:1.0000:Such was the hero of our race;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_14:1.0000:Skilled in the school of common things,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_15:1.0000:He felt the sweat on Labor's face,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_16:1.0000:He knew the pinch of want, the sting
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_17:1.0000:The bondman felt, and all the wrong
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_18:1.0000:The weak had suffered from the strong.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_19:1.0000:God passed the waiting centuries by,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_20:1.0000:And kept him for our time of need —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_21:1.0000:To lead us with his courage high —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_22:1.0000:To make our country free indeed;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_23:1.0000:Then, that he be by none surpassed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_24:1.0000:God crowned him martyr at the last.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_25:1.0000:Let speech and pen and song proclaim
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_26:1.0000:Our grateful praise this natal morn;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_27:1.0000:Time hath preserved no nobler name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_28:1.0000:And generations yet unborn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0171_29:1.0000:Shall swell the pride of those who can
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_3:0.9500:SIC semper tyrannis!" the assassin cried,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_5:0.9750:More lived to set both slave and tyrant free?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_6:0.9500:Or so enrapt with plans of freedom died,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_9:0.9750:Win bloodless battles, and make that to be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_10:0.9500:Which to his living mandate was denied!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_11:1.0000:Peace to that gentle heart! The peace he sought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_12:1.0000:For all mankind, nor for it dies in vain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_13:0.9750:Rest to the uncrowned king, who, toiling, brought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_14:1.0000:His bleeding country through that dreadful reign;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_15:0.9500:Who, living, earned a world's revering thought,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0173_16:1.0000:And, dying, leaves his name without a stain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_4:0.9500:You, who with mocking pencil wont to trace,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_5:0.9500:Broad for self-complacent British sneer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_6:0.9750:His length of shambling limb, his furrowed face,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_8:1.0000:His garb uncouth, his bearing ill at ease,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_9:1.0000:His lack of all we prize as debonair,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_10:0.9750:Of power or will to shine, of art to please,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_11:0.9500:You, whose smart pen backed up the pencil's laugh,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_12:0.9750:Judging each step, as though the way were plain:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_13:1.0000:Reckless, so it could point its paragraph,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_14:1.0000:Of chief's perplexity, or people's pain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_15:1.0000:Beside this corpse, that bears for winding sheet
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_16:0.9500:The Stars and Stripes, he lived to rear anew,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_17:1.0000:Between the mourners at his head and feet,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_18:1.0000:Say, scurrile-jester, is there room for you?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_19:1.0000:Yes, he had lived to shame me from my sneer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_20:1.0000:To lame my pencil, and confute my pen —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_21:1.0000:To make me own this hind of princes peer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_22:1.0000:This rail-splitter a true-born king of men.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_23:1.0000:My shallow judgment I had learnt to rue,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_24:1.0000:Noting how to occasion's height he rose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0175_25:0.9750:How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_1:1.0000:How humble, yet how hopeful he could be;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_2:1.0000:How in good fortune and in ill the same;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_3:0.9750:Nor bitter in success, nor boastful he,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_4:1.0000:Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_5:1.0000:He went about his work — such work as few
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_6:1.0000:Ever had laid on head and heart and hand —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_7:0.9500:As one who knows, where there's a task to do,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_8:1.0000:Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace com-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_10:1.0000:Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_11:1.0000:That God makes instruments to work His will,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_12:0.9750:If but that will we can arrive to know,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_13:0.9750:Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_14:1.0000:So he went forth to battle, on the side
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_15:1.0000:That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_16:0.9500:As in his. peasant boyhood he had plied
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_17:0.9500:His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_18:0.9500:The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_19:1.0000:The iron-bark that turned the lumberer's axe,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_20:1.0000:The rapid, that o'erbears the boatmen's toil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_21:0.9750:The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_22:1.0000:The ambushed Indian, and the prowling bear —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_23:1.0000:Such were the needs that helped his youth to train;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_24:0.9500:Rough culture — but such trees large fruit may bear,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_25:1.0000:If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_26:1.0000:So he grew up, a destined work to do,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_27:0.9750:And lived to do it — four long-suffering years;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_28:1.0000:Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0176_29:0.9750:And then he heard the hisses change to cheers,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_2:0.9750:And took both with the same unwavering mood;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_3:0.9500:Till, as he came on light from darking days,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_4:1.0000:And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_5:0.9750:A felon hand, between the goal and him,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_6:0.9750:Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_7:0.9750:And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_8:1.0000:Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_9:1.0000:The words of mercy were upon his lips,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_10:1.0000:Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_11:0.9750:When this vile murderer brought swift eclipse
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_12:1.0000:To thoughts of peace on earth, good will to men.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_14:0.9500:Utter one voice of sympathy and shame!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_15:1.0000:Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_16:1.0000:Sad life, cut short just as its triumph came.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_17:1.0000:A deed accurst! Strokes have been struck before
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_18:0.9750:By the assassin's hand, whereof men doubt
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_19:0.9500:If more of horror or disgrace they bore;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_20:0.9500:But thy foul crime, like CAIN'S stands darkly out.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_21:0.9500:Vile hand, that brandest murder on a strife,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_22:0.9750:Whate'er its grounds, stoutly and nobly striven;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_23:1.0000:And with the martyr's crown crownest a life
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0177_24:0.9750:With much to praise, little to be forgiven!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_14:1.0000:Than these words that broke the silence: "He be-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_15:0.9500:longs now to the Ages!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_18:1.0000:He belongs, the years have shown it, to the world of
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_19:1.0000:human kind!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_20:0.9750:Heard his story, where'er hearts throb o'er the world's
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_25:1.0000:As they wander in the twilight, dreaming of their com-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_26:0.9750:ing homes;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_27:1.0000:Heard his story, statesmen tell it, with a thrill of pride
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_29:0.9500:Heard his story, old men speak it to the country's
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_31:1.0000:And the years have shown the Prophets, and the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0179_33:0.9500:Writ in fire these words of wisdom, "He belongs now
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_2:0.9750:LINCOLN had cause one man alone to hate:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_3:0.9500:A fellow-lawyer, lacking in all grace,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_4:1.0000:Who cast uncalled-for insult in his face
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_5:1.0000:When Lincoln as his colleague, with innate
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_7:1.0000:The scornful Stanton waved him to his place,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_8:1.0000:Snapping, "I need no help to try this case";
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_9:1.0000:And "cornfield lawyer" muttered of his mate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_10:1.0000:And when, as captain of the Union ship,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_11:1.0000:Lincoln drew sail before the gathering storm
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_12:0.9500:Till favoring winds the shrouds unfurled should fill,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_14:1.0000:And, with the impatience of a patriot warm,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_15:1.0000:Sneered at the helmsman, "craven imbecile."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_16:1.0000:Laid was the course at length; the sails untried
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_17:1.0000:Were spread; the raw crew set at spar and coil.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_18:1.0000:Now round the prow Charybdean waters boil
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_19:1.0000:And ever higher surges war's red tide.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_20:0.9750:The mate who should the captain's care divide
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_21:0.9750:Has strengthless proved. Where shall, the foe to foil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_22:0.9750:A man be found able to bear the toil
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_23:1.0000:And stand, to steer the ship, by Lincoln's side?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_24:1.0000:Stanton he called! The bitter choice he made
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_25:1.0000:For country, not himself. The ship was driven
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_26:1.0000:By the great twain through war's abyss, again
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_27:0.9500:Into calm seas. Then Lincoln low was laid,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_28:1.0000:And Stanton paid him highest tribute given
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0182_29:0.9750:To mortal: "Mightiest leader among men!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_19:0.9500:A% There hovers still, among the ruins lone,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_20:0.9500:"** The spirit of the Christ whose dying moan
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_21:1.0000:Was heard in heaven, and paid our debt in pain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_22:1.0000:As subtle perfume lingers with the rose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_23:1.0000:Even when its petals flutter to the earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_24:1.0000:So clings the potent mystery of the birth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_25:0.9750:Of that deep love from which all mercy flows.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_27:1.0000:Within this house, — this room, — a martyr died,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_28:1.0000:A prophet of a larger liberty, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_29:1.0000:A liberator setting bondmen free,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0185_30:1.0000:A full-orbed MAN, above mere mortal pride.

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_3:0.9750:As Christ's sweet influence broods upon the hill
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_4:1.0000:Where the red lily with the sunset fades.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_5:0.9750:A little girl with eyes of heavenly blue,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_6:1.0000:Sings through the old place, ignorant of all;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_7:0.9750:Her angel face, her cheerful, birdlike call
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_11:0.9500:FROM humble parentage and low degree
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_13:1.0000:None ever had a harder task than he,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_14:1.0000:It was perfected — him alone we thank.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_15:1.0000:Did the assassin think to kill a name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_16:1.0000:Or hand his own down to posterity?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_17:1.0000:One will wear the laurel wreath of fame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0186_18:1.0000:The other be condemned to infamy.

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_8:1.0000:The name of southerner with murderous gore!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_9:1.0000:Could such a spirit come from mortal womb?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_10:1.0000:And what possessed it that not heretofore
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_11:1.0000:It linked its coward mission with the tomb?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_12:1.0000:Lincoln! thy fame shall sound through many an age,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_13:1.0000:To prove that genius lives in humble birth;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_14:1.0000:Thy name shall sound upon historic page,

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0187_24:1.0000:He, like a lighthouse, fell athwart the strand;

poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_14:1.0000:More sweet his sleep for toil and sacrifice,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_15:1.0000:And that rare wisdom whose beginning lies
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_16:1.0000:In fear of God, and charity for man;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_17:1.0000:And sweetest for the tender faith that grew
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_18:0.9750:More strong in trial, and through doubt more clear,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_20:1.0000:In whose dread name the Nation's sword he drew.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_21:1.0000:Rest, rest for him; and rest for us today
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_22:0.9750:Whose sorrow shook the land from east to west
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_23:1.0000:When slain by treason on the Nation's breast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0191_24:0.9750:Her martyr breathed his steadfast soul away.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_7:0.9500:PEACE! Let the long procession come,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_10:1.0000:And, see! the awful car!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_11:1.0000:Peace! let the sad procession go,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_12:1.0000:While cannon boom, and bells toll slow:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_13:1.0000:And go, thou sacred car,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_14:1.0000:Bearing our Woe afar!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_16:1.0000:Whose loyal, sorrowing cities wait
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_17:1.0000:To honor all they can
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_18:1.0000:The dust of that good man!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_19:1.0000:Go, grandly borne, with such a train
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_20:1.0000:As greatest kings might die to gain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_22:1.0000:Attend thee to the grave!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_23:1.0000:And you the soldiers of our wars,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_24:1.0000:Bronzed veterans, grim with noble scars,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_25:0.9500:Salute him once again,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_27:1.0000:Yes, let your tears, indignant, fall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_28:1.0000:And leave your muskets on the wall;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_29:1.0000:Your country needs you now
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0193_30:0.9500:Beside the forge, the plow!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_2:0.9750:If Mercy may not stay her hand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_3:0.9750:Nor would we have it so —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_4:0.9750:She must direct the blow!)
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_5:1.0000:So, sweetly, sadly, sternly goes
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_6:0.9750:The Fallen to his last repose;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_7:0.9750:Beneath no mighty dome,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_8:0.9500:But in his modest Home!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_9:1.0000:The churchyard where his children rest,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_10:1.0000:The quiet spot that suits him best;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_11:1.0000:There shall his grave be made,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_12:1.0000:And there his bones be laid!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_13:1.0000:And there his countrymen shall come,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_14:1.0000:With memory proud, with pity dumb,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_15:1.0000:And strangers far and near,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_16:1.0000:For many and many a year!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_17:1.0000:For many a year, and many an age,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_18:0.9750:With History on her ample page
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0194_19:1.0000:The virtues shall enroll
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_13:0.9500:OH, slow to smite and swift to spare,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_16:1.0000:The sword of power, a nation's trust.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_17:1.0000:In sorrow by thy bier we stand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_18:1.0000:Amid the awe that hushes all,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_19:0.9750:And speak the anguish of a land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_20:1.0000:That shook with horror at thy fall.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_21:1.0000:Thy task is done; the bond is free —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_22:1.0000:We bear thee to an honored grave,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_23:1.0000:Whose noblest monument shall be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_24:1.0000:The broken fetters of the slave.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_25:1.0000:Pure was thy life; its bloody close
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_26:1.0000:Hath placed thee with the sons of light
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_27:0.9750:Among the noble host of those
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0195_28:1.0000:Who perished in the cause of right.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_14:0.9750:Gaze on that majestic sleep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_15:0.9750:Stand beside the bier to weep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_16:0.9750:Lay the gentle son of toil
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_17:1.0000:Proudly in his native soil;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_18:1.0000:Crowned with honor, to his rest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_20:1.0000:How cold the brow that yet doth wear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_21:1.0000:The impress of a nation's care;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_22:1.0000:How still the heart, whose every beat
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_23:1.0000:Glowed with compassion's sacred heat;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_24:1.0000:Rigid the lips, whose patient smile
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_25:1.0000:Duty's stern task would oft beguile;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_26:1.0000:Blood-quenched the pensive eye's soft light;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_27:1.0000:Nerveless the hand so loth to smite;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_28:1.0000:So meek in rule, it leads, though dead,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_29:1.0000:The people as in life it led.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_30:1.0000:O let his wise and guileless sway
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_31:0.9500:Win every recreant today,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_32:1.0000:And sorrow's vast and holy wave
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0197_33:0.9750:Blend all our hearts around his grave!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_1:0.9750:Let the faithful bondmen's tears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_2:1.0000:Let the traitor's craven fears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_3:0.9750:And the people's grief and pride,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_4:0.9750:Plead against the parricide!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_5:1.0000:Let us throng to pledge and pray
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_6:0.9750:O'er the patriot martyr's clay;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_7:0.9750:Then, with solemn faith in right,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_8:0.9750:That made him victor in the fight,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_9:1.0000:Cling to the path he fearless trod,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_10:1.0000:Still radiant with the smile of God.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_11:0.9750:Shroud the banner! rear the cross!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_12:1.0000:Consecrate a nation's loss;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_13:1.0000:Gaze on that majestic sleep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_14:1.0000:Stand beside the bier to weep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_15:1.0000:Lay the gentle son of toil
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_16:1.0000:Proudly in his native soil;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0198_17:1.0000:Crowned with honor, to his rest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_4:0.9500:Lo, the patriot martyr
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_5:1.0000:Taketh his journey grand!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_6:0.9750:Travels into the ages,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_7:1.0000:Bearing a hope how dear!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_8:1.0000:Into life's unknown vistas,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_11:1.0000:See, they come as a cloud,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_12:1.0000:Hearts of a mighty people,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_13:1.0000:Bearing his pall and shroud;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_14:1.0000:Lifting up, like a banner,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_15:1.0000:Signals of loss and woe;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_16:0.9500:Wonder of breathless nations,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_19:1.0000:Was it, O man beloved,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0199_20:1.0000:Was it thy funeral only
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_9:0.9500:NOW wake the requiem's solemn moan,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_11:0.9750:A nation's heart stands still today
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_12:1.0000:With horror, o'er his martyred clay!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_14:1.0000:Which fills our souls with vengeful fire!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_16:1.0000:Alone, can such a crime requite!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_17:1.0000:Farewell, thou good and guileless heart!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_18:1.0000:The manliest tears for thee must start!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_19:1.0000:E'en those at times who blamed thee here,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_20:1.0000:Now deeply sorrow o'er thy bier.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_21:0.9500:O, Jesus, grant him sweet repose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_22:1.0000:Who, like Thee, seemed to love his foes!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_23:1.0000:Those foes, like Thine, their wrath to spend,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0201_24:0.9750:Have slain their best, their firmest friend.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_13:1.0000:Not beneath some Eastern dome,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_14:1.0000:But where Freedom's airs may come,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_15:1.0000:Where the prairie grasses grow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_16:1.0000:To the friends who loved him so,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_17:1.0000:Take him to his quiet rest;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_18:1.0000:Toll the bell and fire the gun;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_19:1.0000:He who served his Country best,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_20:0.9500:He whom millions loved and bless'd,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_21:1.0000:Now has fame immortal won;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_22:1.0000:Rack of brain and heart is done.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_24:1.0000:O'er the tomb wherein he sleeps!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_25:0.9750:Wash away the bloody stain!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_26:0.9500:Drape the skies in grief, O rain!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_27:1.0000:Lo! a nation with thee weeps,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_28:1.0000:Grieving o'er her martyred slain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_29:1.0000:To the people whence he came,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_30:0.9750:Bear him gently back again,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_31:1.0000:Greater his than victor's fame;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_32:1.0000:His is now a sainted name;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_33:1.0000:Never ruler had such gain —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0203_34:0.9750:Never people had such pain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_4:0.9500:OTHOU of soul and sense and breath,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_8:1.0000:What most we cherish, we resign,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_9:1.0000:For life and death alike are Thine,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_10:1.0000:Who reignest Lord forever!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_11:1.0000:Our hearts lie buried in the dust
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_12:1.0000:With him, so true and tender,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_13:1.0000:The patriot's stay, the people's trust,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_14:0.9500:The shield of the offender;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_15:1.0000:Yet every murmuring voice is still,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_16:1.0000:As, bowing to Thy sovereign will,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_17:1.0000:Our best loved we surrender.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_19:0.9750:This martyr generation,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_20:0.9750:Which Thou, through trials manifold,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_21:0.9750:Art showing Thy salvation!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_22:1.0000:O let the blood by murder spilt
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_24:0.9500:And sanctify our Nation!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_28:1.0000:That none again may sever!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0205_30:1.0000:With trembling lips our song of praise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_11:0.9500:LINCOLN! thy country's father, hail!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_13:1.0000:Welcome unto thy chosen home —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_14:1.0000:Triumphant, glorious, dost thou come.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_15:1.0000:Before the enemy struck the blow
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_16:1.0000:That laid thee in a moment low,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_17:1.0000:God gave thy wish: It was to see
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_18:1.0000:Our Union safe, our country free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_19:0.9750:A country where the gospel truth
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_20:1.0000:Shall reach the hearts of age and youth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_21:1.0000:And move unchained, in majesty,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_22:0.9750:A model land of liberty!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_24:1.0000:Regained their home, the people mourn;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_27:0.9750:Far greater is the mourning now;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_28:1.0000:For our land one emblem wide of woe;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_29:1.0000:And where thy coffin car appears
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0207_30:0.9500:Do not the people throng in tears?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_1:0.9500:Thy triumph of a thousand miles,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_2:1.0000:Like eastern conqueror with his spoils —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_3:0.9750:A million hearts thy captives led,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_4:1.0000:All weeping for their chieftain dead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_5:1.0000:Thy chariot, moved with eagle speed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_6:1.0000:Without the aid of prancing steed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_7:1.0000:Has brought thee to that destined tomb;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_8:1.0000:Springfield, thy home, will give thee room.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_9:1.0000:Lincoln, the martyr, welcome home!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_10:1.0000:What lessons blossom on thy tomb!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_11:1.0000:In God's pure truth and law delight;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_12:1.0000:With firm, unwavering soul do right.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_13:1.0000:Be condescending, kind and just;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_14:1.0000:In God's wise counsels put thy trust;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_15:1.0000:Let no proud soul e'er dare rebel,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_16:1.0000:Moved by vile passions sprung from hell.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_17:1.0000:Come, sleep with us in sweet repose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_18:1.0000:Till we, as Christ from death arose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_19:1.0000:Still in His glorious image rise
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0208_20:0.9500:To dwell with him beyond the skies.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_2:1.0000:HERE is a shadow on the sunny air,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_3:1.0000:There is a darkness o'er the April day,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_4:1.0000:We bow our heads beneath this awful cloud
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_5:0.9500:So sudden come, and not to pass away.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_7:1.0000:O the wild grief that sweeps across our land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_9:1.0000:A people's tears, an orphaned nation's wail,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_10:1.0000:For him the good, the great, who is no more.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_11:1.0000:The noblest brain that ever toiled for man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_12:1.0000:The kindest heart that ever thrilled a breast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_13:1.0000:The lofty soul unstained by soil of earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_14:1.0000:Sent by a traitor to a martyr's rest.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_15:1.0000:And his last act (O gentle, kindly heart!)
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_16:1.0000:The noble prompting of unselfish grace.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_17:1.0000:He would not disappoint the waiting crowd
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_18:1.0000:Who came to gaze upon his honored face.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_19:1.0000:O God, thy ways are just, and yet we find
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_20:0.9750:This dispensation hard to understand.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_21:1.0000:Why must our Prophet's weary feet be stay'd
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_22:1.0000:Upon the borders of the Promised Land?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_23:1.0000:He bore the heat, the burden of the day,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_24:1.0000:The golden eventide he shall not see;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_25:1.0000:He shall not see the old flag wave again
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_26:1.0000:Over a land united, saved, and free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_27:1.0000:He loved his people, and he ever lent
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_28:0.9750:To all our griefs a sympathizing ear;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_29:1.0000:Now for the first time in these four sad years
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0210_30:0.9750:The stricken nation wails— he does not hear.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_1:0.9750:O never wept a land a nobler Chief!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_2:0.9750:Kind heart, strong hand, true soul— yet, while we
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_3:0.9500:weep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_4:1.0000:Let us remember, e'eu amid our tears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_6:1.0000:So sleeps he now, the chosen man of God,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_7:1.0000:No more shall care or sorrow wring his breast;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_8:0.9750:The weary one and heavy laden, lies
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_9:1.0000:Hushed by the voice of God to endless rest.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_10:1.0000:We need no solemn knell, no tolling bells,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_11:1.0000:No chanted dirge, no vain words sadly said.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0211_12:1.0000:The saddest kuell that ever stirred the air
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_7:0.9750:Hush the roll of the drum, hush the cannon's loud
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_9:1.0000:He will guide us to peace through the battle no more;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_12:1.0000:Where the star has gone down in the beautiful West.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_13:0.9750:Tread lightly, breathe softly, and gratefully bring
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_14:0.9500:To the sod that enfolds him the first flowers of spring;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0213_26:0.9500:To the sod that enfolds him the first flowers of spring;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_8:1.0000:In any vault 'neath any coffin lid,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_9:0.9750:In all the years since that wild spring of pain?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_10:0.9750:'Tis false — he never in the grave hath lain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_11:0.9750:You could not bury him although you slid
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_15:0.9750:In all the earth his great heart beats as strong,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_16:0.9750:Shall beat while pulses throb to chivalry,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_17:0.9750:And burn with hate of tyranny and wrong.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0215_18:0.9750:Whoever will may find him, anywhere
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_25:0.9500:Nor to the clouds a superstructure rear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_26:1.0000:For man's ambition or for servile fear.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_28:1.0000:A grateful people raise th' historic stone;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_29:0.9750:For where a patriot lived, or hero fell,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_30:1.0000:The daisied turf would mark the spot as well.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_31:0.9750:What though the Pyramids, with apex high,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0217_33:0.9750:And cast grim shadows o'er a desert land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_1:0.9500:Forever blighted by oppression's hand?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_2:1.0000:No patriot zeal their deep foundations laid —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_3:1.0000:No freeman's hand their darken'd chambers made —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_4:0.9750:No public weal inspired the heart with love,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_5:1.0000:To see their summits towering high above.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_6:1.0000:The ruling Pharaoh, proud and gory-stained,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_7:1.0000:With vain ambitions never yet attained; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_8:1.0000:With brow enclouded as his marble throne,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_9:0.9750:And heart unyielding as the building stone; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_10:0.9750:Sought with the scourge to make mankind his slaves,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_11:1.0000:And heaven's free sunlight darker than their graves.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_12:0.9750:His but to will, and theirs to yield and feel,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_13:1.0000:Like vermin'd dust beneath his iron heel; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_14:1.0000:Denies all mercy, and all right offends,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_15:1.0000:Till on his head th' avenging Plague descends.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_16:0.9750:Historic justice bids the nations know
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_17:0.9750:That through each land of slaves a Nile of blood shall
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_20:1.0000:Are, by the people, level'd with the dust.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_21:1.0000:Nor stone, nor bronze, can fit memorials yield
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_22:1.0000:For deeds of valor on the bloody field,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_24:1.0000:By freedom taught his country to revere,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_25:0.9750:Bids home and friends a hasty, sad adieu,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_26:1.0000:And treads where dangers all his steps pursue;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_27:1.0000:Finds cold and famine on his dauntless way,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_28:1.0000:And with mute patience brooks the long delay,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_29:1.0000:Or hears the trumpet, or the thrilling drum
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_30:1.0000:Peal the long roll that calls: "They come! they come!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_31:0.9750:Then to the front with battling hosts he flies,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_32:1.0000:And lives to triumph, or for freedom dies.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0218_33:1.0000:Thund'ring amain along the rocky strand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_1:0.9500:Loud on the gale she chimes the wild refrain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_2:0.9750:Or with low murmur wails her heroes slain!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_3:0.9750:In gory hulks, with splinter'd mast and spar,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_4:0.9500:Rocks on her stormy breast the valiant Tar: —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_5:1.0000:Lash'd to the mast he gives the high command,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_6:0.9750:Or midst the fight, sinks with the Cumberland.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_7:1.0000:Beloved banner of the azure sky,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_8:0.9750:Thy rightful home where'er thy eagles fly;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_9:1.0000:On thy blue field the stars of heav'n descend,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_10:1.0000:And to our day a purer luster lend.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_12:0.9750:And bade Thy peace to come, "and come to stay"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_13:0.9750:And while war's deluge fill'd the land with blood,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_14:0.9500:With bow of promise arch'd the crimson flood, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_15:0.9750:From fratricidal strife our banner screen,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_16:0.9750:And let it float henceforth in skies serene.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_17:1.0000:Yet cunning art shall here her triumphs bring,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_18:0.9750:And laurel'd bards their choicest anthems sing.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_19:1.0000:Here, honor'd age shall bare its wintery brow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_20:1.0000:And youth to freedom make a Spartan vow.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_21:1.0000:Here, ripened manhood from its walks profound,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_22:1.0000:Shall come and halt, as if on hallow'd ground.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_23:1.0000:Here shall the urn with fragrant wreaths be drest,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_24:1.0000:By tender hands the flow'ry tributes prest;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_25:1.0000:And wending westward, from oppressions far,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_26:1.0000:Shall pilgrims come, led by our freedom-star;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_27:1.0000:While bending lowly, as o'er friendly pall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_28:0.9750:The silent tear from ebon cheeks shall fall.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_29:0.9500:Sterile and vain the tributes which we pay —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_30:1.0000:It is the Past that consecrates today
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_31:0.9750:The spot where rests one of the noble few
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0219_32:1.0000:Who saw the right, and dared the right to do.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_1:1.0000:True to himself and to his fellow men,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_2:1.0000:With patient hand he moved the potent pen,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_4:1.0000:Such bondage break and such a host o'erthrow!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_5:1.0000:The simple parchment on its fleeting page
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_6:1.0000:Bespeaks the import of the better age, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_7:0.9750:When man, for man, no more shall forge the chain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_10:1.0000:Be fitly deem'd a sacred gift of heaven; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_11:1.0000:Though of the earth, it is no less divine, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_12:0.9750:Founded on truth it will forever shine,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_13:0.9750:Reflecting rays from heaven's unchanging plan —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_14:0.9500:The law of right and brotherhood of man.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_26:0.9500:Give of its century's pride.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_27:0.9750:Sangamon, stream of the prairies,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_28:0.9750:Placidly westward that flows,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_29:0.9750:Far in whose city of silence
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_30:1.0000:Calm he has sought his repose.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_31:0.9500:Over our Washington's river
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0220_32:0.9750:Sunrise beams rosy and fair;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_2:1.0000:Father and martyr lies there.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_4:0.9500:Snowy and golden and red;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_5:1.0000:Peers of the Palestine lilies
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_6:0.9750:Heap for your Glorious Dead!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_7:0.9750:Roses as fair as of Sharon,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_8:1.0000:Branches as stately as palm,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_9:1.0000:Odors as rich as the spices — ■
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_10:1.0000:Cassia and aloes and balm —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_12:0.9750:All with a gracious accord,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_13:1.0000:Ere the first glow of the morning
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_15:1.0000:Not for thy sheaves nor savannas
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_16:1.0000:Crown we thee, proud Illinois!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_17:1.0000:Here in his grave is thy grandeur;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_18:1.0000:Born of his sorrow thy joy.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_21:1.0000:Dearer than his in thy prairies,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_22:1.0000:Girdled with harvests of gold!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_23:0.9750:Still for the world through the ages
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0221_24:1.0000:Wreathing with glory his brow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_14:0.9500:As bravely in the closet as the field,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_16:1.0000:But then to stand beside her,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_17:1.0000:When craven churls deride her,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_18:1.0000:To front a lie in arms and not to yield,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_19:1.0000:This shows, methinks, God's plan
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_20:0.9750:And measures of a stalwart man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_21:0.9500:Limbed like the old heroic breeds,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_22:1.0000:Who stand self -poised on manhood's solid earth;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_23:1.0000:Not forced to frame excuses for his birth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_24:1.0000:Fed from within with all the strength he needs.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_26:1.0000:Whom late the Nation he had led,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_27:0.9500:With ashes on her head,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_28:1.0000:Wept with the passion of an angry grief;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_29:1.0000:Forgive me, if from present things I turn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0223_30:0.9750:To speak what in my heart will beat and burn,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_1:0.9750:Nature, they say, doth dote,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_2:1.0000:And cannot make a man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_4:0.9750:Repeating us by rote:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_5:0.9750:For him her Old World molds aside she threw,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_6:1.0000:And, choosing sweet clay from the breast
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_7:0.9500:Of the unexhausted West,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_8:0.9750:With stuff untainted shaped a hero new,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_9:0.9750:Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_10:1.0000:How beautiful to see
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_11:1.0000:Once more a shepherd of mankind indeed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_12:1.0000:Who loved his charge, but never loved to lead;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_13:1.0000:One whose meek flock the people joyed to be,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_14:1.0000:Not lured by any cheat of birth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_15:1.0000:But by his clear-grained human worth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_16:1.0000:And brave old wisdom of sincerity!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_17:1.0000:They knew that outward grace is dust;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_18:1.0000:They could not choose but trust
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_19:0.9750:In that sure-footed mind's unfaltering skill,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_20:0.9500:And supple-tempered will
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_21:0.9750:That bent like perfect steel to spring again and thrust!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_22:1.0000:His was no lonely mountain-peak of mind,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_23:1.0000:Thrusting to thin air o'er our cloudy bars,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_24:1.0000:A sea-mark now, now lost in vapors blind;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_25:1.0000:Broad prairie rather, genial, level-lined,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_26:0.9750:Fruitful and friendly for all human kind,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_27:1.0000:Yet also nigh to heaven and loved of loftiest stars.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_29:1.0000:Or, then, of Europe fronting mornward still,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0224_32:1.0000:Here was a type of the true elder race,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_1:0.9750:I praise him not; it were too late;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_2:1.0000:And some innative weakness there must be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_3:1.0000:In him who condescends to victory
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_4:0.9750:Such as the present gives, and cannot wait,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_5:0.9750:Safe in himself as in a fate.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_6:0.9750:So always firmly he;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_7:0.9750:He knew to bide his time,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_8:1.0000:And can his fame abide,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_9:1.0000:Still patient in his simple faith sublime,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_10:1.0000:Till the wise years decide.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_11:1.0000:Great captains, with their guns and drums,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_12:0.9500:Disturb our judgment for the hour,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_13:0.9750:But at last silence comes;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_14:0.9750:These are all gone, and, standing like a tower,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_15:1.0000:Our children shall behold his fame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_16:1.0000:The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_17:1.0000:Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0225_18:0.9500:New birth of our new soil, the first American.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_12:1.0000:OT as when some great captain falls
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_13:0.9750:In battle, where his country calls,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_14:0.9500:Beyond the struggling lines
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_15:1.0000:That push his dread designs
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_16:1.0000:To doom, by some stray ball struck dead:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_17:1.0000:Or in the last charge, at the head
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_18:0.9500:Of his determined men,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_19:0.9750:Who must be victors then!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_20:1.0000:Nor as when sink the civic great,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_21:0.9500:The safer pillars of the State,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_22:1.0000:Whose calm, mature, wise words
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_23:1.0000:Suppress the need of swords!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_24:0.9750:With no such tears as e'er were shed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_25:1.0000:Above the noblest of our dead
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_26:0.9500:Do we today deplore
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_27:0.9500:The man that is no more.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_28:1.0000:Our sorrow hath a wider scope,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_29:1.0000:Too strange for fear, too vast for hope, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_30:1.0000:A wonder, blind and dumb,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0227_31:0.9750:That waits — what is to come!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_1:1.0000:Not more astonished had we been
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_2:1.0000:If madness, that dark night, unseen,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_3:0.9750:Had in our chambers crept,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_4:1.0000:And murdered while we slept!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_5:1.0000:We woke to find a mourning earth —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_6:1.0000:Our Lares shivered on the hearth, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_7:0.9500:To roof-tree fallen — all
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_8:1.0000:That could affright, appall!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_9:1.0000:Such thunderbolts, in other lands,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_10:1.0000:Have smitten the rod from royal hands,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_11:1.0000:But spared, with us, till now,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_12:1.0000:Each laureled Caesar's brow.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_13:1.0000:No Caesar he, whom we lament,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_14:1.0000:A man without a precedent,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_15:1.0000:Sent it would seem, to do
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_16:1.0000:His work — and perish too!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_17:1.0000:Not by the weary cares of state,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_18:1.0000:The endless tasks, which will not wait,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_19:0.9750:Which, often done in vain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_20:1.0000:Must yet be done again;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_21:1.0000:Not in the dark, wild tide of war,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_22:1.0000:Which rose so high, and rolled so far,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_23:1.0000:Sweeping from sea to sea
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_24:0.9500:In awful anarchy; —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_25:0.9750:Four fateful years of mortal strife,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_26:1.0000:Which slowly drained the Nation's life,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_27:1.0000:(Yet, for each drop that ran
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0228_28:1.0000:There sprang an armed man!)
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_1:1.0000:Not then; — but when by measures meet-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_2:0.9750:By victory, and by defeat,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_3:0.9750:By courage, patience, skill,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_4:1.0000:The people's fixed "We will!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_5:1.0000:Had pierced, had crushed rebellion dead-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_6:1.0000:Without a hand, without a head: —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_7:1.0000:At last, when all was well,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_8:1.0000:He fell— O, how he fell!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_9:1.0000:Tyrants have fallen by such as thou,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_10:1.0000:And good hath followed, — may it now!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_12:0.9750:Produce the best events.)
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_13:1.0000:But he, the man we mourn today,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0229_14:1.0000:No tyrant was; so mild a sway
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_16:0.9500:The ship has weather 'd every wrack, the prize
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_17:0.9500:we sought is won;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_18:0.9500:The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all ex-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_19:0.9500:ulting,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_23:1.0000:O the bleeding drops of red,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_24:0.9750:Where on the deck my Captain lies,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_25:1.0000:Fallen, cold and dead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0231_29:0.9750:For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths — for you the
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_2:1.0000:This arm beneath your head;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_3:0.9750:It is some dream that on the deck
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_4:0.9750:You've fallen cold and dead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_5:0.9750:My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_7:0.9500:My Father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_10:0.9500:and done;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_11:1.0000:From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_13:0.9750:Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_14:1.0000:But I, with mournful tread,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_15:1.0000:Walk the deck where my Captain lies,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0232_16:0.9750:Fallen, cold and dead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_10:0.9500:Till lingering doubt may cling to hope no more.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_12:0.9500:Nor since, in time, or circumstance, or place,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_16:0.9750:A king of men, inured to hardy toil,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_17:1.0000:Rose truly royal up the steeps of life,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_19:0.9750:Beneath his greatness — great when traitors rife
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_20:1.0000:Pierced deep his country's heart with treason-knife;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_21:0.9750:But greatest when victorious he stood,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_22:1.0000:Crowning with mercy freedom's greatest strife.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_23:0.9750:The world saw the new light of godlike good
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_24:1.0000:Ere the assassin's hand shed his most precious blood.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_25:0.9750:Lament thy loss, sad sister of the West:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_26:1.0000:Not one, but many nations with thee weep;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_27:0.9750:Cherish thy martyr on thy wounded breast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_28:0.9750:And lay him with thy Washington to sleep.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_29:1.0000:Earth holds no fitter sepulcher to keep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0234_30:0.9500:His royal heart — one of thy kings to be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_2:0.9750:Than all ambition's pride and power and majesty.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_3:0.9500:Yet, yet rejoice that thou hadst such a son;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_4:1.0000:The mother of such a man should never sigh;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_5:1.0000:Could longer life a nobler cause have won?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_6:1.0000:Could longest age more gloriously die?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_7:1.0000:Oh! lift thy heart, thy mind, thy soul on high
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_8:1.0000:With deep maternal pride, that from thy womb
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_9:1.0000:Came such a son to scourge hell's foulest lie
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_10:0.9500:Out of life's temple. Watchers by his tomb!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_11:0.9500:He is not there, but risen: that grave is slavery's
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_24:0.9750:So tranquil, and steady, and clear were its beams,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_26:0.9750:A heart that we knew had been true to our weal,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_27:1.0000:And a hand that was steadily guiding the wheel;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0235_28:0.9500:A name never tarnished by falsehood or wrong,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_2:0.9500:And the true hand lies nerveless and cold on his breast;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_3:0.9500:But the name and the memory — these never will die,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_5:0.9750:Yet the tears of a Nation fall over the dead,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_6:0.9750:Such tears as a Nation before never shed;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_7:0.9500:For our cherished one fell by a dastardly hand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0236_20:0.9750:And yield him their hearts in a grateful acclaim.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_18:1.0000:The graves of heroes who have won the fight,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_19:1.0000:Who in the storming of the stubborn town
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_20:0.9750:Have rung the marriage peal of might and right,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_21:1.0000:And scaled the cliffs and cast the dragon down.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_22:1.0000:Paeans of armies thrill across the sea,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_23:1.0000:Till Europe answers — "Let the struggle cease.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_24:1.0000:The bloody page is turned; the next may be
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_25:1.0000:For ways of pleasantness and paths of peace!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_26:1.0000:A golden morn — a dawn of better things —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_27:1.0000:The olive-branch — clasping of hands again —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_28:1.0000:A noble lesson read to conquered kings —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_29:1.0000:A sky that tempests had not scoured in vain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_30:1.0000:This from America we hoped and him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0238_31:0.9500:Who ruled her "in the spirit of his creed."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_1:0.9500:Does the hope last when all our eyes are dim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_2:1.0000:As history records her darkest deed?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_3:1.0000:The pilot of his people through the strife,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_4:1.0000:With his strong purpose turning scorn to praise,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_5:1.0000:E'en at the close of battle reft of life
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_6:1.0000:And fair inheritance of quiet days.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_7:1.0000:Defeat and triumph found him calm and just,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_8:1.0000:He showed how clemency should temper power,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_9:1.0000:And, dying, left to future times in trust
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_10:1.0000:The memory of his brief victorious hour.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_11:1.0000:O'ermastered by the irony of fate,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_12:1.0000:The last and greatest martyr of his cause;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_14:1.0000:He saw the end, and fixed "the purer laws."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_15:1.0000:May these endure and, as his work, attest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_16:1.0000:The glory of his honest heart and hand —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_17:1.0000:The simplest, and the bravest, and the best —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_19:1.0000:Too late the pioneers of modern spite,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_20:1.0000:Awe-stricken by the universal gloom,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_21:1.0000:See his name lustrous in Death's sable night,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_22:1.0000:And offer tardy tribute at his tomb.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_23:1.0000:But we who have been with him all the while,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_24:0.9750:Who knew his worth, and loved him long ago,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_25:0.9750:Rejoice that in the circuit of our isle
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0239_26:0.9750:There is at last no room for Lincoln's foe.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_4:0.9500:streets,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_5:1.0000:But yesterday — our banners flaunted out
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_6:1.0000:Like flowers the south wind woos from their retreats;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_7:1.0000:Flowers of the nation, blue, and white, and red,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_8:0.9750:Waving from balcony, and spire, and mast;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_9:1.0000:Which told us that war's wintry storm had fled,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_10:1.0000:And spring was more than spring to us at last.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_11:0.9750:Today the nation's heart lies crushed and weak;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_12:1.0000:Drooping and draped in black our banners stand.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_14:0.9500:The grief that chokes all utterance through the land.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_15:0.9500:God is in all. With tears our eyes are dim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_16:1.0000:Yet strive through darkness to look to Him!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_17:0.9750:No, not in vain he died — not all in vain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_18:1.0000:Our good, great President! This people's hands
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_20:1.0000:Drawn tighter still in triple-woven bands
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_21:1.0000:To crush the fiends in human masks, whose might
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_22:1.0000:We suffer, oh, too long! No league, nor truce
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_23:1.0000:Save men with men! The devils we must fight
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_24:0.9750:With fire! God wills it in this deed. This use
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_25:0.9500:We draw from the most impious murder done
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_28:0.9500:Through pardoning clemency. Strike, strike again!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_29:0.9750:Draw closer round the foe a girdling flame.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0241_30:0.9500:We are stabbed whene'er we spare — strike in God's
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_3:0.9500:Than man e'er wore upon this side of death;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_4:0.9750:Mix with their laurels deathless asphodels,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_5:1.0000:And chime their pseans from the sacred bells!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_6:1.0000:Nor in your praises forget the martyred Chief,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_7:1.0000:Fallen for the gospel of your own belief,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_8:1.0000:Who, ere he mounted to the people's throne,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_9:0.9500:Asked for your prayers, and joined in them his own.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_10:0.9750:I knew the man. I see -him, as he stands
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_11:1.0000:With gifts of mercy in his outstretched hands;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_12:1.0000:A kindly light within his gentle eyes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_13:1.0000:Sad as the toil in which his heart grew wise;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_14:1.0000:His lips half parted with the constant smile
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_15:1.0000:That kindled truth, but foiled the deepest guile;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_16:1.0000:His head bent forward, and his willing ear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_17:1.0000:Divinely patient right and wrong to hear:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_18:1.0000:Great in his goodness, humble in his state,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_19:1.0000:Firm in his purpose, yet not passionate,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_20:1.0000:He led his people with a tender hand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_21:1.0000:And won by love a sway beyond command.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_22:1.0000:Summoned by lot to mitigate a time
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_23:1.0000:Frenzied with rage, unscrupulous with crime,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_24:1.0000:He bore his mission with so meek a heart
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_25:1.0000:That Heaven itself took up his people's part;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_26:1.0000:And when he faltered, helped him ere he fell,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_27:0.9750:Eking his efforts out by miracle.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_28:0.9750:No king this man, by grace of God's intent;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_29:1.0000:No, something better, freeman,— President!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0243_30:1.0000:A nature modeled on a higher plan,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_11:1.0000:OUR sun hath gone down at the noonday,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_13:1.0000:And over the morning the shadows
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_14:0.9500:Of night-time are back.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_19:0.9750:Lo! the beautiful feet on the mountains,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_20:0.9750:That yesterday stood;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_21:1.0000:The white feet that came with glad tidings
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_23:1.0000:The Nation that firmly was settling
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_24:0.9750:The crown on her head,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_25:1.0000:Sits, like Rizpah, in sackcloth and ashes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_26:0.9500:And watches her dead.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_27:1.0000:Who is dead? who, unmoved by our wailing
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_28:0.9500:Is lying so low?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_29:0.9750:O, my Land, stricken dumb in your anguish,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0245_30:0.9750:Do you feel, do you know?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_1:0.9750:Once this good man we mourn, overwearied,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_3:1.0000:Was going out from his audience chamber
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_4:0.9750:For a season to rest;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_6:1.0000:To honor and greet,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_7:0.9500:When the cry of a child smote upon him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_8:0.9500:And turned back his feet.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_9:0.9500:"Three days hath a woman been waiting,"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_10:1.0000:Said they, "patient and meek."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_11:1.0000:And he answered, "Whatever her errand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_12:0.9750:Let me hear; let her speak!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_13:1.0000:So she came, and stood trembling before him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_14:1.0000:And pleaded her cause;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_15:1.0000:Told him all; how her child's erring father
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_16:0.9500:Had broken the laws.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_17:1.0000:Humbly spake she: "I mourn for his folly,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_18:0.9500:His weakness, his fall";
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_19:0.9500:Proudly spake she: "he is not a TRAITOR,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_20:1.0000:And I love him through all!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_21:1.0000:Then the great man, whose heart had been shaken
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_22:1.0000:By a little babe's cry;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_23:1.0000:Answered soft, taking counsel of mercy,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_25:1.0000:Why, he heard from the dungeons, the rice-fields,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0246_28:0.9500:Smothered down on men's lips.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_1:0.9750:In her furnace, the centuries had welded
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_2:1.0000:Their fetter and chain;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_3:1.0000:And like withes, in the hands of his purpose,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_4:0.9500:He snapped them in twain.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_5:0.9750:Who can be what he was to the people;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_6:1.0000:What he was to the State?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_7:0.9750:Shall the ages bring to us another
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_9:1.0000:Our hearts with their anguish are broken,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_10:1.0000:Our wet eyes are dim;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_11:0.9750:For us is the loss and the sorrow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_13:1.0000:For, ere this, face to face with his Father
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_15:1.0000:Giving into his hand the white record
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_16:0.9750:With its great seal of blood!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_17:1.0000:That the hand which reached out of the darkness
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_18:0.9750:Hath taken the whole?
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_19:1.0000:Yea, the arm and the head of the people —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_20:0.9500:The heart and the soul!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_21:1.0000:And that heart, o'er whose dread awful silence
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_22:0.9750:A nation has wept;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0247_23:1.0000:Was the truest, and gentlest, and sweetest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_4:1.0000:So much a brother that his fame
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_5:0.9750:Seemed of our lives a common part.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_6:1.0000:His towering figure, sharp and spare,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_7:1.0000:Was with such nervous tension strung,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_8:1.0000:As if on each strained sinew swung
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_9:1.0000:The burden of a people's care.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_10:1.0000:His changing face, what pen can draw —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_11:1.0000:Pathetic kindly, droll or stern;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_12:1.0000:And with a glance so quick to learn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_13:1.0000:The inmost truth of all he saw.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_14:1.0000:Pride found no place to spawn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_15:1.0000:Her fancies in his busy mind.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_16:1.0000:His worth, like health or air, could find
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_17:1.0000:No just appraisal till withdrawn.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_18:1.0000:He was his country's — not his own;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_19:1.0000:He had no wish but for the weak,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_20:1.0000:Nor for himself could think or feel,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_21:1.0000:But as a laborer for her throne.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_22:1.0000:Her flag upon the heights of power —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_23:1.0000:Stainless and unassayed to place,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_24:0.9500:To this one end his earnest face
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_25:1.0000:Was bent through every burdened hour.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_26:1.0000:But done the battle — won the strife;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_27:1.0000:When torches light his vaulted tomb,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_28:1.0000:Broad gems flash out and crowns illume
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0250_29:0.9750:The clay-cold brow undecked in life.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_2:1.0000:Had robed our cause in victory's light;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_3:1.0000:Our country stood redeemed and bright,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_4:1.0000:With not a slave on all her soil.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_5:1.0000:'Mid peals of bells and cannon's bark,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_6:1.0000:And shouting streets with flags abloom,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_7:1.0000:Sped the shrill arrow of thy doom,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_8:1.0000:And, in an instant, all was dark!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_9:1.0000:A martyr to the cause of man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_11:1.0000:And in the world's great hero list
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_12:1.0000:His name shall lead the van.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_13:1.0000:Yes! ranked on Faith's white wings unfurled
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_14:1.0000:In Heaven's pure light, of him we say,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_15:0.9750:"He fell on the self -same day
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0251_16:0.9500:A Greater died to save the world."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_20:0.9750:The long lines break and wheel,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_21:0.9750:And the order is "Forward, March!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_22:1.0000:The colors ripple o'erhead,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_23:1.0000:The drums roll up to the sky,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_24:1.0000:And with martial time and tread
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_25:1.0000:The regiments all pass by —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_26:0.9500:The ranks of the faithful dead
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_27:0.9750:Meeting their president's eye.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_28:1.0000:March on, your last brave mile!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_29:1.0000:Salute him, star and lace!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_30:1.0000:Form 'round him, rank and file,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_31:1.0000:And look on the kind, rough face.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_32:1.0000:But the quaint and homely smile
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_33:1.0000:Has a glory and a grace
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_34:1.0000:It has never known erstwhile,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_35:1.0000:Never in time or space.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0253_36:1.0000:Close 'round him, hearts of pride!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_1:1.0000:Press near him, side by side!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_2:1.0000:For he stands there not alone.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_3:1.0000:For the holy right he died,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_4:0.9750:And Christ, the crucified,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_5:0.9500:Waits to welcome his own.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_11:0.9500:Engraven on each heart, O soul sublime!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_12:0.9750:That, like a planet through the heavens stray
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_13:0.9750:ing,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_14:0.9750:Outlives the wreck of time!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_15:1.0000:O rough, strong soul, your noble self-possession
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_16:1.0000:Is unforgotten. Still your work remains.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_17:1.0000:You freed from bondage and from vile oppression
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_18:0.9750:A race in clanking chains.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_19:1.0000:O furrowed face, beloved by all the nation!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_20:0.9750:tall gaunt form, to memory fondly dear!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_21:0.9750:O firm, bold hand, our strength and our salvation!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_22:1.0000:O heart that knew no fear!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_23:1.0000:Lincoln, your manhood shall survive forever,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_24:1.0000:Shedding a fadeless halo round your name;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_25:0.9750:Urging men on, with wise and strong endeavor,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_27:0.9500:Through years of care, to rest and joy a stranger,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_28:0.9750:You saw complete the work you had begun,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_29:1.0000:Thoughtless of threats, nor heeding death or danger,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0254_30:0.9500:You toiled till all was done.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_1:1.0000:You freed the bondman from his iron master,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_2:1.0000:You broke the strong and cruel chains he wore,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_4:1.0000:And brought her safe to shore.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_5:1.0000:You fell! An anxious nation's hopes seemed blighted,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_6:1.0000:While millions shuddered at your dreadful fall;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_7:0.9750:But God is good! His wondrous hand has righted
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_8:0.9500:And reunited all.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_9:1.0000:You fell, but in your death you were victorious;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_10:1.0000:To moulder in the tomb your form has gone,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_11:1.0000:While through the world your great soul grows more
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_13:0.9750:As years go gliding on!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_14:1.0000:All hail, great Chieftain! Long will sweetly cluster
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_15:1.0000:A thousand memories round your sacred name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0255_16:1.0000:Nor time, nor death shall dim the spotless luster
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_12:0.9500:But he chanted a song for the brave and the free —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_21:0.9750:He rose a meteor, upon wondering men,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_22:1.0000:But rose in strength, never to set again.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_23:1.0000:A king of men, though born in lowly state,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_24:1.0000:A man sincerely good and nobly great;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_25:1.0000:Tender, but firm; faithful and kind, and true,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_31:0.9500:In the schoolroom, from the pulpit, at the bar,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_32:1.0000:Shall look up to thee as to a beacon star,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0257_33:0.9750:And deduce the lesson from thy life and death,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_5:0.9750:Schooled through life's early hardships to endure,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_6:1.0000:To raise the oppressed, to save and shield the poor;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_7:0.9500:Prudent in counsel, honest in debate,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_8:1.0000:Patient to hear and judge, patient to wait;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_9:1.0000:The calm, the wise, the witty and the proved,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_10:0.9750:Whom millions honored, and whom millions loved;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_11:1.0000:Swayed by no baleful lust of pride or power,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_12:1.0000:The shining pageants of the passing hour,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_13:1.0000:Led by no scheming arts, no selfish aim,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_14:1.0000:Ambitious for no pomp, nor wealth, nor fame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_15:1.0000:No planning hypocrite, no pliant tool,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_16:1.0000:A high-born patriot, of Heaven's noblest school;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_17:1.0000:Cool and unshaken in the maddest storm,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_18:1.0000:For in the clouds he traced the Almighty's form;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_19:1.0000:Worn with the weary heart and aching head,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_20:1.0000:Worse than the picket, with his ceaseless tread,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_21:1.0000:He kept — as bound by some resistless fate —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_22:1.0000:His broad, strong hand upon the helm of State;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_23:1.0000:Nor turned, in fear, his heart or hope away,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_24:1.0000:Till on the field his tent a ruin lay.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_25:1.0000:His tent, a ruin; but the owner's name
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_26:1.0000:Stands on the pinnacle of human fame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_27:1.0000:Inscribed in lines of light, and nations see,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_28:1.0000:Through him, the people's life and liberty.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_29:0.9750:What high ideas, what noble acts he taught!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_30:1.0000:To make men free in life, and limb, and thought,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_31:1.0000:To rise, to soar, to scorn the oppressor's rod,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0258_32:0.9750:To live in grander life, to live for God;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_1:0.9750:To stand for justice, freedom and the right,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_2:1.0000:To dare the conflict, strong in God's own might;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_3:1.0000:The methods taught by Him, by him were tried,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_4:1.0000:And he, to conscience true, a martyr died.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_5:1.0000:As the great sun pursues his heavenly way
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_6:1.0000:And fills with life and joy the livelong day,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_7:1.0000:Till, the full journey, in glory dressed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_8:1.0000:He seeks his crimson couch beneath the west;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_9:1.0000:So, with his labor done, our hero sleeps;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_10:1.0000:Above his tomb a ransomed Nation weeps;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_11:1.0000:And grateful pseans o'er his ashes rise —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_12:1.0000:Dear is his fame— his glory never dies.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_13:0.9500:Bring flowers, fresh flowers, bring plumes with nod-
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_15:1.0000:To wreath the tomb where our great hero rests;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_16:1.0000:Bring pipe and tabret, eloquence and song,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_17:1.0000:And sound the loving tribute, loud and long;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_18:1.0000:A Nation bows, and mourns his honored name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_19:1.0000:A Nation proudly keeps his deathless fame;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_20:1.0000:Let vale and rock, and hill, and land, and sea
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0259_21:1.0000:His memory swell — the anthem of the free.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_23:1.0000:WELL may we all to Lincoln homage pay,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_26:0.9750:A debt of gratitude that all should know;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_27:1.0000:And ne'er will perish that historic tale.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_28:0.9750:To him, the Union's great defender, hail!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_30:0.9750:And ever proved a captain just and great.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_31:0.9500:Through storm and tempest, and unnumbered woes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_32:0.9750:While oft assailed in fury by his foes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_33:1.0000:He held his course, and triumphed over all,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_34:0.9500:Responding ever to his country's call;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_35:1.0000:And more divine than human seemed the deed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0263_36:0.9750:When he the slave from hellish bondage freed,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_1:1.0000:And from the South its human chattels tore.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_2:1.0000:'Twas his to Man his manhood to restore.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_3:1.0000:That righteous action sealed rebellion's doom,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_4:1.0000:And paved secession's pathway to the tomb.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_5:1.0000:But, lo! when Peace with Union glory, came,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_6:1.0000:And all the country rang with his acclaim —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_7:1.0000:A reunited country, great and strong —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_8:1.0000:A foul assassin marked him for his prey;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_9:1.0000:A bullet sped, and Lincoln dying lay.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_10:1.0000:Alas! Alas! that he should thus have died — ■
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_11:1.0000:His country's leader, and his country's pride!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_12:1.0000:No deed more infamous than this —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_13:1.0000:No fate more cruel and unjust than his —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_14:1.0000:Can in the annals of the world be found.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_15:1.0000:The Nation shuddered in its grief profound,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_16:1.0000:And mourning emblems draped the country o
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_17:1.0000:Alas! Alas! its leader was no more!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_18:1.0000:But still he lives in his immortal fame,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_19:1.0000:And evermore will Glory gild his name,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_20:1.0000:And keep his memory in eternal view,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0264_21:0.9750:And o'er his grave unfading garlands strew.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_21:0.9750:To Lincoln, who wrote the word,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_22:0.9750:And slavery's shackles fell
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_23:0.9500:From off a race
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_26:0.9750:To Lincoln, whose soul was great enough to know
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_27:1.0000:That beings born in likeness of their God
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_28:0.9750:Were meant to live as freemen,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_29:1.0000:Not as slaves, and ruled by slavery's rod.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_30:1.0000:To Lincoln, who more than any of his race
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_31:1.0000:Uplifted men and women to the place
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_32:0.9750:God made for them.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_33:0.9750:To Lincoln, who never saw your land,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0266_34:1.0000:And in whose veins no Scottish blood had run;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_2:1.0000:His mighty name
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_4:0.9750:And taught the people of each land
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_5:0.9750:That in God's hand
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_6:1.0000:Is held the destiny of races and of man.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_7:1.0000:Immortal patriot! through the mist of years
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_8:1.0000:That in the future are to come, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_9:1.0000:When we who saw thee here are gone, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_10:1.0000:We view thy heaven-aspiring tomb
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_11:0.9750:Illumined by the roseate dawn
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_12:0.9500:Of the millennial day,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_13:1.0000:When Peace shall hold her sway,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0267_14:1.0000:And bring Saturnian eras; when the roar
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_11:0.9750:HE crowd was gone, and to the side
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_12:1.0000:Of Borglum's Lincoln, deep in awe,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_13:1.0000:I crept. It seem'd a mighty tide
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_14:0.9750:Within those aching eyes I saw.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_17:1.0000:The battle's ended and the shout
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_18:1.0000:Shall ring forever and a day, —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_19:1.0000:Why sorrow yet, or darkly doubt?"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_20:0.9750:"Freedom," I plead, "so nobly won
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_21:1.0000:For all mankind, and equal right,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_22:1.0000:Shall with the ages travel on
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_23:1.0000:Till time shall cease, and day be night."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_24:1.0000:No answer — then; but up the slope,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_25:1.0000:With broken gait, and hands in clench,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_26:1.0000:A toiler came, bereft of hope,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0269_27:0.9750:And sank beside him on the bench.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_6:1.0000:Rests, flat, palm downward, by him on the seat.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_7:1.0000:So iEsop may have sat; so Lincoln did.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_8:1.0000:For all the sadness in the sunken eyes,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_9:0.9750:For all the kingship in the uncrowned brow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_10:1.0000:The great form leans so friendly, father-like,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_11:1.0000:It is a call to children. I have watched
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_12:1.0000:Eight at a time swarming upon him there,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_13:1.0000:All clinging to him — riding upon his knees,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_14:1.0000:Cuddling between his arms, clasping his neck,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_15:0.9500:Perched on his shoulders, even on his head;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_16:0.9500:And one small, play-stained hand I saw reached up
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_17:1.0000:And laid most softly on the kind bronze lips
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_18:1.0000:As if it claimed them. These were the children
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_19:1.0000:Of foreigners we call them, but not so
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_20:0.9500:They call themselves; for when we asked of one,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_21:1.0000:A restless dark-eyed girl, who this man was,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0271_22:1.0000:She answered straight, "One of our Presidents."
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_17:0.9500:So homely-beautiful, with just a trace
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_18:1.0000:Of humor lightening its look of care,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_19:1.0000:With bronze indeed his memory doth share,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_20:1.0000:This martyr who found freedom for a Race;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_21:1.0000:Both shall endure beyond the time and place
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_22:0.9750:That knew them first, and brighter grow with wear.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_23:0.9750:Happy must be the genius here that wrought
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_24:1.0000:These features of the great American
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_25:0.9750:Whose fame lends so much glory to our past —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_26:0.9500:Happy to know the inspiration caught
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_27:1.0000:From this most human and heroic man
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0273_28:0.9750:Lives here to honor him while Art shall last.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_11:0.9500:Gazed on the world and was satisfied;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_12:0.9750:It watched the centuries come and go —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_13:0.9750:It welcomed the sunlight, and loved the snow,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_14:1.0000:It grieved when the forest was forced to fall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_15:1.0000:But smiled when the steeples rose, white and tall,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_16:0.9500:In the valley below it, and thrilled to hear
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_17:1.0000:The voice of the great town roaring near.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_18:1.0000:When the mountain stream from its idle play
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_19:1.0000:Was caught by the mill-wheel, and borne away
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_20:1.0000:And trained to labor, the gray rock mused:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_21:1.0000:"Tree and verdure and stream are used
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_22:1.0000:By man, the master, but I remain
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_24:1.0000:Unchanged forever, by God's decree,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_25:1.0000:While passing centuries bow to me!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_26:1.0000:Then, all unwarned, with a heavy shock
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_27:0.9750:Down from the mountain was wrenched the rock.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_28:0.9750:Bruised and battered and broken in heart,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_29:1.0000:He was carried away to a common mart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_30:1.0000:Wrecked and ruined in peace and pride,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0275_31:0.9500:"Oh, God is cruel!" the granite cried;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_2:0.9750:By all deserted — how sad my end!"
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_3:1.0000:A dreaming sculptor, in passing by,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_4:0.9750:Gazed on the granite with thoughtful eye;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_5:1.0000:Then, stirred with a purpose supreme and grand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_6:1.0000:He bade his dream in the rock expand —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_7:1.0000:And lo! from the broken and shapeless mass,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_8:1.0000:That grieved and doubted, it came to pass
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0276_9:1.0000:That a glorious statue, of infinite worth —
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_18:1.0000:A monument of honor to the brave
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_19:1.0000:Who yielded up their lives, their all, to save
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_20:1.0000:Our glorious country, and to make it free
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_21:1.0000:From bondsmen's tears and lash of slavery.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_22:1.0000:Securely welded to thy rugged breast,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_23:1.0000:Through all the coming ages there shall rest
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_24:1.0000:Our Lincoln's tribute to a patriot band,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_25:1.0000:The noblest ever penned by human hand.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_26:0.9750:The storms of centuries may lash and beat
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_27:1.0000:The granite face and bronze with hail and sleet;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_28:1.0000:But futile all their fury. In a day
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_29:1.0000:The loyal sun will melt them all away.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0278_30:1.0000:Equal in death our gallant heroes sleep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0279_1:0.9750:Equal in glory, fadeless as the light
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0279_2:1.0000:The stars send down upon them through the night.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0279_3:0.9500:O priceless heritage for us to keep
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0279_4:1.0000:Our heroes' fame immortal while they sleep!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0279_5:0.9500:O God still guide us with thy loving hand,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_20:0.9500:The North her leader lost, the South her friend;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_21:0.9500:The nation lost its savior, and the slave
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_22:0.9750:Lost his deliverer, the most of all.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_23:0.9750:Oh, there was sorrow mid the humble poor
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_24:0.9750:When Lincoln died!
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_25:1.0000:When Lincoln died a great soul passed from earth,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_26:1.0000:A great white soul, as tender as a child
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_27:1.0000:And yet as iron willed as Hercules.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_28:1.0000:In him were strength and gentleness so mixed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_29:1.0000:That each upheld the other. He possessed
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_30:1.0000:The patient firmness of a loving heart.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_31:1.0000:In power he out-kinged emperors, and yet
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_32:1.0000:His mercy was as boundless as his power.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_33:1.0000:And he was jovial, laughter loving; still
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0281_34:1.0000:His heart was ever torn with suffering.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_1:1.0000:There was divine compassion in the man,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_2:1.0000:A godlike love and pity for his race.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_3:1.0000:The world saw the full measure of that love
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_5:1.0000:When Lincoln died a type was lost to men.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_6:1.0000:The earth has had her conquerors and kings
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_7:1.0000:And many of the common great. Through all
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_8:1.0000:She only had one Lincoln. There is none
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_9:1.0000:Like him in all the annals of the past.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_10:1.0000:He was a growth of our new soil, a child
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_11:1.0000:Of our new time, a symbol of the race
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_12:1.0000:That freedom breeds; was of the lowest rank,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_13:1.0000:And yet he scaled the highest height.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_16:1.0000:When Lincoln died it seemed a providence,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_17:1.0000:For he appeared as one sent for a work
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_18:0.9500:Whom, when that work was done, God summoned
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_20:1.0000:He led a splendid fight for liberty,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_21:1.0000:And when the shackles fell the land was saved;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_22:1.0000:He laid his armor by and sought his rest.
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0282_23:1.0000:A glory sent from heaven covered him
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_6:0.9750:How would his merry jests, the way he smiled,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_7:0.9750:Our sundered hearts to union have beguiled;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_8:0.9750:How would the South from his just rule have learned
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_9:0.9750:That enemies to neighbors may be turned,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_10:1.0000:And how the North, with his sagacious art,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_11:1.0000:Have learned the power of a trusting heart;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_12:1.0000:What follies had been spared us, and what stain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_13:0.9750:What seeds of bitterness that still remain,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_17:1.0000:Must do the noble deeds he would have done:
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_18:1.0000:Must lift the freedman with discerning care,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_19:1.0000:Nor house him in a castle of the air;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_21:0.9500:Fused in co-operating brotherhood;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_22:0.9750:Must banish enmity with his good cheer,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_23:1.0000:And slay with sunshine every rising fear;
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0285_24:1.0000:Like him to dare, and trust, and sacrifice,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0287_19:1.0000:By the master-minds of art,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0287_20:1.0000:And consecrated by a nation's tears,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0287_21:1.0000:To teach throughout the after-time,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0287_22:1.0000:To every tribe, in every clime,
poetslincolnt2603oldr_0287_23:0.9750:That toil for others is sublime.
