SONS FOR AND AGAINST SLAVERY. 93
from the dictation of these fugitive blacks of Canada, — a
few of which I transcribe.
" 29. William Johnson : —
" I look on slavery as a deadly poison. The slaves are
not satisfied with their lot. On the farm .where I worked,
in Virginia, and in all the neighborhood, no one was con-
tented. The man to whom I belonged did not give us
enough to eat. My feet were frozen in my flight, but I
would rather have died on the road than have turned back.
.... I have never seen a single fugitive that wished to
return ; I have never even heard of one.
" One of my companions was tied by a violent overseer,
and whipped unmercifully. He died shortly after, and
there was no doubt that his death was caused by the whip-
ping. His master was told of it, but he would not dis-
charge the overseer. This sin will find him out on the
judgment-day.
" The fear of being sold South urged me to escape more
than anything else. Our master was in the habit of telling
us that, if we did not suit him, he would soon put us in Ms
pocket, meaning that he would sell us and pocket the price.
" His son had a child by a negress, and the master
wished to sell this child, his own grandson, but was pre-
vented from doing it."
" 32. Rev. Alexander Helmslet : —
" My master was not in the habit of buying and selling,
but this was common in his neighborhood. The atrocity
of separating husbands and wives, parents and children,
seemed to me a crime that cried to heaven It was
pitiable to hear their shrieks, as they were huddled by force
into the carts The masters sometimes had regard
for certain slaves. But I have never seen any mercy
shown in the infliction of punishment ; this regard was due
in general to the most tyrannical feelings. I have seen a
pregnant woman tied up and whipped.
