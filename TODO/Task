My Goal:
Use machine learning to extract poems from text

Possible Ideas:
-- Mush all lines together into one long list of lines, perform analysis on all lines (fixes page break problem)
-- Run pre-analysis and get pages which look like they contain poetry, mush together prev page to next page and find poems (less computation, could miss small poems amidst lots of text)

-- Cluster analysis of lines with line number (from start of book) as a feature, so lines with similar features adjacent to each other get grouped together
	- Would then do text classification to classify cluster as poem or not (straightforward ML problem)
-- Train model to recognize start and end lines of poems, and to recognize outlier lines in the middle of poems. Then call a poem everything between a start line and the next end line, not including outlier lines
	- Possibly two models, one to recognize start and end lines, and one to recognize outlier lines
-- Conditional Random Field
-- Two layered classifier
	- Layer 1: Linewise classifier, looks at several lines before and after current line. Classify as Poetry or Other
	- Layer 2: Looks at probability output of Layer 1, identifies what it believes to be poems
