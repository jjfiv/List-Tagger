geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_1:0.6500:years of revelation, of repulsion mental and physical,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_2:0.5000:of misery not to be told. One by one her little illusions,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_6:0.5500:bruised soul, just one more desire, one final hope, of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_7:0.5000:which the very possibility was by this time all but ex
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_8:0.5000:tinguished.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_29:0.7000:"Mary-Mother protect me! I have waited very
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_35:0.6500:the isolation of his life, till my very family shuns me.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0018_36:0.5000:Oh, Thy hand has lain heavy upon me, but I have not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_15:0.6000:me the soul of your child."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_16:0.6500:The Princess bowed to the floor.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_17:0.6000:"Your eyes behold a little, lonely spirit, that is to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_18:0.5500:be given into your care. Guard it and guide it ; for the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_21:0.6000:self nearing the end of your unhappy journey ; and dur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_23:0.7000:then, upon the face of your son."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_24:0.7500:Swiftly the little spirit left the protecting shadow of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_25:0.6500:its holy guide, and paused beside Sophia. She would
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_26:0.6500:have clasped the shadowy body in her eager arms, but
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_27:0.8000:a sense outside herself forbade this, and she could only
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_28:0.7000:gaze searchingly into the gentle, childish face.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_29:0.7500:"Thou art mine? my son?" she whispered, softly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_30:0.8500:The little creature looked up at Mary-Mother and then,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_31:0.7500:at once, returned to the sad mortal at its side. The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_32:0.7500:little face brightened with a smile, and the lips formed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_33:0.8000:the dear word, "Mother!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_34:0.9000:Then, immediately, darkness had fallen. The visitors
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_35:0.9000:from afar were gone. Sophia lay upon the bare floor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0020_36:0.6500:beneath the ikon, fast asleep.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0021_3:0.7000:haste :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0021_4:0.5000:"My lady! Khazyaeeka! His Excellency Prince
geniuspotter00pottiala_0022_27:0.6000:gorievs was at some distance from its stately neighbor,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0022_28:0.5500:however; for it stood on the southeast corner of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_1:0.6000:Konnaia Square, approachable by carriage only through
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_2:0.5000:the Serpoukhovskaia. Its surroundings were of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_4:0.5000:chants' quarter, and so far from the sacred precincts of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_31:0.6500:their ranks, the ranks of the old nobility of the Empire.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_32:0.5500:By New Year's morning, however, the numbers were
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_33:0.5000:admitting, bitterly, their defeat. Once more Gregoriev
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_34:0.5500:was about to achieve the impossible. Eighteen years
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_35:0.7500:before, Moscow society had defeated him, superbly. At
geniuspotter00pottiala_0023_36:0.5500:the time of his marriage to a daughter of the Blashkovs,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_11:0.6000:For eighteen years, then, the Gregoriev palace had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_12:0.6500:stood in its isolation, echoing only to the revelry that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_15:0.6000:secretly planning to obtain what was not for sale: had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_16:0.6000:faced, unmoved, an isolation which, to a nature less
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_18:0.5000:Now, at last, he was about to win. His amazing in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_19:0.5500:trigue had succeeded. Its results were for the eyes of all
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_20:0.6500:men. For Moscow society had been suddenly command
geniuspotter00pottiala_0024_34:0.5500:the rigid etiquette of court - dress, were fully exposed,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_1:0.7500:stinctively backward. To one understanding it, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_2:0.5500:act was pathetically familiar. An instant later, how
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_3:0.7000:ever, the Princess cried out, "Caroline! It is you,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_4:0.7000:then?" and so turned deathly white and reeled a little
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_5:0.8000:till old Mdsha came to her support.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_6:0.9500:"Sophie! You are not ill to-night!" The new
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_7:0.8500:comer, who had spoken in French, halted near the door,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_8:0.8000:an expression of dismay on her face.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_9:0.8000:Madame Gregoriev, however, laughed faintly, and the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_10:0.7000:color began to creep back into her cheeks. As old
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_11:0.6000:Ma"sha left her to hobble briskly out of the room, she
geniuspotter00pottiala_0026_12:0.7000:continued, "No, no! I am perfectly well. It was only
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_28:0.6000:particulier."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_29:0.5500:Sophia complied with the request: the maids, with the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_31:0.5000:missal reluctantly. But Madame Dravikine held them
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_32:0.5500:all in awe, and before her they did not dare the protest
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_35:0.6000:seated themselves on a great sofa upholstered in a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0027_36:0.6000:beautifully faded old brocade, made before the birth of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_1:0.5500:the great Catharine. And while Caroline, mindful of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_2:0.6500:her fresh gauzes, sat upright, like a bird poised for flight,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_3:0.7000:her sister lay back, wearily, crushing the veil of her head
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_4:0.6500:dress against a heap of pillows.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_5:0.7500:There was a moment's pause; then the Countess be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_6:0.8000:gan, resolutely : " Has Michael Petrovitch seen you yet ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_7:0.6000:"Oh no! He has not come up-stairs. I hope that he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_8:0.7500:will not, Katrelka! He he would not be satisfied, you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_9:0.6500:know."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_10:0.6500:"Sophie! Sophie! sometimes I cannot wonder that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_11:0.5000:the man is a terror in your life! Satisfied with you!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_13:0.5500:with a toilet of mine, I should not speak to him for a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_15:0.5500:the ministry that he would come to me on his knees in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_16:0.5500:three days! I tell you again, Sophie, that you must
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_17:0.5500:assert yourself! Tell me "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_18:0.5500:"Stop, Kasha, stop! I am too tired for all this just
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_20:0.6000:thing is a great strain. Tell me only this: Are you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_35:0.5500:"Caroline, I wish " Madame Gregoriev's hesitating
geniuspotter00pottiala_0028_36:0.6000:voice trailed into silence. She knew that it was scarcely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_13:0.6000:am happy to-night! Think "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_15:0.7500:think you a parvenue, absolutely, to hear you!" broke in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_16:0.5000:Caroline, sharply, still smarting a little at her reading
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_17:0.7500:of that unfinished sentence.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_18:0.7500:Sophia colored at her sister's appellation, but had no
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_19:0.7500:time for rejoinder; for at this moment an inner door
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_20:0.8000:was pushed gently open and a boy entered.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_21:0.8000:Sophia rose, hastily. "Ivan! You were asleep two
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_22:0.6500:hours ago!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_23:0.5500:" But I woke up. And Ma"sha said you were so splen
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_33:0.5500:tournez imme'diatement au lit. Tu vas prendre un
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_35:0.7000:nor had far to stoop to reach his lips. Then, with a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0029_36:0.5500:gentle hand, she led him back to the door. The boy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_1:0.6000:moved reluctantly, and, ere he left the room, caught his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_2:0.7000:mother round the neck and whispered in her ear a ques
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_3:0.7000:tion which was answered by a determined shake of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_4:0.8000:head.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_5:0.8500:When he had gone, the Princess stood for an instant
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_6:0.8000:looking after him, all her heart in her unconscious eyes.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_7:0.7500:Then, her eyes shining with a softened light, she turned
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_8:0.8500:again to her sister, saying, with a smile:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_9:0.8000:"Come, Katrelka, let us go down. The opera must
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_10:0.7500:be over by this time; and I must see the rooms before
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_11:0.7000:the first arrival."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_12:0.7000:"Just one moment more, then, Moussia." Madame
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_13:0.6500:Dravikine rose, crossed the room, and laid her hand
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_14:0.5500:caressingly on the other's arm. "If Michael Petrovitch
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_15:0.5000:should be out of temper when we meet him, do not be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_16:0.5000:disturbed. Do not, for the sake of our family, Sophie,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_17:0.7000:betray yourself by by your face to-night. Remem
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_18:0.9000:ber, if the scene should grow unbearable I can always "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_19:0.6500:"Yes, yes, Kasha. Thank you. But let us not speak
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_20:0.8000:of it further just now."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_21:0.9000:A moment's silence. Then suddenly, by a common
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_23:0.6000:other's arms and kissed fervently. When they had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_24:0.8500:separated again, the eyes of the Countess were no less
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_25:0.5000:suspiciously wet than those of her sister, the wife of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_27:0.6000:It was a pity that functions of formal magnificence
geniuspotter00pottiala_0030_35:0.5000:floor. Upon this landing, facing the hall below, stood the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_1:0.6000:Greek curves wreathed to-night in smilax and white roses,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_2:0.6000:brought up from the southern estates of the Prince.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_3:0.7000:As the sisters descended the stairs together, each
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_4:0.7000:critically surveying the decorations of the rooms below,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_5:0.6000:Prince Michael himself appeared from the direction
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_6:0.5000:of the great dining-room, accompanied by his major-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_7:0.6000:domo, to whom he was giving some final orders con
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_13:0.6000:ernor-General ; and privately and intimately known to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_14:0.6000:the Czar, who had long been aware that he had at least
geniuspotter00pottiala_0031_15:0.5000:one man in his Empire who would balk at no order that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0032_1:0.5000:orders ; and, turning from the cringing serf, stood staring
geniuspotter00pottiala_0032_2:0.7500:at his wife and her sister. Madame Dravikine was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0032_3:0.7500:smiling brightly; but Sophia's face was set, her cheeks
geniuspotter00pottiala_0032_4:0.8000:flaming, her burning eyes unwontedly hard.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0032_36:0.6000:cealed, a figure unconsciously pathetic, his great, sad
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_18:0.6000:at a quarter before one, the sisters met in a corner of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_19:0.5500:dining-room, and there passed between them a white-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_20:0.5500:faced look. Then Madame Dravikine whispered:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_21:0.5500:" Sophie, what does it mean ? Did Nicholas promise ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_23:0.6500:lips went white, and she seemed to speak with difficulty.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_24:0.6500:"Caroline! Then you were not assured by him? You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_25:0.8000:as well as Michael have deceived me?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_26:0.9000:Madame Dravikine flushed scarlet. "I have never
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_27:0.7000:discussed your affairs with his Majesty," she returned,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_28:0.6000:haughtily.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_29:0.7000:Sophia made no reply. Her face, if possible, grew a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_30:0.5500:little more livid, her eyes a trifle more piteous.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_31:0.7000:Caroline, in spite of her resentment, was touched with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_32:0.8000:pity and with fear; so that, presently, she burst out, im
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_33:0.8000:pulsively: "Then you are ruined, Sophie! Absolutely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_34:0.7000:ruined!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_35:0.7000:Suddenly, Princess Sophia's lips curled into a bitter
geniuspotter00pottiala_0034_36:0.5500:smile. "I have been ruined, as you call it, for eighteen
geniuspotter00pottiala_0035_9:0.5000:"The Czar is here!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0035_10:0.9500:"After all, his Majesty has arrived."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0035_11:0.5500:"Where is he, then?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0035_12:0.6500:"In his dressing-room. The royal sleigh is at the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_1:0.5500:rection of the dining-room, and the poor lady turned to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_5:0.8000:centrated mixture of defeat, rage, and rebellion glared
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_7:0.6500:Now, indeed, she knew that they were undone.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_8:0.5500:" Alderberg! Alderberg! By God and the devil, had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_21:0.7500:clasp.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_22:0.7000:"Ah! You, too, Katrelka!" whispered Sophia. "You,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_23:0.5000:too, think it so bad?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_24:0.9500:Caroline shook her head sadly. "We are helpless,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_25:0.7500:Sophie. A fit of Nicholas' laziness has lost the world to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_26:0.5500:you. Look!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_28:0.5000:the Prince and Princess Mirski came up with chill good-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_31:0.5000:towards Michael, but had the grace to murmur some
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_35:0.5500:proached, having been in the rooms a bare five minutes.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0036_36:0.5000:And, as he disappeared into the royal alcove, the throng
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_1:0.5500:There was but one consolation for this misery it was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_7:0.5500:streaming, divined calamity, and, without so much as
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_23:0.7500:finally broke in desperation:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_24:0.6000:"Come, Sophie! Come to bed. You are too tired to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_25:0.5000:stay down here. You'll be ill."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_26:0.5000:But, at the moment, Sophia had, in her heart, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_27:0.6500:thought of another than herself. At sight of some un
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_28:0.6000:wonted suggestion in his face of a pain with which she
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_31:0.5500:a momentary courage, she advanced to her husband and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_32:0.5000:tookhishand. "Michael, "she murmured, "I am sorry."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_33:0.7000:The man started in amazement, and then drew away
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_34:0.6000:from her, at the same time turning upon her his burning
geniuspotter00pottiala_0038_35:0.7500:eyes. "Sorry! Good God! Then get to your ikons

geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_5:0.6000:written in what was evidently a cipher. The key to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_6:0.5500:this was hidden in the brain of the man who had com
geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_7:0.8000:posed it.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_8:0.7000:Michael himself had dubbed this square of parchment
geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_9:0.6500:a map: his map of men. And it contained mention of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0042_11:0.5000:pire. Nicholas himself was there, side by side with his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0046_2:0.6500:that name was knowable. And this fact, mirabile dictu,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0046_3:0.5000:had, after long cogitation, been at last borne in upon

geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_1:0.6500:some other appointment. I shall hardly start for the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_2:0.5000:Kremlin before one.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_3:0.6500:"But but my dear Gregoriev! The Czar! Your
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_4:0.8000:audience! You see you forget, my good fellow!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_5:0.8000:"I forget nothing whatever, General: not even prom
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_6:0.7500:ises that are not kept."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_7:0.8500:Ryumin stared, open-mouthed, as Gregoriev 's gloomy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0050_8:0.7000:eyes met his. Then, with a thrill of wonder, he under
geniuspotter00pottiala_0052_1:0.5000:played his difficult part with genius, had left his Majesty
geniuspotter00pottiala_0052_29:0.5000:Within the discreet recesses of this nameless organiza
geniuspotter00pottiala_0052_35:0.6500:names were as changeable as their complexions, set
geniuspotter00pottiala_0054_1:0.7500:drunk. But he was, nevertheless, the evil genius of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_1:0.8500:"Sophia, the thing is unbearable! How can you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_2:0.8500:possibly permit yourself to endure it? For God's sake,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_3:0.7500:pull yourself up, and leave this
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_4:0.9000:"Ivan! Alexei is waiting for you. Go at once!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_5:0.7000:broke in the Princess, sharply, her eyes fixed upon her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_6:0.6500:sister with a light of bitter reproof in their weary depths.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_7:0.7500:At the same time, she held out both hands to her son.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_8:0.6000:Without a word, the boy rose and went to his mother.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_9:0.6500:A kiss passed between them. Then he turned and walk
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_10:0.6500:ed straight to the door. He did not once look back.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_11:0.8000:But neither woman failed to perceive that his deli
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_12:0.8000:cate hands were clinched so tightly that the bloodless
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_13:0.9000:knuckles were tinged with blue.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_14:0.7500:When the door closed behind him, Sophia Ivanovna
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_15:0.6000:answered her sister's unfinished question: "You think
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_17:0.6000:imagine that he would permit his son to go with me?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_18:0.6500:Am I then to leave my child here to that ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_19:0.9000:With a low exclamation, Caroline went forward and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0055_20:0.8500:fell upon her knees beside her sister, asking for pardon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0056_2:0.5500:THE west wing of the palace in the Serpoukhovskaia
geniuspotter00pottiala_0056_3:0.5000:sheltered two beings whose outward and inner lives,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_1:0.6500:a silent, observant young creature, not morbid nor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_3:0.6000:bilities not to be found in the usual hobbledehoy of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_4:0.6000:his age. And though it is probable that, in after years,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_5:0.5500:he felt his aloofness far more keenly than at the present
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_34:0.5000:for his own.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0057_35:0.5000:From the time of his babyhood, Ivan had lived in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0060_35:0.7500:inner joy: the joy of eager motherhood. And in Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0060_36:0.6000:this joy found its repetition in a vein of practical gayety.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0064_34:0.5500:It happened in this wise.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0064_35:0.7000:Through the years of his son's infancy and boyhood
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_4:0.6000:misery to him than a delight that, within a few hours,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_7:0.5000:It was the end of September before the little party
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_17:0.6000:of his father.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_18:0.5500:Michael received his son in his public office: a room
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_20:0.7500:figure of the Prince, magnificent in gold -embroidered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_21:0.7500:uniform; booted, spurred, fiery-eyed and fierce-mus-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_22:0.7000:tached, but for all that showing a softened light in his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_23:0.8500:face as he perceived his son.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_24:0.8000:Piotr was promptly dismissed, and Ivan seated at the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_25:0.5000:huge table whence he could gaze at the burly figure
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_26:0.5500:opposite him as long as his eyes had courage to look up.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_27:0.7000:Nevertheless the pause was uncomfortable enough; and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_28:0.7000:the boy was glad when the silence ended.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_29:0.9000:"Ivan! you're now at the age at which I entered my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_30:0.8500:first battle as drummer-boy and had Hm! my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_31:0.5000:first love-affair. Are you in love?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_32:0.7000:Ivan's velvet eyes lifted themselves slowly to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_33:0.6000:glittering orbs set in the dark face. No word passed the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_34:0.7000:young lips, but Michael read, plainly enough, the won
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_35:0.8500:dering displeasure in the boyish face. Slightly amused,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0066_36:0.5000:he went on, relentlessly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_1:0.6000:his father's conduct and manner of speech. And him
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_2:0.5000:self! How preposterously he had behaved! Not a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_3:0.5500:word, not a single sign of response or comprehension
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_4:0.7000:could he remember having given. Certainly his father
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_28:0.6000:clasped tightly in two that were dry and burning. The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_29:0.7000:boy, relieved, gave a long, quiet sigh; but it was Sophia
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_30:0.7500:who began to speak.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_31:0.9000:"Ivan, yesterday you saw your father?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_32:0.9000:"Ah! You know, then, mother?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_33:0.7000:" Know what, my son ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_34:0.7500:"What what he said? About my saint's-day sup
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_35:0.6500:per? Mother, I was to tell you. He said, tell you that,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0068_36:0.6500:on the seventh that's the day your rule is over, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0069_14:0.5000:"Then, you do not want this supper?" her gaze at him
geniuspotter00pottiala_0069_16:0.6000:To her secret consternation, however, Ivan hesitated.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0070_27:0.5500:Wednesday and most of Thursday passed, for mother
geniuspotter00pottiala_0070_35:0.6000:him, and his promised suit, gorgeous even beyond ex
geniuspotter00pottiala_0074_27:0.5000:readjustment. But Michael Petrovitch Gregoriev, who,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0074_28:0.5000:it might have been thought, had good cause for appre-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_1:0.6000:commission in the Cadet Corps: something that none of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_2:0.6000:our race has ever had. I tried, of course, for the Pages,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_4:0.9000:out an ensign of the line, and I can buy your lieutenancy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_5:0.6500:in a guard regiment within the month. You under
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_6:0.8500:stand?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_7:0.7500:Michael paused, and fixed his keen eyes on the boy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_8:0.5000:who was now on his feet, motionless, his brows knitted.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_9:0.6500:He was a little bewildered by the unexpectedness of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_10:0.6000:thing. Yet he did understand tumultuously , what that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_11:0.8500:great news meant.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_12:0.8000:"When do I leave here?" he asked, presently, in a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_13:0.8000:voice that was strange to him.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_14:0.7500:" In one week to the day. There are preparations to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_15:0.9000:be made. You go like the Prince you are. Christ!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_16:0.7500:If 7 had had the chance!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_17:0.7000:This last, muttered exclamation, Ivan scarcely heard.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0076_20:0.5000:difficult regret. The silence seemed longer than it was.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0078_1:0.5500:soften. But Michael, imagining that rapt expression to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0078_4:0.6000:prehended gift, that the immediate prospect of the new
geniuspotter00pottiala_0078_7:0.5000:This brief ecstasy of unsought happiness could not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0080_32:0.5000:and last time in her life, laid bare her heart before her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0080_34:0.5500:from reverent interest to pity, from pity to horror, from
geniuspotter00pottiala_0080_35:0.7500:horror to absolute fury, till, thinking of the Gregoriev
geniuspotter00pottiala_0080_36:0.5500:blood that ran in his veins, he longed to tear from his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0084_2:0.5000:been a Pole.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0084_3:0.5500:In this gathering, where all were in some degree noble,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_17:0.5000:He had the day to ponder over this news: reserving
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_23:0.5500:Piotr, white-faced and red -eyed. At his appearance
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_24:0.5000:Ivan halted for one, heart-stilling instant. Then he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_25:0.7000:muttered, in a hoarse, dry voice:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_26:0.8000:"My mother! She is dead?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0088_27:0.8000:Piotr slowly shook his head, replying: "Not yet.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_1:0.5500:Moreover, as the weeks passed, the Sunday evenings
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_13:0.5000:significance filling his heart with a pain which the mor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_15:0.5500:Months slid by. The Russian New Year came and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_27:0.5500:weight now constantly dragging at his heart.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_28:0.5500:Had Ivan guessed half the truth, however: could he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_32:0.5500:parison to the helpless misery of watching and com
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_34:0.6000:pitiless, direfully cruel, of all diseases.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_35:0.7000:It had been in the very first v/eek of Ivan's life in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0090_36:0.5000:Corps that Sophia Ivanovna returned, in a kind of numb
geniuspotter00pottiala_0092_34:0.5500:of recovery.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0092_35:0.5000:After this explanation, made by the German doctor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0092_36:0.5000:and entirely corroborated by his Russian colleague,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0094_1:0.6500:Gregoriev sank into his place again with a groan of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0094_2:0.5000:relief. "Operate, then! Operate at once to-day, if
geniuspotter00pottiala_0094_34:0.7000:haggard lines about his mouth, and dulled the fires of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0094_35:0.5000:those terrible eyes ? Sophia herself asked that question
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_1:0.6500:kisses of husband and brother upon an unwrinkled brow ;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_2:0.6000:and, as she lifted her head towards the sweet-smelling
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_3:0.6000:sponge, there was a faint smile upon her lips, a gleam
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_4:0.6000:of relief in her tired eyes.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_5:0.5500:Vassily Blashkov and his black brother-in-law waited
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_13:0.5000:something in the pose of that helpless form which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_31:0.5000:"You haven't told him, I understand?" Blashkov
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_32:0.6500:began, in a low tone.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_33:0.8000:"Not yet. If if she comes out he may see her.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_34:0.9500:The anxiety will be less for him. She she's his whole
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_35:1.0000:life, here."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0096_36:0.6500:"And he hers, I imagine?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0097_32:0.7500:A woman's whisper broke the twilight: "Thank God!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0097_35:0.7000:The operation has been a terribly difficult one. Her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0097_36:0.5000:Ladyship's condition is critical."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_1:0.7500:Silence. Then a faint groan from Michael's chair.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_2:0.5000:There followed six hours of waiting, watching, hoping,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_3:0.5500:despairing. The deadened consciousness trembled on
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_8:0.6000:Caroline would whisper a question, hoping always for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_9:0.7000:an answer suggestive of hope. But the reply was always
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_10:0.7500:the same:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_11:0.7500:"We cannot tell. Wait."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_12:0.8500:It was nine o'clock at night before the body stirred
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_13:0.5500:naturally for the first time, and a long, fluttering sigh
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_14:0.5500:broke from the pallid lips. From Caroline came a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_15:1.0000:t faint cry of joy; and then Sophia's great eyes opened,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_16:0.9000:languidly, and her look was turned upon her sister.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_17:0.9000:"Mother!" she whispered, smiling.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_18:0.9000:"No, Sophie! No!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_19:0.9500:But Weimann was at her elbow. "Do not contra
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_20:1.0000:dict!" he murmured. Then he turned to Michael.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_21:0.9500:"You have a son?" he said, quietly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_22:0.9000:"Yes! You mean " Michael's face had not held
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_23:1.0000:this look before.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_24:0.7000:"He should be here," said the doctor, steadily. "I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_25:1.0000:think she will know you all yet."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_26:0.7500:Prince Gregoriev bowed his head upon his breast, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_27:0.6500:stole from the room. Ten minutes later Piotr was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_28:0.5500:speeding across Moscow in his master's brougham,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_29:0.5000:towards the Corps des Cadets.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_30:0.7000:Of that long drive homeward across the city, Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_31:0.5000:only memory was of a long blur of pain that culminated,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_34:0.7500:the well-known window on the second floor from which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0098_35:0.6000:his mother's face had so often greeted him or smiled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_1:0.6500:bed and stood gazing down upon the quivering face up
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_2:0.6500:turned to him. Then, after a moment of preparation,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_3:0.7500:the dreadful breathing ceased, and a faint, shaking voice
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_4:0.8000:replaced it:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_5:0.8500:"Ivan! Dearest! You have come!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_6:0.7500:Taking his mother's transparent hands with a move
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_11:0.6000:stealing away, and presently, save for one nurse, he was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_12:0.5000:alone with her who, sixteen years before, had brought
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_13:0.6500:him into the world.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_14:0.7000:In the silence that surrounded him Ivan felt his very
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_15:0.6000:'soul pierced by a medley of unknown emotions, chief of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_16:0.5000:which was the sense that he stood alone and helpless
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_17:0.8500:before a separation that he could not bear. And pres
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_18:0.8000:ently that dread was voiced for him, in the strange,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_19:0.9000:weak, tender tones of his mother's voice:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_20:0.8500:"I must leave you soon now, Ivan."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_21:0.9500:At last a sob tore its way through his rigid throat,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_22:0.8000:and his answer was given in a passionate whisper:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_23:0.7500:"No, mother! No!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_24:0.7000:"Dear, my body is going. You could not wish to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_25:0.6000:keep me always. And I am so glad, Ivan! So glad!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_26:0.7000:My own mother has been here, at my side, all day. So,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_27:0.7500:then, I shall come and comfort you at least at the first,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_28:0.7000:while it is most sad for you."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_29:0.7500:"'At first!' Do you think I can stop wanting you,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_30:0.7000:grieving for you ever?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_31:0.6000:She could smile, that dying one, in her great wisdom,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_32:0.5000:at this passionate repudiation of the balm of time.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_35:0.7500:None of us of the world can escape this pain of parting.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0100_36:0.7000:'Death is the last enemy that shall be overcome.' The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_16:0.7500:wifehood sounding through the wavering, feeble voice.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_17:0.5500:Michael Gregoriev, with a violent start, drew back.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_18:0.6500:He passed his hand once across his face; then, straight
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_19:0.8000:ening suddenly, and without another look at the figure
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_20:0.5500:on the bed, he turned and strode from the room, leaving
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_21:0.5000:the door open.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_22:0.5500:Behind him, silence fell again. Sophia's breathing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_30:0.5500:and let her heavy eyelids fall.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_31:0.7500:Presently, out of the night, came the voice of Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_32:0.6000:Veliki, from the distant Kremlin, booming the eleventh
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_33:0.7000:hour. As the last stroke trembled through the room
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_35:0.7000:suddenly to a sitting posture. Her eyes widened, joy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0102_36:0.5500:ously, upon some distant scene, and a cry of ecstatic
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_2:0.5000:THERE is a certain maxim, unpleasant as it is preva
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_3:0.5000:lent, indulged in with great frequency by a certain class
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_4:0.5500:of stoical sophists, to the effect that there are many sor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_5:0.5000:rows in life more difficult to bear than that separation
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_23:0.5000:During the three days that passed before the funeral,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_24:0.5000:Ivan, his brain dulled and heavy with a kind of morbid
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_25:0.5000:despair, haunted the room where his mother lay, sur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_26:0.6500:rounded with candles the lights of which illumined and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_27:0.8000:intensified the smile of transfiguration still remaining on
geniuspotter00pottiala_0104_28:0.5500:her peaceful face. To the boy, waiting and watching
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_1:0.6500:Wearily and drearily, however, the boy, with the aid of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_2:0.5500:his serf, packed the few garments he had brought with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_3:0.5500:him, and then went off to hang about the closed door of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_4:0.7500:his aunt's suite of rooms, in which, also packing, was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_5:0.8500:Nathalie: that strange, new Nathalie, born for him fif
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_6:0.6500:teen hours before.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_7:0.7000:He had reached a great depth of unhappiness when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_8:0.6000:suddenly, about noon-time, the gate to fairy -land opened
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_11:0.5500:found himself eating an early dejeuner a la fourchette with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0108_12:0.6000:his aunt and cousin, after which he drove with them
geniuspotter00pottiala_0110_35:0.6500:November passed in a whirl of powdery snow and winds
geniuspotter00pottiala_0110_36:0.7000:that cut through the heaviest furs. As the time of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0112_1:0.5500:feminine soul the world over. For the little, pearl-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0112_2:0.6500:studded bracelet that lay in a blue-velvet case in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0112_3:0.5000:breast-pocket of Ivan's coat was, considering the boy's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0112_4:0.6000:inexperience, in astonishingly appropriate taste; and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0112_5:0.6000:well calculated to recall him to the mind of the girl of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_4:0.5000:Majesty, all for presuming to interrupt her game within
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_5:0.6000:doors in order to take her for the prescribed daily walk
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_7:0.6000:Count Dravikine, his eyes narrowing with anger, ap
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_8:0.5000:proached the furious child, lifted her, now kicking fran
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_10:0.5000:wife's boudoir, and flung her before her mother. Then,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_11:0.5500:in a voice that Caroline had heard only twice before, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_12:0.5500:expressed his opinion of the up-bringing of his child,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_13:0.6000:finishing with certain forceful suggestions of change for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_14:0.6000:the future.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_15:0.6000:Countess Caroline listened without a word ; but when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_35:0.7000:orous French maid.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0116_36:0.7500:In spite of this conventional training, Nathalie, whose

geniuspotter00pottiala_0118_32:0.7000:bleak world; oblivious of all things save the white in-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0118_33:0.9000:nocency of their dreams of first, most fragile, high-ro
geniuspotter00pottiala_0120_1:0.5000:parties to the various fashionable suburbs), they left
geniuspotter00pottiala_0120_3:0.8000:pouring over the orchestro-harmonical works of Monsieur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0120_36:0.5500:behalf. Michael himself was keenly aware that, even
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_11:0.5500:found Piotr ostensibly waiting with tea.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_12:0.7000:But, unfortunately for Piotr, the young master was as
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_13:0.6000:uncommunicative as the old ; and the door to the inner
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_14:0.7500:sanctum had, throughout this interview, been shut and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_15:0.6000:bolted. Thus mere speculation was all that found tongue
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_32:0.5000:Pondering thus, Ivan inhaled his cigarette-smoke, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_34:0.7500:his nerves till, at length, his thoughts took a new turn.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_35:0.8000:Standing, as he did, upon a threshold, looking through
geniuspotter00pottiala_0122_36:0.6500:an open doorway out upon active life, he considered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0124_35:0.6000:dividuals, many of whom had travelled some versts to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0124_36:0.6000:see the train : perhaps accompanying a friend who was to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_8:0.5500:noon you are left alone, you immediately appear at one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_9:0.5000:of the best-known houses in the Admiralty quarter, where
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_10:0.7500:you seem as much at home as I myself!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_11:0.5000:Ivan echoed his companion's laugh. He had gauged
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_12:0.6500:the real depth of de Windt's conceit, and knew him to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_13:0.6000:be, at bottom, both sincere and just in his estimates of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_14:0.6000:men and things. " I ought to be at home there, at least,"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_15:0.7000:he observed, quietly. "Caroline Ivanovna Madame
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_16:0.6500:Dravikine is my aunt."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_17:0.6500:"St. Serge! And you let us dub you 'bonhomme
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_19:0.7500:had the choice of Petersburg, you could not have selected
geniuspotter00pottiala_0127_20:0.5000:a better lanceuse than Countess Caroline! On my word,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_29:0.5000:mere, deceptive, heartless mondaine.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_30:0.6000:There were, however, in the society of the Russian
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_31:0.6000:capital into which Ivan had been so swiftly drawn,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_33:0.6000:occasionally interested, their new companion and ob
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_34:0.5000:server. Petersburg was still under the stimulus of its
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_35:0.5500:changed rule. Nicholas, the Iron Czar, a man stern,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0130_36:0.5500:unlovable and unsocial, was dead. With him had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0132_1:0.6000:nothing better offers, a round of the music-halls, which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0132_2:0.6000:open only after the opera is closed. Yes, truly, after
geniuspotter00pottiala_0132_3:0.6000:one month in this land, no one will deny that Paris has
geniuspotter00pottiala_0132_4:0.7000:held too long the reputation that should belong to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0132_5:0.5000:St. Petersburg: that of the gayest of all the gay cities of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_1:0.5500:through her sister of kings that Ivan, flocking with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_2:0.5500:the rest of his world to her famous drawing-rooms, re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_33:0.5500:talents,) who carried Ivan, experimentally, to one of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_34:0.6000:these Fridays. For de Windt, who had in him, deeply
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_35:0.7000:hidden, tenderly cherished, that germ of artistic com
geniuspotter00pottiala_0133_36:0.6000:prehension that is not to be acquired by any means, di-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_5:0.6500:whereon were two unlighted samovars, flanked by golden
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_6:0.5000:platters of sandwiches, cakes and caviare, together with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_7:0.6000:piles of untouched plates.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_8:0.7000:At the entrance of the two young men, de Windt
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_9:0.5000:grasping Ivan by the arm, the Grand-Duchess turned, in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_11:0.6000:ment, she summoned them to her, with a slight gesture.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_12:0.5500:Then, breaking off her argument with Ivan's future
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_13:0.7500:biographer, she held out a hand for de Windt to salute.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_14:0.8000:"Vladimir Vassilyitch, I expected you. Have you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_15:0.8500:enrolled yourself under Zaremba yet, for proper instruc
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_17:0.5500:De Windt laughed. "Your Highness should get his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_19:0.6000:"Bah, Monsieur Impertinence! The yacht club's green
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_20:0.6000:tables see more of you than your Colonel, as we all know.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_22:0.5500:"My brother officer and good friend, Lieutenant Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_28:0.5500:den fire in his eyes. With an effort, she restrained her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_29:0.7500:self, and presently observed, in a different tone:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_30:0.7000:" I have heard of your father, Lieutenant. Are you a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_31:0.7000:musician?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_32:0.7000:A shred of color crept back into Ivan's lips; but his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_34:0.6500:voice: "I ask the pardon of your Royal Highness, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_35:0.8500:beg leave to go. The fault and the mistake of my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0135_36:0.6500:presence are entirely mine!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_1:0.7000:At these words, de Windt turned towards him, sharp
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_2:0.6000:ly ; but their hostess interrupted his first syllable:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_3:0.7000:"You have made no mistake, sir. Vladimir Vas-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_4:1.0000:silyitch is responsible for all that he does. You are, I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_5:0.8000:presume, a lover of music?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_6:0.8500:"Indeed yes, your Highness!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_7:0.9500:"You play?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_8:0.7500:Ivan, glancing towards the piano, encountered the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_9:0.8000:keen look of the world's master-pianist. " I have played
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_10:0.8500:at home, as a boy, for my mother," he answered, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_11:0.6000:last word uttered very low.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_12:0.7000:A brief silence followed his speech. The little scene
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_13:0.7500:was unusual, and had by this time caught the attention
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_14:0.5000:of the room. Ivan felt the hostile fire of many eyes
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_15:0.6500:fixed on him, and perceived dimly what they had re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_16:0.6000:solved : that he was to be tried, here, as others had been
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_17:0.7500:before him rather cruelly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_18:0.7500:Finally the Duchess herself glanced towards the piano.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_19:0.8000:"Anton, have you marked your expression?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_20:0.7000:"That is finished. But I have not as yet suggested a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_21:0.6000:fingering for the cadenza."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_22:0.6000:"No matter. Ivan Gregoriev, Monsieur Rubinstein
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_23:0.7500:has brought us a new manuscript a barcarolle, you said,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_24:0.5500:Anton ? finished to-day, and brought here to be played
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_25:0.7000:to me. He writes a clear hand. Sit down, then, and let
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_26:0.7000:us hear you interpret it."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_27:0.8500:"/, madamel"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_28:0.7000:"I said so."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_29:0.6500:Ivan flushed crimson, and then went white again.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0136_35:0.6500:having his new creation murdered by a tyro, speedily
geniuspotter00pottiala_0137_35:0.5000:only man who had heard the composition before. Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_1:0.7000:the mass of blurring notes, and substituting for the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_2:0.5000:difficulties of the accompaniment, a simple, graceful set
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_24:0.5500:cess, leaning heavily on her cane, approached the piano
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_25:0.5500:through a little lane respectfully opened for her in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_26:0.5500:throng. But it was to Rubinstein, not Ivan, that she
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_27:0.8500:addressed herself:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_28:1.0000:"What has this young man been about, Anton?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_29:0.8000:Your style is certainly very much improved!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_30:0.7000:"Your Highness, it was not my barcarolle you heard,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_31:0.6500:but a clever bit of improvisation on my theme my own
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_33:0.6500:Monsieur Gregoriev's technique."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_34:0.8000:Helena Pavlovna cast one answering look at this man
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_35:0.8000:whose musical talent was surpassed only by his well-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0138_36:0.6500:known, frantic jealousy of every possible rival. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_1:0.6000:then, taking the abashed Ivan by the hand, she turned
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_2:0.6500:and faced her guests:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_3:0.6000:"My friends, we have listened, to-night, to the de'but
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_5:0.5000:Monsieur Ivan Mikhailovitch Gregoriev, a new composer ;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_6:0.5000:one who, a Russian of Russians, shall, I predict, carry
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_7:0.5500:the songs of our country beyond herself, and proclaim
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_8:0.5500:them over civilized Europe!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_9:0.6500:A smile of self-forgetfulness, of an enthusiasm that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_10:0.5000:betrayed the beauty of her royal soul, shone upon the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_11:0.6000:lips and from the eyes of this true Princess, as Ivan, his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_12:0.7000:heart beating to suffocation, fell impetuously upon one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_13:0.6000:knee before her and raised her frail hand to his lips.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_14:0.6000:It was indeed his de'but in the Russian world of music ;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_15:0.5500:and alas! it gained for him fewer friends than enemies.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_16:0.5500:For, of all types of men and women upon earth, those
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_17:0.7000:into whom Euterpe has breathed her spirit, are certainly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0139_18:0.8500:the most practised in envy, hatred, malice and all un-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_3:0.5500:tersburg, Ivan. But you are out very early!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_4:0.5000:Ivan gave a joyous laugh. He was, as a matter of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_5:0.9000:fact, just returning from a night of festivity at the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_6:0.6500:Nobility Club. But this, naturally, was not to be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_7:0.7500:confessed.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_8:0.9000:"No earlier than you, at least, mademoiselle," he re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_9:0.7000:turned. "And will you accept my escort to wherever
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_10:0.7500:you are going?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_11:0.9000:Nathalie gave one, quick glance into the old woman's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_12:0.5500:scowling face. Then the demon of mischief entered into
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_34:0.5500:Next morning, somewhat earlier than on the previous
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_35:0.6000:day, he entered the church of the Virgin of Kazan. But
geniuspotter00pottiala_0144_36:0.7000:though for an hour and a half he saw every soul that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_3:0.5000:and eighteen miles, and about half a mile from the little
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_4:0.5000:town of that name. Thither, therefore, Ivan and Vla
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_5:0.5500:dimir were about to proceed, with their regiment.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_6:0.5500:Naturally enough every cadet, before leaving his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_9:0.5500:the existence tolerable or intolerable, were to be dis
geniuspotter00pottiala_0150_10:0.5500:covered only by experience; and, moreover, depended
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_3:0.5500:for her through the first days after her death. But Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_4:0.7500:was, at this time, little given to melancholies; and a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_6:0.6500:brought him back to realities and his man's work.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_7:0.5500:Thus, finally, on the second Monday in June, the regi
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_17:0.5000:A few days later, upon the evening of the eighteenth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_20:0.5000:street and flung himself, wearily, upon one of the two
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_22:0.5000:moments before he rose to remove his accoutrements,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_23:0.7000:his boots and his clothes, wrap himself in a most un-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0152_36:0.5000:in, and repeated the actions of his comrade. Finally,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0153_3:0.5500:at him for an instant, and then called him by name,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0153_11:0.6000:appeared between his brows, "they are discussing the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0153_12:0.6000:usual theme?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0153_13:0.5000:"All evening. It seems there are developments.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_29:0.6500:the infallible explanation of that man's behavior?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_30:0.7000:Ivan sprang to his feet. "You mean it's a woman?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_31:0.6500:Brodsky can't have married again, surely?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_32:0.7500:De Windt smiled. In his mind he marvelled a little,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_33:0.8500:even while he rejected the idea of either guile or idiocy in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_34:0.6000:Ivan's simple question. "Why the secrecy, then? and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_35:0.7500:the ill-temper? All the same it is a woman, though.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0154_36:0.8000:We've all come to that conclusion. As a matter of fact,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_1:0.5500:Ivan, Zedarovsky swears he saw her, walking down
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_4:0.5500:last train, the eleven-twenty-five, for Petersburg. She
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_5:0.8000:was going rapidly, with her head down. She wore a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_6:0.6000:thick white veil, too. And yet he swears also that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_7:0.7500:he recognized her."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_8:0.8000:"Recognized her! Great God, Vladimir, it's not it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_9:0.7000:can't be any one we know?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_11:0.7000:"Oh! Oh because that brute! It would be sick
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_12:0.8500:ening to think of a woman's even dining with him!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_13:0.6500:"That is probably precisely what she had been doing.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_14:0.6500:He's certainly getting rather reckless. But we com
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_15:0.5000:pared notes; and nobody saw him that day after five-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_16:0.5500:thirty ; and Fe*odor, his orderly, was on guard at the tent
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_17:0.7500:door all evening, the officer of the watch says. By
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_18:0.8500:Heavens, he'll have her "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_19:0.8500:"But you haven't told me whom they say she is,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_20:0.6500:Vladimir. Tell me!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_21:0.8500:De Windt hesitated, and then, lifting his eyes to Ivan's,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_22:0.5000:said, in a grave voice: " Why should you know, old chap ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_24:0.8000:thought me effeminate, de Windt, I suppose, because I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_25:0.6500:have never cared to go in for certain things. But it's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_26:0.7000:not effeminacy, believe me. It's "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_27:0.7500:" Don't, Ivan ! For Heaven's sake don't dream I want
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_28:0.7500:your confidence about any private matter. All I've
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_29:0.7500:ever thought was that you were infinitely more decent
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_30:0.8500:than the rest of us."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_31:0.5500:A faint flush crept over Ivan's face; but he waived
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_32:0.7000:the speech gravely, and renewed the question. "I do
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_33:0.5500:want to know, Vladimir; because I have a suspicion as
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_34:0.6000:to her identity. And and if it should be the one I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_35:0.8000:fear, by Heaven I've a plan that may help us! Tell
geniuspotter00pottiala_0155_36:0.5000:me her name!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_2:0.5500:singer."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_3:0.6500:Ivan's face paled slightly as he said, in a low voice:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_4:0.6000:"I had a presentiment it was she. Well, Vladimir,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_5:0.7500:wish me success! I'm going, to-morrow evening, when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_6:0.8000:I've arranged matters a little, to Brodsky's tent to pro
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_7:0.9000:test, in the name of the regiment, about his behavior."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_8:0.8500:"Ivan! Good God! He'll have you court -martialled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_9:0.9000:and dismissed from the regiment!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_10:0.8000:"He will do nothing of the sort. And if he does
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_11:0.7500:better that, than have the old Second go to utter ruin."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_12:0.6500:"But but if you will be foolhardy, at least wait
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_13:0.8000:till you've given some one of the others an opportunity.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_14:0.6000:,One of the majors, or the Adjutant, might do it with less
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_15:0.7000:danger. Give them a chance, Ivan!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_16:0.8000:"If all things were equal, Vladimir, I'd never dream
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_17:0.5500:of arrogating the interview to myself. But I have a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_18:0.6500:certain power at least, my father has, that may, per
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_19:0.6000:haps, properly used, influence Brodsky. At least, if it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_20:0.5000:does not, nothing else in the world will!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_21:0.6500:After this, though de Windt's curiosity was roused
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_30:0.6000:friend.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_31:0.6000:Amazing though it may seem, and contrary to every
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_32:0.6000:rule of novelistic heroism, Ivan was determined to do a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_33:0.5500:thing that he had been contemplating for a week: to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_35:0.6000:power of his father's map of men to bear upon Colonel
geniuspotter00pottiala_0156_36:0.5500:Brodsky of the Grenadier Guards; to return a sobered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0157_1:0.5500:and battered leader to a regiment in want ; and to rescue
geniuspotter00pottiala_0157_2:0.5500:for so Ivan put it to himself a damsel in distress
geniuspotter00pottiala_0157_3:0.5500:from the power of a brutal man, for whom she could not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0157_4:0.5000:possibly have any real affection.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0157_5:0.6000:In the officers' mess of the Second Grenadiers, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_31:0.5000:burst forth with:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_32:0.7500:"Ivan Mikhailovitch, for Heaven's sake tell us what
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_33:0.6000:has happened ! What did he say to you ? How did he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_34:0.6500:answer your accusation?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_35:0.9500:Ivan broke out into an unpleasant laugh. " He tried
geniuspotter00pottiala_0158_36:0.6500:swearing me out of his presence," said he. "But that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_8:0.5000:I speak to you, for a few minutes, on a private matter ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_9:0.6500:With a formal bow, Ivan ended his most unsatisfactory
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_10:0.5500:explanation, and left the tent again, followed eagerly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_12:0.6000:Outside, however, Ivan's behavior was unexpected.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_32:0.6000:talk with you.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_35:0.6000:Ivan read the note through twice. Then, without a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0159_36:0.5500:word, he handed it to his companion, and waited till
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_1:0.6500:the latter's ejaculation announced that he also had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_2:0.6500:grasped its significance. Then, leading the way rap
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_3:0.6500:idly to their own tent, Ivan seated himself opposite his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_12:0.5500:the life of me I can't understand her continual presence
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_13:0.7500:here in this camp, where "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_14:0.6000:The sentence died away. De Windt shook his head,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_15:0.7500:but forbore to utter his incredulity. Presently he said:

geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_29:0.6000:army."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_31:0.5500:"Pardieu, Ivan Mikhailovitch ! I begin to think I have
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_32:0.5500:never known you, before ! You in your first year out
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_33:0.6000:of the Corps -doing what not one of us dare do ! You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_35:0.7000:"Nonsense, Vladimir Vassilyitch! I tell you, I'd be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0160_36:0.7500:in the same case as the rest of you if it were not for my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0161_2:0.5000:sort of state to receive the lady!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_5:0.7000:pers of the men; and the awful scandal! But I came
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_6:0.6000:here, Lieutenant Gregoriev, to tell you the truth about
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_7:0.7500:myself."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_8:0.7500:"Sit down, mademoiselle, I beg of you! And let me
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_9:0.8000:take your cloak. So. Now may I offer you anything ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_10:0.6500:A glass of claret?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_11:0.8500:"Nothing, thank you! I must tell you about my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0162_12:0.6000:self, and ask your advice before I go. For I have no one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0163_35:0.5000:woman who is poor and yet not ugly. We should be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0164_1:0.6000:"If you are sure that your case is as serious as this,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0164_2:0.8000:you will not refuse me the pleasure you can give
geniuspotter00pottiala_0164_3:0.9000:" Monsieur!" Irina sprang to her feet, her eyes brilliant
geniuspotter00pottiala_0164_4:0.5000:with anger.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0164_5:0.6500:"You misunderstand me, mademoiselle, entirely!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_1:0.6000:address which proved to be a humble street on Vassily
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_2:0.7500:Island and found himself thinking with some pleasure
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_3:0.6000:of seeing her again.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_4:0.5000:Upon his return to his quarters, moreover, Ivan might
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_17:0.6000:It was nearly morning before the young officer could
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_19:0.5000:had now returned to the disagreeable certainty of an
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_21:0.5000:when de Windt, agog with curiosity, re-entered his own
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_22:0.6500:quarters, his comrade was sleeping so peacefully that he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_23:0.6000:could not find it in his heart to disturb Ivan till the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_24:0.6000:reveille roused the camp.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_25:0.5000:While Ivan dressed, he and de Windt held a hurried
geniuspotter00pottiala_0165_37:0.5000:it IS 1
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_1:0.5500:played round the corners of his mouth. At some yards
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_2:0.7000:from the closed tent, he paused to speak to Grigory,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_3:0.7000:Brodsky's orderly, who stood, as usual, on guard, but at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_4:0.6500:a prescribed distance.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_5:0.8500:"Grigory, I think the Colonel needs your assistance.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_6:0.6500:He is indisposed ; and you would do well to get him a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_7:0.5000:drink of vodka."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0167_8:0.5000:The man, to whom the whole progress of recent events
geniuspotter00pottiala_0168_1:0.5000:method, though in an unselfish cause, depressed him
geniuspotter00pottiala_0168_3:0.6000:how bitterly he was afterwards to rue his silence, it is
geniuspotter00pottiala_0168_4:0.5000:probable that he would have acted again in precisely the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0169_1:0.5000:though he had paid two small instalments on his debt,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0169_2:0.5500:had begun, (to Irina's secret delight, and Ivan's persist
geniuspotter00pottiala_0169_3:0.7000:ent blindness), to regard the handsome young officer
geniuspotter00pottiala_0170_27:0.6000:This year there was, however, less flitting than usual;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_1:0.5500:be presented to her sovereigns; after which it would be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_2:0.7000:understood that the charming child was in the matri
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_3:0.5500:monial market, ready to be knocked down to the highest
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_32:0.5000:on the evening of November i2th, in the year 1862,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_34:0.5500:gay vanity. Lovelier vision than this surely never
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_35:0.7000:graced the somewhat bare corridors of the labyrinth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0172_36:0.8500:ine Hermitage! For this was the night of her debut,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_1:0.5000:now as if, with the death of her unhappy sister, there
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_30:0.5000:The great formality over, Mademoiselle Nathalie was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_32:0.5000:of brilliantly uniformed men, among whom already
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_34:0.5500:searching, for a certain one. He was there; and pres
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_35:0.8000:ently, catching that look, he came to her: the handsome,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0174_36:0.6000:black-eyed cousin, whose heart was throbbing for and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_6:0.5500:such sudden perception that he stumbled through an
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_7:0.5000:excuse, and went off to seek some spot where he could
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_8:0.8000:think ; saying to himself, as he went :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_9:0.7000:"Good God! Who would have believed he could love
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_10:0.6000:like that! and she also!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_12:0.6000:insight. And it came finally to the remembrance of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0176_16:0.6000:be alarmingly unconventional. Leaning upon the arm
geniuspotter00pottiala_0178_1:0.7000:in any place, at home or abroad. You will do well not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0178_2:0.5500:to offer it, Ivan Mikhailovitch ; for I cannot have my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0178_3:0.5500:daughter's name linked with that of a Gregoriev!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0178_4:0.5000:With which brutal thrust this great lady turned coolly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0179_35:0.7000:it is crushed out of us, we are not likely ever again to.be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0179_36:0.6000:burdened with a feeling at all similar to it. Nor is it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0180_1:0.5500:often tough-fibred enough to weather the stress of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0180_35:0.5000:whom the church was nearly filled. Suddenly, before
geniuspotter00pottiala_0180_36:0.6500:he had chosen his place, he was aware of an intense
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_1:0.6500:emotion. Ere he had time to analyze it, there came
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_2:0.5000:a light touch on his arm, and he turned to face his cousin,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_3:0.5000:Nathalie, wrapped in the soft sables that matched the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_4:0.8000:momentary shade of her eyes. Behind her a young serf,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_5:0.6000:Anitchka, a foolish and romantic creature, bobbed and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_6:0.7000:grinned with pleased excitement.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_7:0.6500:Instantly Ivan saw his opportunity. A moment
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_8:0.6500:later Nathalie's attendant, with a piece of gold in her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_9:0.5500:hand, was forcing her way to a place near the altar,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_10:0.6000:whence prayers for her benefactor would presently rise.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_11:0.5500:Meantime Ivan had turned, eagerly, tremulously, to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_12:0.5000:young girl.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_13:0.7000:"Natusha! The saints have heard me at last! Oh
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_14:0.7000:Natusha, Natusha!" It seemed as if that endearing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_15:0.6500:diminutive could not leave his lips, so did he linger over
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_16:0.5000:it, while he pressed her small, gloved hands passionately
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_17:0.8000:between his bare ones.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_18:0.9500:" Oh Ivan I am glad! But I am afraid, too! I must
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_19:0.8000:tell you everything. And then we will say good-bye!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_20:0.7000:"No!" She started at the fierceness of that mono
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_21:0.8000:syllable. " Not ' good-bye.' Not yet! Not yet!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_22:0.7500:"Yes, Ivan. I am too unhappy. I must I have
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_23:0.7000:got to stop thinking about you. It is too hard, too
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_24:0.8500:miserable, the other way. And I know they will never
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_25:0.8000:let you see me again."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_26:0.7500:Ivan's reply was a tightening of his clasp on her hands.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_27:0.5500:Then he bent his head, while his brows were knitted,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_28:0.7500:anxiously. It seemed as if he could not speak. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_29:0.6000:she had opened her lips to comfort him a little when he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_30:0.8500:burst forth, huskily:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_31:0.8000:"Nathalie, I love you better than life! Will you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_32:0.7500:marry me?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_33:0.8000:"Oh! Ivan!" The child trembled. She would have
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_34:0.8500:drawn away, but that he held her tightly and strove to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_35:0.7000:look into her face. Then, suddenly, she grew braver,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0181_36:0.5000:and let her eyes meet his. In the rose -red of her fair
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_1:0.7000:face he read, ecstatically, his answer. But he was to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_2:0.7000:have yet more. Unknowing that he had read her thought,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_3:0.7000:she found her voice and whispered: "Yes!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_4:0.7500:And then, in a second, he had kissed her, upon the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_5:0.8000:mouth, there in the dusk of the little, empty chapel.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_6:0.7000:Whereafter, indeed, she would have torn herself from
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_7:0.7500:him, had he not drawn her arm through his, and started
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_8:0.8500:forward, saying, in her ear:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_9:0.8000:"Come, my dear! We are betrothed. You belong to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_10:0.6500:me, henceforth. And we are in a church. Let us go
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_11:0.5000:and see if they will marry us, here, now. I believe God
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_35:0.9000:evening, to his uncle. And so, at length, he left her,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0182_36:0.6500:half a block from the Dravikine house, and went his way
geniuspotter00pottiala_0183_1:0.6000:towards his apartment, already beginning on the fourth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_16:0.5000:Even to de Windt, however, Ivan was a long time
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_18:0.5500:triumphant? Was the step, now audible that heavy,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_19:0.6000:dragging step, the pace of a happy man ? De Windt 's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_20:0.5500:heart beat slower. His face grew grave. And then,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_22:0.5000:He walked very slowly to a sofa in the corner, and re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_32:0.5500:line ? Calf-love ? Impossible!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_33:0.7000:The oppressive silence grew heavier and more heavy.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_34:0.5000:Ivan continued to stare; but it was into vacancy now.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_35:0.7500:He was greatly startled when he felt a hand touch his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0184_36:0.7000:shoulder: a hand whose gentleness bespoke a sympathy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_2:0.5000:seen the effect of his involuntary act. At the gesture,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_3:0.6500:Ivan started, as if he had been shot. Then he drew him
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_4:0.5500:self away, violently, and sprang to his feet, turning on
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_33:0.7500:to me!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_34:0.6500:"Oh but Ivan, my dear fellow, they evidently dis
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_35:0.7500:covered your meeting this morning, and made her do
geniuspotter00pottiala_0185_36:0.7500:this little fool!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_12:0.7500:could do with my with her daughter."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_13:0.7500:"But but tell me, have they forbidden you the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_14:0.7000:house?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_15:0.8500:" She didn't say so."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_16:0.8500:"Oh well, then it'll be easy! You must carry the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_17:0.7500:girl off!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_18:0.7000:Ivan gave a violent start ; and, for one instant, the cruel
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_19:0.8500:mask dropped from his face, leaving an expression won
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_20:0.7000:derfully different. Then all the gray bitterness closed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_21:0.6000:in again. " That would be quite impossible. Why man,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_22:0.7000:consider! She herself refused me!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_23:0.7000:"Nothing of the sort! This morning she was herself.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_24:0.7500:To-night, she was repeating to you her mother's thoughts.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_25:0.6500:They coerced her. Be a man, my boy ; and I'll help you!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_26:0.6500:You two love each other ; and you've got to marry. Do
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_27:0.9000:you think you owe her nothing?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_28:0.8000:"Vladimir Vladimir you want to be kind to me.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_29:0.8000:But you don't understand. You didn't hear how that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_30:0.7000:woman insulted my race ; my blood ; yes even her own
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_31:0.7500:sister, my mother! You can't ask me to overlook that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_32:0.8500:even for Nathalie ! ' '
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_33:0.8500:And Ivan's deep groan touched the heart of the man
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_34:0.8500:that heard it.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_35:0.8500:Nevertheless, de Windt had been struck by the sudden
geniuspotter00pottiala_0186_36:0.7500:thought he had as suddenly expressed. Marriage with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_11:0.5000:despaired-of heart's desire.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_12:0.5500:This sudden frame of mind lasted for three days. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_14:0.5000:his daily tasks, meantime, in company with de Windt,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_15:0.5500:working out the details of their secret plan. It was in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_16:0.6000:pursuit of one of these that, on the afternoon of the fourth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_33:0.6500:"Madame Dravikine does she receive to-day?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_34:0.6000:" Saints behold us, Lieutenant, she may, for all I know!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0187_35:0.6500:She and my little Natusha who cried without ceas
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_1:0.5500:morning, with all their luggage, to the foreign land by
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_2:0.5500:the sea: to Germany, where it's warm, and where they
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_3:0.7500:will stay, my lady said, till summer comes again, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_4:0.6000:they can all go to Tsarskoe. Saints! You are sick too,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_5:0.7000:young sir!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_6:0.7500:But Ivan, refusing her suggestion of a glass of wine,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_7:0.6500:made a few more inquiries, found that the old woman
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_8:0.5000:had no idea of her mistress's real destination (to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_10:0.6000:many ' ') ; and at last turned blindly away and began to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_31:0.5000:leave of absence from his Colonel. The latter was a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_32:0.5500:mere form, given daily to officers at this season. He
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_34:0.6500:score, he rose, leaving his drink untouched, and started
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_35:0.9500:off in the direction of Colonel Brodsky's dwelling.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0188_36:0.7500:It was a strange thing that Ivan, in his confidence of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0189_29:0.5000:On the morning of April yth the court journal and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0189_30:0.7000:several other papers contained the announcement that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0189_35:0.6000:chamber to his Imperial Majesty Nicholas I." Further
geniuspotter00pottiala_0189_36:0.7500:down the column came another statement that, owing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_1:0.6000:to the delicate health of the bride-elect, the wedding
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_27:0.5500:Returning to his apartment, the young man held a

geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_31:0.6000:suggestion about accompanying his friend. He was not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_32:0.5000:astonished at the rejection of the proposition. But Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_33:0.7500:ensuing remark afterwards troubled him not a little.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_34:0.6500:"Don't worry, Vladimir Vassilyitch. I'm not going
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_35:0.7500:alone. There will be some one who will take excellent
geniuspotter00pottiala_0190_36:0.6500:care of me."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0191_34:0.5500:as he sat upright in his place in the reserved carriage,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_1:0.6000:opposite him trustfully unconscious, Ivan was aware
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_2:0.5500:of his mother's reproachful presence: and heard again
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_3:0.7000:the voice that had rung so dreadfully in his boyish ears :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_4:0.5500:" Remember, Ivan, what I have suffered, through a man!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_5:0.7500:Will you remember? Will you break the Gregoriev
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_6:0.8500:tradition towards women?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_7:0.7000:Once again Sophia, gentle woman, did her work.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0192_8:0.5000:Irina Petrovna opened her eyes, next day, upon a differ
geniuspotter00pottiala_0193_34:0.5000:discovered the identity of Ivan's companion. But de
geniuspotter00pottiala_0193_35:0.6500:Windt had borne the brunt of the Colonel's rage when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0194_2:0.5500:some sort of softening of the sentence pronounced upon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0194_34:0.5000:It came, that denouement well-timed: just when the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0194_35:0.6500:clubs were full to the brim, the barracks crowded, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0194_36:0.7000:city overflowing with ennuyee men and women who
geniuspotter00pottiala_0198_2:0.5000:IVAN had begun to pay his price not for a foolish
geniuspotter00pottiala_0198_27:0.5500:By the time he entered the little dining-room, where
geniuspotter00pottiala_0198_28:0.5500:the samovar already hissed upon that cosey table, to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0199_35:0.7000:ing at best: the least lucrative of all the arts because
geniuspotter00pottiala_0199_36:0.5500:it's the highest, I suppose. Now, old fellow, I under-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_1:0.6000:stand your general stand; but, for Heaven's sake, don't
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_2:0.7500:hurt me by refusing to let me lend you a rouble or two,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_3:0.5500:till you get started have made a little headway, you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_20:0.5000:"You might pity yourself, Ivan Mikhailovitch, be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_21:0.5500:cause you have just had three blows about as big as the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_22:0.5500:average man is called upon to bear throughout his life
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_23:0.6000:time. The mere fact that you haven't gone under al
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_24:0.5500:together, says a good deal for your manliness.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0200_35:0.5000:to him what he doesn't either want or expect? You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_18:0.6500:you don't know the man.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_19:0.5500:"Well, well! You see, Vladimir, that I should have
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_20:0.5500:some hundreds of roubles, in spite of everything. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_21:0.8000:that will be enough to keep me for six months, with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_22:0.9000:economy. By that time I shall prove my manhood.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_23:0.6500:Meantime, I intend that one week shall see me settled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0201_24:0.6500:in my new world."

geniuspotter00pottiala_0203_32:0.5000:Yet poor Ivan's decisive action might have been

geniuspotter00pottiala_0203_35:0.8000:from Nice an epilogue, as it were, to the finished ro
geniuspotter00pottiala_0203_36:0.5000:mance that had so inconsiderately turned itself into a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_1:0.5500:tragedy. Princess Shulka-Mirski, the intimate friend
geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_2:0.5500:of the Countess Dravikine, had received a letter, written
geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_7:0.7000:that her princess-daughter should have been preserved
geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_8:0.5000:from marriage with that infamous creature Sophia's

geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_35:0.8500:grace and disinheritance, melted away into the utter
geniuspotter00pottiala_0204_36:0.7000:oblivion of the twice-told, the old, and the stale.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0205_35:0.7500:rocking-chair, by the open dormer of his attic-room, in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0208_36:0.8000:and with an air; but immediately spoiled it all by ex-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_1:0.6000:plaining that he did not want to learn to play any in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_2:0.5500:strument ; but was finding out the kind of sounds made
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_3:0.5500:by each one. As if any but a person born silly could
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_4:0.5000:care to learn that ! And she did not think Mr. Gregorie v
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_5:0.8500:exactly a fool or, at least, weak-brained.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_6:0.6500:Well, he had gone on, and lived with her till four years
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_7:0.7000:rolled round, and it was May again the May of 1866;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_8:0.6500:when Ivan, who looked thirty and more, was not yet
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_30:0.5000:"We meet again. Henceforth let us traverse together
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_31:0.6000:the appointed road."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_32:0.7000:In that hour it seemed as if a great wave of under
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_33:0.5500:standing and of welcome overswept Ivan; and when it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_34:0.6500:had passed , he knew that the soul of him had undergone
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_35:0.7000:a change: the great change for which he had not dared
geniuspotter00pottiala_0209_36:0.5000:to hope. The evil consequences of his long months of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_1:0.6000:pampering disappeared. Regret for what had been
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_2:0.5000:grew faint. He was glad of the present: he held out
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_3:0.6500:glad arms to the future that future of labor, possibly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_4:0.7000:thankless, which he was to dread no more. In fact, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_5:0.7000:was become a man, honest and clean and strong; and,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_35:0.5500:of manuscript music to be copied into parts for which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0210_36:0.5000:work the pay was good. Such tasks, he was assured,

geniuspotter00pottiala_0213_2:0.6500:gers could scarcely move across the keys, no one noticed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0213_3:0.5000:it save, perhaps, his hostess, who surely, in her beauti
geniuspotter00pottiala_0214_2:0.5000:of the burdens of manhood, of new ambitions; the de
geniuspotter00pottiala_0214_36:0.5000:their heads over him, wondered how his pride was to be

geniuspotter00pottiala_0215_21:0.5500:bend beyond the half-way house hid tremendous possi
geniuspotter00pottiala_0215_22:0.6500:bilities.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0215_23:0.7000:It was the afternoon of the i6th of the month. Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0215_25:0.6500:for an orchestra overture, when the door of his old
geniuspotter00pottiala_0215_26:0.7000:attic opened, unceremoniously, and Nicholas Rubinstein
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_2:0.5500:IVAN rose from his place, smiling a welcome. In spite
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_15:0.5000:"I'm interrupting your work," he remarked, as Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_16:0.8000:shoved his copy to one side and seated himself also.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_17:0.6000:"Yes, I'm interrupting; but you can spare the time, I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_18:0.6500:believe, considering my errand."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_19:0.8500:"I've plenty of time. But there's no trouble in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_20:0.7000:Vienna, no accident, I hope?" Ivan's tone took on a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_21:0.6500:shade of anxiety.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_22:0.7500:Nicholas, who was engaged in lighting a very black
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_23:0.5000:cigar, did not answer till the blue smoke was rolling up
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_24:0.5500:satisfactorily. Then he replied: " No, I left there a week
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_25:0.5000:ago. Anton is with Bruckner and one or two others,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_26:0.6000:and didn't need me. But I well, there's a most annoy
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_27:0.7000:ing business about this Moscow affair!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0216_28:0.6500:" What ? The new Conservatoire ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0217_26:0.5000:"Um a oh this new man we hear of Monsieur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_1:0.5500:There was a pause. Ivan, at the end of his sugges
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_2:0.5500:tions, began to feel puzzled at Rubinstein's coming to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_3:0.7000:him with such questions at all. Presently, however, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_4:0.7000:decided that this was not the real object of the visit;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_5:0.6000:and asked, with a change of tone: "Well, have you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_6:0.8000:some new work for me? Some copying?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_7:0.8000:"I've got some new work for you, certainly. But not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_8:0.8500:copying."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_9:0.9000:"What then?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_10:0.8500:"Well this. I want you to leave here for Moscow,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_11:0.8500:with me, in five days; and prepare to take Serov's place
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_12:0.8500:in the new Conservatoire."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_13:0.9000:"What!" The exclamation was low, and absolutely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_14:0.9000:^incredulous.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_15:0.5500:"You heard me. Aren't you perfectly well fitted to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_16:0.8000:teach theory and harmony laws, and the principles of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_18:0.6500:roubles a month ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_19:0.6500:Before Nicholas had finished, Ivan jumped to his feet
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_25:0.5500:his sudden proposition to sink home. He was unpre
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_27:0.7500:in front of him, saying, hurriedly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_28:0.9000:" You know I was born in Moscow ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_29:0.8500:"I have heard it."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_30:0.9500:"My father lives there."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_31:0.9500:"That will be fortunate for you."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_32:0.9500:"Oh! but he I'm disinherited, you know! And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_33:0.8000:where should I live, there, on my hundred roubles a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_34:0.6500:month ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0218_35:0.8000:" Well, it is not a large sum ; but it can be done. Be

geniuspotter00pottiala_0224_31:0.5000:Three hours later, in a comfortable little room on the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0224_32:0.5000:third floor of a dingy house of the Brionsovskaia, three
geniuspotter00pottiala_0224_33:0.6000:men, who had been lingering over a hearty supper, rose
geniuspotter00pottiala_0224_34:0.7500:to their feet, glasses in hand, to repeat the toast just sug
geniuspotter00pottiala_0226_1:0.5000:an astonishingly mistaken notion of what that life was

geniuspotter00pottiala_0226_35:0.8000:under baffled attempts to compose against the Devil's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0226_36:0.6000:Chorus rising to heaven from every side, he sought, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0228_35:0.5000:the welcome if astonishing news that Ivan, whose classes
geniuspotter00pottiala_0228_36:0.5000:had grown rapidly, was to have an assistant, in the per-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0230_35:0.6000:impromptu replies; a little discreet cheering; the cus
geniuspotter00pottiala_0230_36:0.6000:tomary toasts to the Czar and the persons and the subject

geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_22:0.5500:Refusing every demand for an encore, Ivan rose, in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_24:0.6000:virtuoso of the world by the arm, led him to the piano.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_26:0.7000:pointment he had lately had to endure. For every face
geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_28:0.5500:for him and his tact.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_29:0.5000:Rubinstein played well, that night; for it was one of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0231_35:0.5500:sat down to a convivial little supper, at which, before
geniuspotter00pottiala_0232_1:0.5500:Darjomizky, and, lastly, Monsieur Gounod, who had not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0232_5:0.5000:gladly have fled, had it not been for the shouts of ap
geniuspotter00pottiala_0232_32:0.5500:When he was left alone, Ivan installed himself at a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0232_34:0.9500:who should approach the house, either on foot or driving.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0232_35:0.5000:He had, for company, the last of G6g61's semi-tragic
geniuspotter00pottiala_0234_1:0.7500:every thought, every memory, of everything save the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0234_35:0.5000:become familiar to and dreaded by all who cared for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0234_36:0.5500:him. He kept himself in a constant state of exhaustion,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_22:0.5500:pushed noiselessly aside, and a servitor in livery appeared,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_24:0.5000:"The Herr Direktor!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_25:0.6000:At once Zaremba, tall, angular, round-shouldered, his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_26:0.5500:fluffy reddish hair and side whiskers looking thinner and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_27:0.6500:fluffier than ever, entered, throwing the garments which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_28:0.5500:he had refused the footman down upon one end of a long,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_29:0.6000:Turkish divan.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_30:0.6500:Then the new-comer advanced, deliberately, to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_32:0.5500:returned the long, white-faced stare with which Rubin
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_33:0.9500:stein greeted him. Finally the head of the Conservatoire
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_34:0.9000:uttered a dry:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0236_35:0.6000:"Well?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_19:0.5000:it took two hours before he would allow Zaremba, his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_20:0.7000:remnant of a conscience once more deadened by the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_21:0.6500:combined forces of Rubinstein's magnetism, covert
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_23:0.6000:The result of their talk bore immediate fruit. Late
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_34:0.6500:pale.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_35:0.7000:It was a half -hour before his door was opened, after a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0238_36:0.5000:dozen unanswered knocks, and the room invaded by
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_2:0.6000:AT this unprecedented spectacle Nicholas halted, ab
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_3:0.5500:ruptly, uttering some unintelligible exclamation. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_4:0.5000:Ivan, deep as he was buried beneath his weight of de
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_5:0.7000:spair, heard the sound, and reluctantly raised himself,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_6:0.7500:at the same time grasping the letter anew, till the in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_7:0.6000:truder's attention was reattracted by the rustle.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_8:0.7500:"Aha!" said he, softly; laying a gentle hand on the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_9:0.8500:young man's shoulder. " It is thy father that is gone ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_10:0.7000:"Gone? My father? Where?" muttered Ivan, stu
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_11:0.7500:pidly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_12:0.6000:"You are in grief. Is it the death of some one near ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_13:0.6500:Then, perceiving at last the drift of his friend's sym
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_14:0.6000:pathy, Ivan burst into a harsh, unpleasant laugh. " Oh
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_15:0.7500:yes: it is a death. It is the death of a very ancient
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_16:0.6000:vanity of mine: a silly idea that I that I had a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_17:0.7500:talent!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_18:0.8000:Rubinstein's friendly face took on an expression of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_19:0.7000:slow bewilderment, which began presently to soften into
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_20:0.7500:a concern whereat, once more, his companion uttered his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_21:0.7000:mirthless laugh.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_22:0.7000:"Oh, I'm not mad, Nicholas Nikolaitch! You re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_23:0.7500:member my old symphony, and Litoritch's criticism
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_24:0.6500:when I sent it up to him ? Well, I was fool enough then
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_25:0.6000:not to understand : to go on believing that I could
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_26:0.7000:write music!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_27:0.7500:"Precisely as you can," returned the other, roughly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0240_28:0.5000:Ivan's face quivered and softened. " No. I will tell
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_1:0.6000:towered so securely and so high! And yet had not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_2:0.5000:this same belittling blemish been the bugbear of his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_3:0.6500:own, generous existence? Was anything impossible in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_4:0.5500:one whom he had known again and again to stoop to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_32:0.6000:tracted sleep, Rubinstein's pupils at the Conservatoire
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_33:0.5500:were undergoing three hours of remarkable instruction.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_35:0.8000:failed to point out to him a given number of chords of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0242_36:0.6000:the ninth and seventh, augmented or diminished, in a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0243_34:0.5500:for my highly uncomfortable journey," returned Nich
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_1:0.6500:to fury. " It's your miserably selfish treatment of young
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_2:0.6000:Gregoriev and his work that's brought me up here so
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_3:0.6000:inconveniently."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_4:0.6500:Anton turned on his brother, his eyes blazing with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_5:0.6500:swift rage. But Nicholas, with a single glance from his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_6:0.5500:calm, mocking, but deeply penetrating eyes, once more
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_8:0.7000:so utterly in your good faith, the impartial judgment
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_10:0.5000:very blood is green, would be moved if you could hear
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_11:0.5500:him. However where's the manuscript of the boy's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_12:0.7000:tone-poem?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_13:0.7500:"'Tone-poem!' Eureka! Do you imagine that it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_14:0.7000:actually is music? as he believes it, no doubt, to be?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_15:0.6000:Still, the rot is safe enough where you'll not soon lay
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_16:0.5500:your hands on "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_17:0.6500:The voice of the Jew was silenced perforce ; for the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_19:0.5000:powerful, full of the righteous anger of a strong man
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_21:0.7000:supper-party finally lay back in his own chair, panting
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_22:0.6500:and wriggling with pain, his mood had changed, per
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_23:0.7500:ceptibly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_24:0.8500:"Have you dared," demanded Nicholas, in a voice
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_25:0.9500:low and trembling, "to burn the first masterpiece of a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_26:0.9500:genius?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_27:0.8500:"I told you it was safe."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_28:1.0000:"Do you imagine I believe Ah well! I take it back
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_29:0.9000:to Moscow with me, to-morrow."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_30:0.8000:At these words, the smouldering fire in the other's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_31:0.6500:wretched heart leaped up again, and he cried, furiously:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_32:0.5500:"You lie! It is not a masterpiece! Even Zaremba said
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_33:0.7000:that every idea in it had been stolen from me! The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_34:0.7000:thing shall never be played until 7 choose!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_35:0.8500:"Anton, are you mad? Can you actually heed any
geniuspotter00pottiala_0244_36:0.6500:thing said to you by the jackal who endures your
geniuspotter00pottiala_0248_29:0.5000:greater part of this bumptious paragraph was true.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0248_35:0.6000:Ivan from his holiday. But Anton, who was in a de
geniuspotter00pottiala_0248_36:0.5500:jected mood, made no great objection when Ivan, filled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_1:0.6500:which now amounted to the princely sum of eighteen
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_2:0.6000:hundred roubles a year, offered his whilom servant wages
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_3:0.6500:so good that the fellow thenceforth actually refrained
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_4:0.7500:from any commission on the marketing and those other
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_24:0.5000:"But but good Heaven!" stammered Ivan, in a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_25:0.6500:flutter of excitement and incredulity, "it is impossible!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_26:0.6000:Conduct! I cannot do it! It it is impossible!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_27:0.8500:The trouble in Rubinstein's mind now stepped forth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_28:0.7500:to his face. "Could you not try, Ivan? I want so
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_29:0.6500:much to see you and Anton quite reconciled. And he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_30:0.7500:has suggested this, I think, to prove his friendship."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_31:0.7000:(Simple-hearted brother! Why could he not remem
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_32:0.5000:ber that Anton was as fully aware as himself of Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_33:0.7000:inexperience in the art, seemingly so simple, really in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0250_35:0.7500:Poor Ivan was as innocent in the matter as Nicholas
geniuspotter00pottiala_0252_1:0.5500:He sat quietly in his leathern chair, or paced rapidly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0252_2:0.5000:about the room, occasionally seating himself at the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0252_3:0.5000:piano and rippling off portions of the work that was to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0252_4:0.6000:be judged at last by the dread tribunal, whose final
geniuspotter00pottiala_0252_5:0.5000:verdict was not to be reversed: the supreme court of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0253_1:0.6000:within seven days of the concert before Nicholas, learn
geniuspotter00pottiala_0253_3:0.5500:brother, to seek an explanation and voice a protest.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0253_6:0.7500:the occupations that had prevented him from appearing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0253_7:0.6000:at rehearsal. He showed his brother a dozen of Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0253_36:0.6500:During five of these, the great pianist stood where he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0254_1:0.6500:had been left, staring down at the floor, an expression
geniuspotter00pottiala_0256_32:0.5000:The hand-clapping died away. Ivan turned, mounted
geniuspotter00pottiala_0256_33:0.5000:his desk, and lifted the black baton. He rapped, once,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0256_35:0.8000:rapped twice, and saw thirty bows lifted in air. Then
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_1:0.6000:of amusement. The thing was really too absurd for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_3:0.6000:Ivan's heart stopped beating. In all his mind there
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_14:0.5000:apologizing earnestly for the sudden illness of young
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_24:0.6000:cream of Moscow's society!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_25:0.5000:Moscow society, indeed ; but also representatives from
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_29:0.5000:concealing cloak, walked rapidly towards the street,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_30:0.6000:and had soon left far behind the Grand Theatre, and his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_31:0.5500:last dream of reconciliation with his son.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_32:0.5500:Late in the afternoon of the following day, the direc
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_33:0.6000:tors of the Moscow Conservatoire of Music held a spon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_34:0.8000:taneous meeting, which the presence of four men over
geniuspotter00pottiala_0258_35:0.6500:a quorum rendered formal. It was for the purpose
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_30:0.7000:brought with me, for signing, the contracts covering the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_31:0.8500:production, to be made on New Year's night, of your
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_32:0.7000:opera, "The Boyar."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_33:0.7000:Ivan stiffened for an instant; then sank dully back,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_34:0.7500:saying, without a whit of expression in his voice: " Don't
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_35:0.8500:tease me any further about old visions, Nikolai. Even
geniuspotter00pottiala_0260_36:0.5000:from you that comes hard."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_1:0.6500:refined torture, in the course of which every one of his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_3:0.6000:situations, the choicest of his originalities, were ruth
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_4:0.5000:lessly cut, altered, or swept calmly away: a perfectly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_5:0.5500:correct and artistic proceeding, and agreeable to every
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_25:0.5000:Most of these humiliations, it soon appeared, were to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0262_35:0.5000:out of his head to set about such a thing! Ivan, it is
geniuspotter00pottiala_0264_18:0.6000:Next morning, at ten o'clock, Ivan heard his quartet
geniuspotter00pottiala_0264_19:0.5000:sung with a strictness of tempo, rhythm, and expression,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0264_20:0.5000:far surpassing anything yet accomplished by any of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0266_32:0.5000:The great Kremlin clock sent twelve, slow strokes
geniuspotter00pottiala_0266_33:0.6500:booming through the frosty air. Ivan started, suddenly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0266_34:0.7000:By now, at least, the performance must be at an end!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0266_35:0.8500:And nobody had come to him ! They had all dreaded
geniuspotter00pottiala_0266_36:0.5000:the breaking of the news. Even S6sha: Then it had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_1:0.5500:Boyar is the opera of the century; and you are the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_2:0.7000:man of "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_3:0.9000:He stopped, perforce. Ivan's arms had risen, trem
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_4:0.8000:bling. His lips had uttered one, slight cry. And then,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_5:0.7500:without warning, he pitched forward, over the tumbled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0268_6:0.5000:wreaths, into the waiting bosom of his gods.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0269_2:0.5000:MORNING, with its usual mood of depressed calm,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0269_28:0.5000:To the indignation of the prima-donna, however, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_3:0.6000:allowed to retain the role. But Ivan had the relief of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_4:0.5000:seeing Finocchi of the hopeless ear replaced by Limpa-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_5:0.7000:dello, through whom the quartet was now firmly united
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_28:0.6000:rooms, he found upon his table a sealed envelope, un-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_31:0.6000:slip of paper containing, in his father's writing, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_32:0.6500:words :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_33:0.8000:"You have deserved this; but I do not wish to see
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_34:0.8000:you."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0270_35:0.8000:The wish was obeyed. But the money, after some
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_10:0.5000:them.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_11:0.6500:Angered, hurt as these men were, they naturally put
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_13:0.5000:One only of them all, and he, had they but known it,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_14:0.6000:the most deeply hurt, failed to censure, and guessed at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_15:0.5000:something like the truth: that the young man, suddenly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0271_36:0.5500:The quarter to which Ivan turned for his recreation
geniuspotter00pottiala_0274_32:0.5000:among the sincere members of the youthful army, other
geniuspotter00pottiala_0274_34:0.6500:to sow seeds of evil and of suffering among them. For
geniuspotter00pottiala_0274_35:0.7500:out of the fermentation arising among these isolated
geniuspotter00pottiala_0274_36:0.6500:bands, came the bitterest drink that Russia has had to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0276_19:0.5000:The brief chapter of Ivan's life in the student quarter
geniuspotter00pottiala_0276_20:0.6500:proceeded merrily to its dramatic close; and, until that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_26:0.6000:upon the same, or the next, page. Monsieur Gregoriev should
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_27:0.5000:be better acquainted with the guests whom he honors by his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_28:0.5500:invitations.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_30:0.5500:As his eyes traversed the last line, Ivan trembled a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_32:0.6000:How long ago since he had heard it. His mother!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_33:0.5000:His mother's name used in a denunciation ? Faugh! It
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_34:0.8500:was a trap. Nevertheless he sat rigid, frowning, lost in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0277_35:0.5500:thought, for many minutes before he lifted the other
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_1:0.5000:missive, addressed this time in a hand that seemed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_2:0.5500:vaguely familiar.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_10:0.5500:show this to Serge, or to any one we know.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_11:0.7000:" Ivan, I wish to help you. Believe that, and accept the

geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_22:0.5500:room to dress.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_23:0.6500:Ten minutes later he opened the outer door of his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_24:0.6000:apartment. As he stepped out upon the landing, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_25:0.7500:twisted his foot in a sudden effort to avoid stepping on a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_26:0.8000:white envelope that had been pushed half-way under
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_27:0.7500:the door.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_28:0.7500:So there were more of them !
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_29:0.6500:Laughing, a little sardonically, Ivan picked up the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_30:0.6000:letter and turned back into his living-room again. The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_31:0.9000:envelope of this missive, unlike the others, bore only his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_32:0.7500:name, not the address. Within, it was undated, un
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_34:0.5500:"Monsieur Ivan Mikhailovitch Gregoriev, of whom, politically,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0278_35:0.5500:the government as yet knows no wrong, is nevertheless respect-

geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_1:0.5000:applauded wildly as she smilingly climbed upon her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_2:0.8500:chair, and, holding the replenished glass in her right
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_3:0.5000:hand, began one of the most successful solos in Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_23:0.5500:tion that singularly resembled terror. Her brother and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_25:0.6000:But Ivan proved himself admirable. Rising, quietly,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_26:0.7000:he went forward, and asked, in a voice of mingled sur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_27:0.8000:prise and dignity:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_28:0.9000:" Who are you, may I ask? and what can your errand
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_29:0.9000:be with me or with my guests?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_30:0.8500:The sergeant, after another long look around the room,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_31:0.9000:consulted a paper in his hand and asked, slowly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_32:0.8000:"You are Monsieur Ivan Gregoriev?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_33:0.8000:"I am."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_34:0.8500:"There are others here?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0282_35:0.6500:"You see them."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_2:0.7000:the kitchen."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_3:0.9000:" It's not them we want. What are the names of these
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_4:0.6500:persons?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_5:0.5500:" What right have you to ask ? This house "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_6:0.7000:"I am an officer in the service of the Czar. If you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_7:0.5500:refuse to answer me I must take you forcibly before the

geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_17:0.6000:pure force of contact.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_18:0.6000:Meantime the officer was writing the names, occupa
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_19:0.6000:tions, and domiciles, of every one present, at Ivan's dic
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_20:0.6500:tation; and, as each was given, he looked it out from a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_21:0.8000:list in his small, black note-book, and checked it off.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_22:0.8500:This over, he resumed his general questions:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_23:0.8500:"At what hour did these students arrive in your
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_24:0.7500:rooms?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_25:0.9000:" I am not certain. A few minutes perhaps fifteen
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_26:0.5000:before six."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_27:0.6000:"Before the hour?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_28:0.7500:"Oh yes. We had to wait for Ivan Veliki to stop
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_29:0.8500:striking as I was calling out an order to my servant."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_30:0.5000:" Are you sure that they were all here then ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_31:0.7500:Only now, for the first time, a thought that was like
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_32:0.5500:a dagger-thrust shot through Ivan. He wondered if the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_33:0.7500:officer saw the color leave his face. Nevertheless his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_34:0.6500:hesitation had been imperceptible when he said, quietly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_35:0.7500:"They all came in together."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0283_36:0.8000:The sergeant turned to his men and shook his head
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_1:0.5000:slightly. A few muttered words passed between them,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_2:0.5000:the men seeming to agree with their superior. Then
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_13:0.5000:room and the apartment.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_14:0.7500:Mechanically Ivan closed the door upon them, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_15:0.5000:then stood staring from the white-faced Sergius to Irina,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_16:0.7000:now supported by a neighbor, who was wetting her face
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_17:0.6000:with water from a goblet.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_18:0.9000:Presently, as if his thoughts had broken unconsciously
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_19:0.8000:into words, Ivan muttered, in a low, expressionless voice:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_20:0.6500:"Anarchy ! Murder! Good God why didn't they
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_21:0.7500:make it my father?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_22:0.7500:Then Burevsky rose slowly to his feet. "We all re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_23:0.5500:joice, Ivan, for and with you, that it was not your father.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_24:0.5500:And you have saved me from from a serious dif
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_25:0.6000:ficulty. If you had told them that I -that I did not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_26:0.7000:come with the others
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_27:0.7500:Ivan gave the spectre of a laugh. "Your chemistry
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_28:0.8000:should have served you, Yevgeny Alexandrovitch. Still
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_29:0.6000:the lie probably prevented annoyance to you all.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_30:0.6000:Ah, these Nihilists! What remarkable fellows they
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_31:0.6500:"Ivan, we will go now. Irina is recovering," inter
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_32:0.5500:rupted Sergius, gravely. To Ivan's dull surprise, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_33:0.6500:young fellow's eyes met his full and honestly. In
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_34:0.6500:voluntarily Ivan shuddered; but a little of the convul
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_35:0.8000:sive bitterness in his heart faded away. Nevertheless,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0284_36:0.6000:he took a curious advantage of the situation. Far from
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_1:0.5000:wherein the spring sunshine only showed up all the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_12:0.6000:and lighted a pipe, seated himself at the battered piano
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_13:0.5000:sole remaining relic of old Petrov Lihnoff, and now
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_14:0.5500:too dilapidated for sale and yielded himself for an
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_16:0.6000:poser: improvisation.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_17:0.7500:Interested in the little theme he had developed, Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_18:0.6000:lost count of time, and nearly two hours passed before
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_22:0.6500:left hand hanging, crushed and bloody, at his side, in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_23:0.8000:his right a pistol, its barrel glinting in the light.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_24:0.7000:Ivan was on his feet, facing the other, who stared at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_25:0.6500:him as he gasped, between his quick breaths:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_26:0.8500:" You, Gregoriev! You ! Go, instantly! Leave the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_27:0.9500:house at the back ; there may be time ! You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_28:0.7500:"But for God's sake, Burevsky, what's the matter?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_29:0.7500:Where are Sergius and Irina?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_30:0.7000:"Irina got away, thank God! We managed that,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_31:0.5500:last night. See here, Ivan, she's at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_32:0.7500:The next word was drowned in the sharp report of a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_33:0.5500:pistol-shot, which was instantly followed by another.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0288_35:0.8500:cry, the screams of some women in the lower rooms, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0290_34:0.5000:There was some manifestation of surprise at Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0290_35:0.7000:appearance; but he was at once seized, handcuffed, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0290_36:0.6000:provided likewise with ankle-chains, which permitted
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_6:0.5000:destination. That was the gubernatorial palace: sure
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_9:0.6500:It was as they were finally alighting from the vehi-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_10:0.7000:'cle that Ivan's companion, Stassov, managed at last to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_11:0.7000:speak, in a whisper so rapid and so low that Ivan barely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_12:0.7000:caught it:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_13:0.8500:"We get our trial now. This examination will be all
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_14:0.7500:we'll have. Be careful."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_15:0.7500:Then, for the first time, Ivan's heart sank, terribly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_16:0.6500:Another instant, and it was in his throat. Their destina
geniuspotter00pottiala_0292_17:0.5500:tion had not been the palace of the Governor; but that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0293_36:0.5000:resentful, that Ivan, concealing his face by keeping his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_1:0.6000:head bent down, followed his father's old servitor along
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_2:0.6500:the short passage to the closed door of Prince Michael's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_3:0.7500:cabinet. Immediately there came a word of command
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_4:0.5000:from within. The door was opened, and Ivan was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_24:0.5000:for never before had man beheld Michael Gregoriev
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_25:0.8000:show such stress of emotion. Never had any hour so
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_26:0.7000:clearly revealed the ravages of mad living and secret
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_27:0.5000:unhappiness.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0294_35:0.6000:unexpected stoop of the powerful shoulders, the occa
geniuspotter00pottiala_0295_28:0.6000:"I have not. I am the second Professor of harmony
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_1:0.5000:Ivan gave a weary sigh. "Because I have been an
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_2:0.5000:unspeakable fool: because I was tired; and had been
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_3:0.5500:working long, and hard. I chose some new companions ;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_4:0.7000:and now I find I entertained assassins unawares."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_5:0.7000:At this, the reflected gleam of a smile flickered across
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_6:0.7000:Michael's face. His hands relaxed. "Tell me the story
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_7:0.7000:all of it," he said. Nor would the prisoners waiting
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_8:0.7500:for their comrade, nor yet the guards that attended them,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_9:0.6000:have believed their ears could they have heard the tone
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_11:0.6000:Without preface, and without apology, Ivan began
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_21:0.5500:"But the woman! Lihnoff's sister, Irina, who has
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_22:0.5500:managed to get away from my fools for the moment?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_23:0.6000:Where is she, Ivan? You owe her one turn for drag
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_24:0.7500:ging you into your disgrace six years ago. Give me
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_25:0.8500:the information, and you shall go."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_26:0.7500:Ivan's lip curled. " Spy's wages! I am no informer,"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_27:0.7000:he jerked out, his heart sinking within him, nevertheless.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_28:0.5000:Gregoriev leaped to his feet in fury. Almost as quick
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_29:0.5500:ly he was back in his chair again. This conflict to re
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_30:0.5000:tain his temper was so new to him and his repeated out
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_32:0.8500:laughed had the situation been different. However,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_33:0.6500:when he spoke again, Michael's voice was quiet enough,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_34:0.7500:though touched with irony:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_35:0.9000:"So actually you are in love with her still!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0296_36:0.6500:"Neither now nor ever," Ivan answered, steady-eyed.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0297_3:0.7500:"Thank God, I don't know!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0297_5:0.7000:" Burevsky was shot with the name of the place on his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0297_6:0.6000:lips unspoken . ' '
geniuspotter00pottiala_0297_7:0.5000:Michael's brows were drawn and frowning. "You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_1:0.6500:exception. I swear to you that the only person Irina
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_2:0.6500:is dangerous to, is herself."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_3:0.6500:There ended Ivan's fight for the girl. The rest of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_4:0.7500:struggle, and it was a fierce one, passed silently within
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_5:0.6000:his father's breast. Ten unbearable minutes, and then,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_6:0.5000:Michael raised his hand.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_25:0.5500:as he reached the bottom of the entrance stairs of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0298_26:0.7500:palace, and burst into a fit of uncontrollable, hysterical
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_1:0.5500:Naturally, then, the decision arrived at was, that Gre-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_2:0.5500:goriev's nature was not to be forced. Theirs would be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_3:0.5500:the loss should they repudiate him now. When he de
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_4:0.6500:sired them, he would find them within call: this last
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_6:0.5000:Meantime, Ivan's nature, even in unhappiness, called
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_32:0.6000:It was a morning of mid -July, sweet-aired, hot-sunned,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_34:0.7000:turned the pulsating satin to a white-sheened, crinkly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_35:0.6000:azure velvet. About eight of the morning the three
geniuspotter00pottiala_0300_36:0.7500:men, each brain teeming with its own ambitions and its
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_1:0.5000:peculiar appreciation of the mysterious Mother, started
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_11:0.5000:sian to say, softly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_12:0.7000:"She is abstract enough elusive, rainbow -hued
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_13:0.6000:enough, for your harmonies, Ivan Mikhailovitch. Be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_14:0.8000:hold a tone-poem ready to your hand!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_15:0.8000:Ivan halted, quickly lifting his head, as an animal who
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_16:0.9000:scents something: "You think so? An entire tone-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_17:0.8500:poem?" The tone was alive with attentiveness.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_18:0.7000:"Why not?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_19:0.5000:"Ah a little too fragile too wanting in discord."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_33:0.5000:No necessity for this, fortunately. Balakirev, bigger,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_34:0.5500:perhaps, in generosity than any other musician of any
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_35:0.7500:time, known purveyor of ideas for men even smaller than
geniuspotter00pottiala_0301_36:0.6000:he in accomplishment, forced Gregoriev's eyes -to meet
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_2:0.6000:slow smile, these words were added :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_3:0.5500:"I call you to witness, Kashkine, that our Ivan here
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_5:0.6500:the condition being that we listen to the manuscript on
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_8:0.5000:nected with Russia can fire me. You are bigger uni
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_9:0.5500:versal. Take this tragedy, then, and write it again for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0302_10:0.5000:us in music."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_1:0.6000:Ay, truly, the bad blood that ran in his veins was his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_2:0.7000:only inheritance! Family had he none. This appalling
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_3:0.7500:solitude must, plainly, be henceforth his portion: neither
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_4:0.6000:man nor woman should he trust again.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_5:0.6500:So ran the black reveries; for he was in the throes
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_9:0.5500:tellect that race has known, has sooner or later become
geniuspotter00pottiala_0303_10:0.6500:a prey, from the great Peter down to the littlest Ro
geniuspotter00pottiala_0304_1:0.6000:of humanity in pain ? It has come to be known as the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0304_8:0.5000:great reward of him who has made complete sacrifice
geniuspotter00pottiala_0304_10:0.6000:not into its own.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0304_12:0.5500:together: Kashkine on his way to Germany, for a concert
geniuspotter00pottiala_0305_30:0.6500:empty as his heart.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0305_32:0.5000:his children well. The Ophelia he carried to Balaki-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0305_35:0.6500:its delicacy, the perfection of the reconceived master
geniuspotter00pottiala_0305_36:0.5500:piece. Next morning Nicholas sent its composer word
geniuspotter00pottiala_0306_1:0.6000:that he would play it at the fifth concert of his regular
geniuspotter00pottiala_0306_3:0.6500:satisfied; for these concerts were the musical events of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0306_4:0.6000:Moscow ; and the new work was assured of a performance
geniuspotter00pottiala_0307_4:0.5000:for the north, addressed to the Director of the Peters
geniuspotter00pottiala_0307_6:0.6500:tion of nervous irritability that kept his every pupil in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0307_7:0.5000:a state of petrified wretchedness throughout the work
geniuspotter00pottiala_0307_9:0.5500:Miserable Ivan! Zaremba too even Zaremba, was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0307_10:0.6000:in the throes of composition ! He was attempting a work
geniuspotter00pottiala_0308_33:0.6000:gramme.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0308_34:0.5500:Rubinstein stoutly refused ; and, the more he was en
geniuspotter00pottiala_0308_35:0.6500:treated, the more stubborn did he grow, till he had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0308_36:0.8500:actually argued himself from a position of doubt into a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0310_35:0.6500:in the winter of 1865, with one of the early works of Peter Illich
geniuspotter00pottiala_0310_36:0.5000:Tchaikowsky.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0311_32:0.5000:For the first time, doubt of his opera began to stir in his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0311_35:0.7500:very room, and had tried to hearten him, came to him
geniuspotter00pottiala_0311_36:0.6000:as a premonition of doom. How was he to be heartened
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_1:0.6000:now after so many more years of failure ? Nay with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_2:0.6000:a half -smile, Ivan laid his recent purchase on the window-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_27:0.5500:pupil of mine; and, after a careful reading, I feel that the great
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_29:0.8000:till you are able to laugh at your wild idea of its possible per
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_30:0.8000:formance.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_31:0.5000:"Accept, my dear pupil, the remembrances of,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_33:0.5500:Slowly at first, then with more rapidity, Ivan read the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_34:0.5500:letter through. Even after he had noted the signature,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_35:0.5500:he continued to hold the sheet in his hands, while his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_37:0.6000:three, five minutes passed. Then he placed the paper
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_38:0.8500:carefully on the table, dropped into a chair by its side,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0312_39:0.7000:and seemed to meditate.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0313_12:0.5000:was roused by his master commanding tea at once, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0314_1:0.5000:which, striking him always in one spot, had rendered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0314_2:0.5000:him exquisitely sensitive. Now, in one afternoon, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0314_3:0.6500:had lost the fruits of eight months of sincere and care
geniuspotter00pottiala_0314_4:0.5500:ful labor. In his heart he knew that it was at last too
geniuspotter00pottiala_0315_6:0.5000:unfreed? Yes, for the senses were stirring even now.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0318_1:0.8000:him: his first faint vision of the master-work to be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0318_2:0.7000:known to the music -loving world as the Tosca Sym
geniuspotter00pottiala_0318_3:0.6500:phony.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0318_4:0.5000:Autumn, and the first fortnight of December, proved

geniuspotter00pottiala_0318_36:0.6000:window, puffing at his pipe and absently staring into the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_1:0.5500:the lonely figure and placing a friendly hand upon his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_3:0.5500:There was a slight start. With an effort, the head
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_13:0.5500:In an instant, Ivan had lifted the canvas from the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_14:0.7500:frozen snow, and was helping the unhappy man to rise.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_15:0.6000:When he spoke, his voice had the tenderness of a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_16:0.6500:woman's:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_17:0.7500:"My friend, you have been unfortunate! I am a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_18:0.7500:worker myself, and have needed help in my time. Come
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_19:0.7000:to my rooms with me. I am all alone; and you must
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_20:0.7000:have rest and food."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_21:0.7000:"Food!" There was a note of elemental savagery in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_23:0.8000:Give me food! My gloves only got me half a loaf the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_24:0.5500:day before yesterday or three days ago it was,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_25:0.6000:I think."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_26:0.7000:" Are you strong enough, yet ? Are you sure you can ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_27:0.7000:-You see, you've been through a fearful ordeal."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_28:0.6000:Ivan spoke rather anxiously as, two hours later, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_29:0.7000:bent over the young man, now lying on the divan in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_30:0.7000:Ivan's living-room and looking even whiter and wearier
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_31:0.6000:than before he had eaten the meal just finished.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_32:0.7500:But the stranger smiled; and at sight of that smile
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_33:0.7500:Ivan felt a thrill of surprise. The eyes and features
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_34:0.7500:lighted up till the gaunt signs of want were forgotten
geniuspotter00pottiala_0320_35:0.6500:and the face looked like that of some cherubic boy. It
geniuspotter00pottiala_0324_1:0.5000:had accomplished. I stood with my back to him, sick
geniuspotter00pottiala_0324_6:0.5000:portrait of my sister had not the qualities of the Velas
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_2:0.5500:suddenly up, excited by this remembrance of by-gone
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_3:0.6000:misery, forgetting the sudden exhaustion so recently
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_4:0.6000:relieved. Two spots of red flamed in his cheeks; and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_5:0.5000:his blue eyes began to shine, feverishly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_6:0.5000:"Who are those that succeed? Only the ones that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_7:0.5000:have shelter for their heads, clothes to keep them warm,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_28:0.6000:presently unclosed his eyes, murmuring:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_29:0.6000:"I must go on, my friend. It is not long now. Will
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_30:0.7000:you hear me?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_31:0.8000:And Ivan, who had become a little restless with his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_32:0.8500:desire to get to work, answered, after an instant's hesi
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_33:0.7000:tation, in the affirmative.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_34:0.7500:"It took me a month to find a place where I dared
geniuspotter00pottiala_0326_35:0.8000:stay ; and it's taken two years to find out just how horri
geniuspotter00pottiala_0327_27:0.5000:"The police."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0327_28:0.8000:"A ah! And his brother F6odor ?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_13:0.6000:outpouring of his long and unsuccessful battle, Joseph
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_14:0.6000:sank back on his pillows, weak and shaken, but evident
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_15:0.5000:ly at the end of his confession.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_16:0.6000:Ivan was deeply moved; and in more ways than one.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_27:0.5000:and the increasing echoes of troika bells without, an
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_28:0.5000:nounced the advance of the fashionable driving-hour,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_30:0.5500:that presently mingled its soft radiance with the last
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_31:0.5500:glimmer of the dead day. Then, when the old servitor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_32:0.6000:had shuffled out, Ivan rose, cigarette in hand, and, gazing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_34:0.6000:"My brother, Russia has used you hardly. You
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_35:0.7000:must, therefore, let me, not only a Russian, but also a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0328_36:0.7500:fellow -workman, a lover of art, try to make amends for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0330_2:0.5500:the very existence of which was unsuspected by any other
geniuspotter00pottiala_0330_3:0.5500:man: for the treasure it contained was the gathered

geniuspotter00pottiala_0336_33:0.5500:the only ones bearable to remember!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0336_34:0.5000:His wife, a woman for whom he had had a certain
geniuspotter00pottiala_0336_35:0.8500:tolerant affection, but no respect, he had probably not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0336_36:0.7000:greatly mourned. Of friendship with his equals, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_1:0.6500:the musician stood a living reproach to the father
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_3:0.6000:than that of trickery, dishonesty, blackmail, all-un-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_4:0.6500:scrupulousness ; while the boy, by personal sacrifice and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_22:0.5000:ing incredibly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_24:0.5000:onciliation between the two might be recounted; but
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_25:0.7000:none brought result; and, in fact, till the very end, a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0338_27:0.6000:In the January of 1872, Michael Gregoriev entered upon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0340_35:0.5000:filled you see ; and his weakness is too great to repress the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0340_36:0.7000:sound. However, we must not expect "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0342_2:0.6000:chair for him, whispering, adroitly, that strychnine had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0342_3:0.6000:been given, that in a few minutes Prince Gregoriev
geniuspotter00pottiala_0342_5:0.5500:would remain in the antechamber awaiting his sum
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_2:0.5000:the fire, smoking, lost in vague conjectures. It was as
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_3:0.7000:well that he had not gone to bed. Precisely at mid
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_4:0.7500:night the ghostly hour the older doctor came quietly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_5:0.7500:in to him.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_6:0.9000:"Your Excellency, I regret to inform you that your
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_7:0.5500:father, Prince Michael, passed from us five minutes ago."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_8:0.5000:At ten o'clock on the following morning Ivan, quiet,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_9:0.5000:, self -possessed, entirely himself again, came down to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_10:0.5500:small drawing-room for his morning tea. He knew that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_12:0.5000:people enough to execute his orders. But the only com
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_14:0.5500:young Prince was this:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_16:0.5000:single person. At that hour have the whole household
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_18:0.5000:of news could the excited valet of the dead Prince carry
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_20:0.5000:to send every servant, male and female, scudding across
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_23:0.5500:Ivan, meantime, was occupying himself with the one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_31:0.6500:down on him in loving approval.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_32:0.6000:At half-past ten he stood alone in that sanctum which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_33:0.5000:was to know its grim master no more. Behind him was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_34:0.8000:a locked door; before him, the huge map, now entirely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0344_35:0.7000:covered with the minute black figures that constituted
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_1:0.5000:ollection of infinite work to be begun, precipitated that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_2:0.5000:subject to which his Highness was troublously leading up.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_3:0.5000:"The graciousness of your Imperial Highness does
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_4:0.5000:my father much honor. At the same time, realizing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_5:0.5000:the value of your time, it emboldens me to refer to a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_7:0.6000:beginning the adjustment of my father's private papers,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_30:0.5000:"Your Imperial Highness will pardon me if I request
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_31:0.6500:permission to answer you in deeds rather than words?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_32:0.6000:Will you do me the honor to come with me?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_33:0.7500:The Governor - General sprang to his feet. Ivan,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_34:0.6500:without speaking, led the way back to dead Michael's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_35:0.6500:inner room, into which the Grand-Duke preceded him,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0348_36:0.8000:his eyes falling at once upon the litter on the floor.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0350_1:0.5000:ever lower and lower towards the soil. He left Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0350_6:0.5500:great honors of Russia: the white-and-gold cross of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_1:0.5000:Laroche openly mourned. Ugly - faced, big - hearted
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_2:0.7000:Balakirev shook his convict head melancholy-wise.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_3:0.5500:Even Nicholas and Kashkine could only hope, half
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_4:0.7500:heartedly, that, despite his wealth, Ivan would stick
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_5:0.5500:to his work out of the inward necessity: the divine
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_6:0.5500:driving of the great artist.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0352_7:0.5500:Autumn justified the faithful. From the leisure of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_1:0.6500:mon to the low-class Russian. The background was a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_11:0.5000:among groups of flatterers, his ethereal face, framed in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_12:0.6000:its pale-gold hair, betraying very little of the elation
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_13:0.5500:that was tingling through him, as he listened to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_14:0.5500:comments on his work made by these men who " under
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_15:0.6500:stood." Still, of all the extravagant words, not one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_16:0.6500:meant to him so much as Ivan's strong hand-clasp and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_17:0.8500:his smiling:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_18:0.8500:"It is worth the thousand-mile walk; yes, and the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_19:0.8500:starvation too, Joseph, isn't it?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0354_20:0.6500:And Joseph bowed his head, in momentary, deep
geniuspotter00pottiala_0356_35:0.5000:was most congenial to him, he had gradually come to lay
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_1:0.5500:complete selfishness ; experienced heartlessness. To her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_2:0.5000:own detriment, Bohemia and penury could attract her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_4:0.5000:Contrast, indeed, constituted the one law of her law
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_5:0.5000:lessness. Without this, how had it been possible for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_6:0.6500:that first contact with the young painter to have filled
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_7:0.5000:her, instantaneously, with the variable flame that had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_8:0.6500:so often been her undoing ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_9:0.6000:Mademoiselle Petrovna, a young person fairly no
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_10:0.5500:torious, by this time, among the half-world of three or
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_34:0.5000:amining the various sketches and studies scattered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_35:0.7500:over the walls. Joseph managed to keep his head suf
geniuspotter00pottiala_0358_36:0.6500:ficiently to go through the necessary preliminaries
geniuspotter00pottiala_0359_3:0.5000:session could possibly accrue through this shy and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0359_4:0.6500:boyish young artist, so plainly in the throes of poverty,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0359_5:0.6500:was much relieved when the matter of size and price
geniuspotter00pottiala_0359_6:0.6000:had been settled and he could take his departure,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0359_36:0.5000:one word. In the beginning, their sensations were
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_1:0.6500:crudely formulative. But they rose, by degrees, till, at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_2:0.6500:the end, each was beset by a force so powerful that action
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_3:0.8500:had become an impossibility. Their farewell ran thus:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_4:0.8500:"When do you wish me again, Monsieur?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_5:0.7500:"When you can come, Madame."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_6:0.9000:"In two days?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_7:0.8500:"Yes; in two days."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_8:0.5500:" Alors au revoir !"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_9:0.7500:"Au revoir, Madame."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_10:0.8000:Thus they entered upon the eight -and -forty hours that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_11:0.5500:were to prepare the storm of the next meeting which
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_27:0.5000:through his storm -ridden brain:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_29:0.5000:Now, too, I am a man. Irina! Irina!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_30:0.8000:And, alas! Joseph fully believed himself! He never
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_31:0.7500:knew that, had he been in truth an artist now, those last
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_34:0.5000:perience in life, from highest joy to highest sorrow, that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_35:0.6500:is not transmuted, in the crucible of the artist's brain, into
geniuspotter00pottiala_0360_36:0.5500:some new form of knowledge to be used in his labor.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_28:0.7500:ly, without warning, his door was flung wide. The well-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_29:0.5500:known, silken swish of skirts, a breath of the familiar
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_31:0.6500:an Irina unfamiliar had entered, shut and bolted the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_32:0.6500:door behind her, stared at him for a moment, and then
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_33:0.7500:began to weep, hysterically.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_34:0.8000:"You! But Irina I you. But there is no light
geniuspotter00pottiala_0362_35:0.6500:for the pose now!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0364_1:0.6000:perfume was strong ; when conscience took a step too far.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0364_2:0.5500:One instant and he turned, clasping her in his arms:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0364_3:0.5000:"So let it be, beloved! Thou hast come to me: be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0364_10:0.6000:And the woman, with a half -sob, yielded herself to the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0364_11:0.5500:strong, young arms, nor wasted a thought upon that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_1:0.5500:sounds that followed and drove them, day by day,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_2:0.6000:night by night, on towards that low-lying land where
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_3:0.7000:dwell the throngs that are gathered together in the outer
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_4:0.5000:darkness that is so much denser than the tomb.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_5:0.6000:Lights! Green tables, gold-bespattered! The dron
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_6:0.6000:ing undertone of croupiers; the continual, languid in-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_7:0.6000:rake and out -rake of golden piles, of crackling notes,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0366_10:0.7000:much - remarked woman, the pale-faced, angel -eyed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_28:0.7000:clacked the brass knocker of the door.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_29:0.7000:A moment. Then came the sound of a woman's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_30:0.8000:voice, muffled, but startlingly familiar:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_31:0.9500:"C'est toi, Joseph?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_32:0.6500:Instantly, all the blood in Ivan's body rushed to his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_33:0.7000:brain. Then, fiercely seizing the door, he thrust it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_34:0.5000:open, strode into the studio, and found himself face to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_35:0.5500:face with Irina Petrovna.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0368_36:0.5000:Irina was garbed very much en negligee, but Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_1:0.9000:weak man against that man's weakness. How was he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_2:0.7500:to cope with a woman: and, above all, such a woman
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_3:0.8000:as this ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_4:0.8000:As the question passed through his mind, Irina her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_16:0.7000:his repentance and recovery.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_18:0.5500:this place. I tell you no. / am leaving it. // To
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_20:0.5500:he shall find himself once more unencumbered. Well,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_21:0.7000:I have allowed myself the luxury of explanation with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_22:0.5500:you. But now I must finish that, and go."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_23:0.6000:"And where do you go, Irina Petrovna?" inquired
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_24:0.9000:Ivan, in the deep, calm voice that suddenly bereft the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_25:0.8500:woman of all her easy impertinence.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_26:0.7500:Unquestionably, she flushed. "Do not ask me.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_27:0.7500:There is a refuge that is mine for the asking "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_28:0.7500:"Ah! Well, about Joseph. I have been listening to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_29:0.7000:his story as told by a man my friend. But I wish
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_30:0.7000:also to hear it from you, who know it all. How was it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_31:0.6500:that you met ? And what has become of his real work :
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_32:0.7500:of his talent?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_33:0.8000:Irina did not immediately reply. Picking a small,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_34:0.5000:gold case from a heap of baubles at her side, she drew
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_35:0.8500:therefrom a cigarette, lighted it, with that innate co
geniuspotter00pottiala_0370_36:0.6500:quetry that was her bane, and believed that Ivan did
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_1:0.7500:and future, trying to reconstruct the broken life of that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_2:0.5500:starving boy whom he once had fed.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_3:0.8500:The trunk was packed, and locked. Ivan did not
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_4:0.7000:look up. Not, indeed, until a tall woman, in a severely-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_6:0.5500:chamber bearing with her a lighted lamp, did he come
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_7:0.5500:back to himself, and offer to help her into the fur coat
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_8:0.7000:,that hung over one arm.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_9:0.9500:This act of courtesy accomplished, Ivan mechanically
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_10:0.9000:held out his hand. "You are leaving now?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_11:0.9500:"Yes."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_12:0.7500:"I shall wait here for him. Do you know when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_13:0.9000:he will come?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_14:0.9000:" By seven, probably. We usually dine at that hour."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_15:0.7500:"Thank you. Good-bye."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_16:0.7000:"Ivan!" The word was a strange whisper. Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_17:0.8000:started. When his eyes met hers, she was looking at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_18:0.7500:him almost steadily. The next instant she had uttered
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_20:0.5500:He returned to his seat, wondering a little about her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_29:0.6000:should she hesitate this time ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_30:0.5500:Heart-sick, Ivan returned to his seat in the lamp
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_31:0.5500:light. Odd that he should have come hither on this
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_32:0.5000:day of crisis! Was it well, or ill, that this was so?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_33:0.6500:Would Joseph, overwhelmed by his loss, prove pliable?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_34:0.8000:Would his weakness be guided by another's reason ?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_35:0.8500:Who could tell? If strength is always consistent,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0372_36:0.6000:weakness should be as often incalculable.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_1:0.8500:"Eat!" The upturned face, with its varnished eyes,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_2:0.7000:gleamed ghostlike in the yellow light. "This morning
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_3:0.8000:I"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_4:0.9000:"You've been at the 'Masque' all day?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_5:0.7000:"Oh, you see, I you know she needs a great deal.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_6:0.6500:Sometimes I I have hardly enough. Perhaps, now,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_7:0.7000:Ivan Mikhailovitch, you would lend "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_9:0.5500:harshly.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_10:0.7000:To his surprise, Joseph suddenly sprang to his feet,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_11:0.8500:crying, angrily: "See here, what the devil are you doing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_12:0.7500:here? And where is Irina? I want her! She knows
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_13:0.8500:me. Where has she gone?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_14:0.8500:"I don't know."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_15:0.7500:"Don't Rot! She's at a restaurant. I'm late.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_16:0.8500:Well, I'll wait." He stumbled backward into the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_17:0.7500:chair, again; but Ivan stood close before him, his face
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_18:0.7500:now as white as Joseph's own.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_19:0.6500:"Irina is not at a restaurant. She left these rooms
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_20:0.9000:early this afternoon, and took her things with her."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_21:0.7000:And, as he spoke, Ivan stiffened his every muscle, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_22:0.6500:instinctively clinched his hands.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_23:0.8000:For the moment, Joseph stared, stupidly. Then, all
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_24:0.7500:at once, he was up and at Ivan, lurching forward upon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_25:0.6500:him, clutching, impotently, at his throat, breathing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_26:0.7000:gutturally, while he uttered inarticulate syllables in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_27:0.8000:tongue of a serf.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_28:0.7500:Ivan, even in his disgust at this revelation of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_29:0.6500:man's lowest self, his unquestionable bad blood, held
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_30:0.7000:him off, easily. In a moment or two, indeed, he had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_31:0.6500:the half -drunken, wholly exhausted creature back in his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_32:0.8500:chair, panting and helpless.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_33:0.7500:Even now, it seemed, Joseph could meet his eyes.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_34:0.5500:A long look passed between them, and Ivan perceived
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_35:0.9000:that the painter had come enough to himself to try to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0374_36:0.5500:analyze his position. He was, however, wholly unpre-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_1:0.6000:pared when the fellow sprang at him again, this time
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_2:0.8000:with a wild shriek:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_3:0.8500:"Ah! You devil! You devil! It was you, you who
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_4:0.7500:have taken her from me! My God! You I"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_5:0.7500:" Kashkarin, listen! Be silent. You can't hurt me.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_6:0.8500:Listen!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_7:0.8000:There was too much quiet mastery in that voice for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_8:0.6500:disobedience. Joseph became suddenly quiet.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_9:0.6500:"I came here this afternoon to see what was to be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_10:0.5500:done for you. When I arrived, Mademoiselle Patrovna
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_13:0.6000:you. She told me she should be cared for. There is
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_14:0.6500:some one else. I let her go, gladly, knowing it to be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_15:0.7000:well for you. And now "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_16:0.7500:The interruption this time was a burst of furious
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_17:0.5000:laughter, so loud, so fierce, that Ivan was appalled.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_18:0.7000:Joseph, it seemed, had become a demon. When at last
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_19:0.6500:he spoke, it was only to repeat some of Ivan's words:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_20:0.7000:"Aware she was ruining me! Was! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_21:0.5000:And you believed it "weir for me! 'Well!' Ah-ha-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_32:0.5500:old power of art "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_35:0.5000:clasp, he turned away from Ivan and stood for a moment
geniuspotter00pottiala_0375_36:0.5000:mute. When he again faced round, his face was all but
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_2:0.6000:this demoniac look grew more and more horrible, till
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_3:0.5500:Ivan felt himself overwhelmed: as much by Joseph's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_4:0.6000:appearance as by his words. For the moment, the man
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_5:0.6000:was beyond sanity. And from the depths of his bemired
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_6:0.5000:soul poured fragments of that understanding that still
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_22:0.5000:"Leave me, Ivan Gregoriev, to my own. You can
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_23:0.5500:never know me. I hate you now. Irina has gone
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_24:0.8000:away. Having brought me to this, I disgust her! Go
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_25:0.7500:thou, then, clean body, clean hands, clean heart!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_26:0.9000:Ach ! I hate hate hate !
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_27:0.8000:"And there sits my devil clothed in the scarlet.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_28:0.8500:Look on her! Look! Look, for the last time, before I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_29:0.8000:pay her her wage of destruction! So! There! And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_30:0.6000:there! And there!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_31:0.7500:It was the canvas containing his first portrait of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_32:0.6500:Irina. Seizing a palette-knife from a neighboring tray
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_33:0.7000:of brushes and paints, he stabbed thrice into the canvas,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_34:0.7500:ripping the picture, wickedly, from top to bottom,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_35:0.8500:from side to side.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0376_36:0.6000:"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! You see her? I damn her there
geniuspotter00pottiala_0378_25:0.5000:man-struggle, it seemed as if each trial, each disappoint
geniuspotter00pottiala_0378_26:0.6000:ment, had been built on a variation of a single theme.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0378_27:0.8500:Of the several friendships that had been his, all, after
geniuspotter00pottiala_0378_28:0.6000:running an uncertain course, had come to violent or
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_1:0.8000:bitual frown, and stole away without making appeal to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_2:0.8000:the heart -hungry man who now, year by year, labored
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_3:0.8000:alone in his desolate palace.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_5:0.5000:bringing rich harvest of Ivan's great gift to the music-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_7:0.5500:wherefore he, deeply resentful, held every individual of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_11:0.5000:On Wednesday October isth, in the last-named year,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_12:0.5500:Ivan, book in hand, sat idling over his dejeuner, when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_14:0.6500:to announce that a great lady waited in the drawing-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_15:0.6000:room and would not be denied a sight of His Excellency.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_16:0.7000:So, three minutes later, Ivan found himself face to face
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_17:0.7000:with the secret lady of his heart.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_18:0.8500:" Nathalie! Princess!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_19:0.9000:"'Nathalie,' please, dear cousin. Ivan, I am in great
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_20:0.9500:trouble, and I have come to you for help."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_21:0.9000:"Help! Trouble!" Ivan's low voice faltered. "Ah!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_22:0.9000:Can I make it right for you?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_23:0.9500:The woman before him shook her head, sadly. "No
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_24:0.6500:one can ever make it right, Ivan."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_25:0.7500:"What is it, Nathalie?" In his secret mind, he was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_26:0.8000:just murmuring her name, over and over again, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_27:0.6000:blessing the woe that had brought her to him.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_28:0.6500:"For the present I am here, in Moscow; and my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_29:0.7500:children are with me. I might have sent for you sooner,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_30:0.6500:by note, Ivan. I ought, I suppose. But I waited too
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_31:0.7500:long, and so came myself!" And she looked at him,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_32:0.8500:her lips smiling, her troubled eyes full of anxiety.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_33:0.6000:Even after all the years, Ivan read her well enough
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_34:0.7000:not to answer that smile. Instead, he led her, scarcely
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_35:0.8000:protesting, into the dining-room ; despatched the amazed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0380_36:0.5500:but delighted Piotr for fresh tea and something to eat ;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0381_35:0.5500:mother's death, I never wholly realized the truth of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0382_14:0.5000:As she paused, Ivan leaned forward and impetuously
geniuspotter00pottiala_0382_26:0.5000:Towards the end, his tone had become slightly un
geniuspotter00pottiala_0384_35:0.5000:still more amazing fact that he was now beginning to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0384_36:0.5500:be recognized as an incalculable power in the world of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0386_1:0.5500:ing upon one of her husband's frequent absences, she
geniuspotter00pottiala_0386_2:0.5500:completely dissolved her establishment, told the furi
geniuspotter00pottiala_0386_3:0.7500:ous, vile-tongued Frenchwoman quite calmly that her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0386_4:0.7000:services were no longer necessary; and, that evening,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0386_5:0.7000:with her children, two servants, and her personal effects,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0388_33:0.6500:of stairs which led to the lady of his desire.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0388_35:0.8500:hour when Prince Gregoriev knocked upon his cousin's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0388_36:0.5000:door; and the tenth vibration had not yet died upon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_1:0.6000:however, she was unprepared for his first action, which,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_2:0.7500:as it were, threw a search-light upon the sole idea into
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_3:0.7500:which the confusion eventually resolved itself.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_4:0.5500:Ceasing his walk he went swiftly to her, took her two
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_5:0.6500:hands, drew them protectively to his breast, and said,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_6:0.9000:huskily: "You are in great trouble, Nathalie. You are
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_7:0.7000:unhappy. Is it tell me! is it grief for him?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_8:0.7500:Before the clearness of his look, her own went down.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_9:0.8000:A faint color crept into her cheeks. For one moment
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_10:0.6500:she hesitated; but finally rose to his own height of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_27:0.6000:"Nathalie!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_28:0.7000:The Princess started at the note of agony in Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_29:0.9000:voice.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_30:0.6500:"Nathalie! You are not to suffer for that brute:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_31:0.5500:that brute who drove you here drove you to me!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_33:0.5000:to make him relinquish, he suddenly sank upon one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0390_35:0.5500:with her own. Then, oblivious of all things else, he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_2:0.5500:Yet she was enough affected by the death of the man who
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_3:0.5000:had done her every despite, but who had, nevertheless,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_4:0.6500:taught her the mystery of life and given her her children,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_5:0.6000:to be distressed at this proposal in the first hours of her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_6:0.8500:widowhood.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_7:0.7500:Gently she put Ivan from her, and rose, moving
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_8:0.7500:towards the window, before which she stood, gazing
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_9:0.8000:down into the white street, while Ivan waited, trembling
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_10:0.7500:with emotion. When she turned to him again, she had
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_11:0.5500:replaced the chains upon her feelings.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_12:0.5000:"This afternoon I am leaving for Petersburg," she
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_13:0.5000:said. "I must carry your words away with me. My
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_23:0.6000:can help. This is fair, I think.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_24:0.5500:"And now, I can give you no more time to-day.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_25:0.5000:No, you can do nothing, thank you. Le'onie for me,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_26:0.7500:old Ka"sha for the children they do everything. We
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_27:0.8000:leave the Petersburg station at five. Come then, if you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_28:0.8000:will, to say good-bye to the little girls. Our au revoir
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_29:0.7000:must be here."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_30:0.8000:"Au revoir!" echoed Ivan, his voice gleaming.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_31:0.6500:Madame Fe"odoreff smiled, rather sadly. "Ah, Ivan,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_32:0.5000:whatever my answer to you, tell me that I shall have
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_33:0.5500:your friendship still! It is the most precious thing that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_34:0.6000:is left me, excepting my children. I cannot afford to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_35:0.8000:lose you as my friend. Promise!" and she held out her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0392_36:0.5000:hand.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0393_1:0.8500:He took it, quietly. " I promise, dear lady of my life."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0393_2:0.7500:"Then, again au revoir!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0394_10:0.5000:'Alexis can never be wiped away.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0394_20:0.5000:into this letter and have clung to it, willy-nilly. Ivan
geniuspotter00pottiala_0394_21:0.7000:was not of these. Self-deception was never a vice of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0394_22:0.5500:his; and, from this hour, the soul of Nathalie Fe'odoreff
geniuspotter00pottiala_0396_32:0.6500:symptom of chronic melancholy, he refused every sug
geniuspotter00pottiala_0396_33:0.6500:gestion, and left his servants to return to their quarters,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0396_34:0.7000:dismally shaking their gray heads over his mental state.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0396_35:0.8500:So through the winter. But the flowing of spring
geniuspotter00pottiala_0396_36:0.7000:tide rouses the dullest to contemplate some possible
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_7:0.6000:scended from his imaginary rostrum, as eager as his fel
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_9:0.5500:r
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_10:0.5000:It is no very rare thing for the Russian May-day to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_29:0.5500:tive gardens.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_31:0.5000:tremulous with emotion; and, as his vehicle left the vil
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_33:0.5000:side, reading, as in a familiar book, each old, beloved
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_34:0.7000:character printed on the open page of the landscape seen
geniuspotter00pottiala_0398_35:0.7000:last during the summer he had spent here alone, after
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_1:0.5500:dwell here with her beside him, in his heart, always!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_2:0.5000:But certainly this room, save for the tambour and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_30:0.5500:wife had prayed God for the boon of motherhood.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_31:0.6500:The very shrine before which Sophia had knelt,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_32:0.6000:bracket, ikon, and brass candlestick, still hung on the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_33:0.6000:far wall, beside the bed. Ivan's eyes paused at it, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_34:0.5000:he was seized by the impulse to speak to his mother
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_35:0.8000:from that spot. Repressing himself, however, he sat
geniuspotter00pottiala_0400_36:0.6000:down beside a table on which he leaned an elbow, sup-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0401_31:0.6000:" Waited! I commanded tea in an hour. It can't
geniuspotter00pottiala_0401_32:0.5000:be five."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0401_35:0.5000:suddenly, he swayed, caught himself, by means of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0401_36:0.5000:table, and sank back in his chair with a suppressed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0402_1:0.6500:groan. The old servitor ran forward, fear in his face;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0402_2:0.6500:but Ivan, smiling at him, waved him away:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0402_3:0.5500:"It is quite well with me, S6sha. Go bring the sam
geniuspotter00pottiala_0404_1:0.6000:library, considerable reading, especially at meal-times,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0404_2:0.6000:of Russian, French and English novelists and the Ger

geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_30:0.6500:there.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_31:0.5500:At the same time, the "Prince" Gregoriev, together
geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_32:0.6000:with a piece of gold, did serve to cut many yards from
geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_33:0.6000:the red tape that impedes all progress in Russia. A
geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_34:0.7000:brief explanation, two minutes' wait, the appearance
geniuspotter00pottiala_0408_35:0.6500:of a young man garbed in spotless white, a walk up
geniuspotter00pottiala_0409_11:0.5000:left a considerable sum for him."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0409_20:0.5000:"What?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0409_31:0.7000:" The man is dying, Prince Gregoriev. Only a miracle
geniuspotter00pottiala_0409_35:0.5000:The room was small, rather bare, but clean and well-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_1:0.7500:half of it extending into the room beyond. A second
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_3:0.5000:held medicines and the night-lamp. This man rose as
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_5:0.5500:was spoken between them. Ivan caught the phrase:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_24:0.5000:to Ivan, saying, nonchalantly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_26:0.5500:minutes, if you wish to speak to him. But he's failing.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_27:0.5500:He'll hardly linger to see the sun."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_28:0.6000:In spite of himself Ivan betrayed something of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0410_35:0.6000:racked his emaciated frame as if it would tear flesh
geniuspotter00pottiala_0411_27:0.6000:"Ah, now I know I am dying. You cannot despise a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_30:0.6000:enough, rich enough, do you think? And are the lips
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_31:0.8000:too much a ' thread of scarlet ' ? Oh the opalline lights
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_32:0.9000:in that cloud! How to blend such colors on a palette?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_33:0.6500:Nature? She is mocking, too.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_34:0.6500:" But oh, Irina, I see it now, at last! The dawn the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_35:0.8500:dawn is here. The night is gone. I have dreamed, I
geniuspotter00pottiala_0412_36:0.5000:suppose: ugly dreams. But they, too, are done with.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0413_1:0.5500:Look, my beloved, it is morning! The first sunbeam
geniuspotter00pottiala_0413_3:0.6000:lifting his thin body, arms wide-stretched, eyes a-glitter,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0413_6:0.5000:faint, far cry of satisfaction, had it, and was gone.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_1:0.5000:self, bitterly, that Prince Gregoriev was worth an at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_2:0.5000:tempt which would not have been wasted on Ivan the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_3:0.6500:composer
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_4:0.6500:It was noon on the fourteenth day of the month when
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_5:0.5000:Ivan re-entered the lonely house at Klin, whence he was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_31:0.5000:secret societies might shriek and rave of the necessary
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_33:0.6000:themselves had tired a little of the everlasting howls of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_34:0.6500:bomb-thrower and assassin ; and quieter years succeeded
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_35:0.8000:those of Russia's greatest shame.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0415_36:0.8500:Ivan, from his hermitage, took some part in the coro-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0416_2:0.6500:March, and the great "Victory" overture, played in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0416_34:0.5000:his talent; and when "Boris" left his hands perfected,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0416_35:0.8000:he completely lost interest in it, and began at once to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0416_36:0.5000:devote himself to his unnumbered symphony, the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_1:0.7500:skies of fiery blue. I bid good-bye to Russia. Time
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_2:0.8000:shall lead me whither it will!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_3:0.8000:Kashkine, gazing at him thoughtfully, felt a sudden
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_4:0.5000:chill of doubt creep into his heart. The time for his

geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_33:0.7000:When he had reached his final period, the silence was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_34:0.8000:awe-inspiring. Ave"lallement, his wife, even Grieg, who
geniuspotter00pottiala_0418_35:0.5000:was an enthusiastic admirer of Ivan's work, sat dumb
geniuspotter00pottiala_0420_2:0.7500:any conceit in his manner, it made him an object of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0420_3:0.5000:adulation that drove him into frequent fits of contrary
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_1:0.6000:here! All was smoothly, exquisitely polished: urbanely,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_3:0.5000:kine noted that Ivan was turning inward again towards
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_4:0.5500:himself and his habitual solitude. And he knew that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_6:0.6000:themselves on the spikes of a chestnut -burr of morose-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_7:0.6000:ness, brusquerie, and blunt refusals to have anything to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_22:0.5500:"Why?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_25:0.5500:gether in the salon of Ivan's suite, the Prince called
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_26:0.5000:Piotr to him, ordered him to arrange a farewell dinner
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_28:0.5500:to leave, on the succeeding morning, for Nice, where they

geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_31:0.8000:The events of the ensuing months contain no musical
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_32:0.7000:history of any note. Italy, still arrogant over her florid
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_33:0.6000:successes of the fifties, had nothing but ridicule for the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_35:0.8000:to simple melody, accompanied by the tum-ti-tum of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0422_36:0.5000:guitar-notes, that lightest dessert of the musical feast,

geniuspotter00pottiala_0424_27:0.5000:capital of Tuscany where he was to make his temporary
geniuspotter00pottiala_0424_29:0.5500:at hand to welcome him.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0424_30:0.6000:Probably no city in all the world possesses so powerful
geniuspotter00pottiala_0424_35:0.7000:ever, with the greatest friendliness; and among these
geniuspotter00pottiala_0424_36:0.5500:"Prince" Gregoriev was effusively received. It was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0426_11:0.7000:Signs of awakening were, however, plainly visible in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0427_17:0.5000:hospitality, and sat for half an hour over a samovar in a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0427_34:0.5000:mind was too full for further utterance.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_30:0.5500:of humankind.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_32:0.5500:where she remained in seclusion during the summer,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_33:0.6000:but in the autumn opened a salon which, in point of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_34:0.7000:brilliance, elegance, and distinction, eclipsed every other
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_35:0.7500:in the Tuscan capital.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0428_36:0.6500:The young Princess was a woman of remarkable

geniuspotter00pottiala_0430_34:0.5000:a kind of fellow-feeling, for this woman whose bravery
geniuspotter00pottiala_0430_35:0.7500:was of the greatest known to humanity. Even to-night
geniuspotter00pottiala_0431_1:0.5500:class; and he shuddered at their conscienceless incon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0431_2:0.5500:sistency. For the moment, probably, he forgot the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0431_3:0.5500:sage maxim concerning "safety in numbers." The
geniuspotter00pottiala_0431_4:0.5500:woman who yields herself to a single great passion and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0431_5:0.6000:will neither hide it nor cap it with another, is surely lost
geniuspotter00pottiala_0432_34:0.6000:asked.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0432_35:0.6000:Early in their friendship, as soon, indeed, as she per
geniuspotter00pottiala_0432_36:0.5000:ceived that he ranged himself absolutely with her, Ivan

geniuspotter00pottiala_0434_2:0.7000:rhetoric may be cultivated, the most wonderful of tac

geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_25:0.6000:saying that the Princess is believed to be dying. She "
geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_27:0.5500:"There was a hemorrhage early in the morning;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_28:0.6000:and"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_29:0.6000:"She has sent for me?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_34:0.5000:night.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0435_35:0.5000:Fifteen minutes later he was standing at the door of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_1:0.5000:was beating, tumultuously, and he knew that he was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_2:0.7500:afraid of the word that might greet him. Still every
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_3:0.7000:window visible from below had been ablaze. Surely it
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_5:0.6000:He knocked, quietly, at last; and, after a little wait,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_6:0.5000:was admitted to the antechamber by a person who was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_8:0.5000:seventeen years old, her head crowned by a coronal of
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_10:0.7000:with jet-black lashes, exact replicas of the Princess' own.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_11:0.6000:Meeting those eyes, Ivan gave a sudden, comprehensive
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_12:0.7000:start. Then he said, a little confusedly:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_13:0.7500:"My name is Gregoriev. I understand that the Prin
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_14:0.6500:cess Nikitenko sent for me some hours ago. I received
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_15:0.7500:the message only within the last half-hour. Can you
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_16:0.7000:tell me if she is easier?" '*
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_17:0.7000:The girl shook her head, slowly. She was very quiet,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_18:0.5500:but seemed dazed. "No. It is impossible that my
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_20:0.5500:and knew me, then. The priest is with her now; and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_21:0.5000:the Signor Dottore is waiting, in the sala. Please to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0436_22:0.5500:come in, Eccellenze. If she should be able, after re

geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_5:0.6500:hardly dare interrupt the priest, who came to her at
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_6:0.8000:her special request."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_7:0.9000:"Certainly not. My great regret is that, not dreaming
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_8:0.6500:the attack was serious, I left town for the day. I shall
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_33:0.5500:Was it beauty ? Was it not rather a kind of chic dia
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_34:0.5000:blerie, that is so much more attractive, so much more
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_35:0.7500:dangerous, than mere perfection of feature and pro
geniuspotter00pottiala_0437_36:0.7500:portion? Good Heavens! What a destiny, too, for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0438_12:0.5000:routine of the mechanical religion of her order?
geniuspotter00pottiala_0438_14:0.5000:young man's brain; but he did not note that Ivan's
geniuspotter00pottiala_0438_15:0.6500:gaze was fixed on Vittoria with the same expression ; that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0438_16:0.5000:his own thoughts were echoed in Gregoriev's mind. Ivan,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0438_17:0.5000:indeed, was undergoing rather a startling dream, or hal
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_10:0.6500:On the father's white face were traces of emotion. His
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_11:0.7500:right hand was uplifted, two of his fingers stretched out
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_12:0.7500:in benediction. As he spoke, his old voice trembled:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_13:0.8000:"Let us give thanks to God for His mercy. A sinful
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_14:0.9500:soul, repentant and shriven, has been gathered home."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_15:0.9500:Vittoria, with a low cry, fell upon her knees. Ivan,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_16:0.9000:gone deathly white, stepped forward.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0439_17:0.7000:"The Princess Nikitenko is dead?" he asked, dully.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0440_1:0.5000:dressed, middle-aged man who, hidden in the shadow
geniuspotter00pottiala_0440_11:0.6000:command.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0440_12:0.5000:" In two days, Piotr, we shall leave for Russia. Make
geniuspotter00pottiala_0440_13:0.5500:things ready; and come to me for the necessary money.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0441_27:0.5000:black, with a slight silvering only at the temples, his
geniuspotter00pottiala_0441_28:0.5500:hair and beard were now almost pure white. The lines
geniuspotter00pottiala_0442_35:0.8000:to meet their Prince, one face was missing. After
geniuspotter00pottiala_0442_36:0.6500:hasty greetings, Ivan, with a sudden sense of the truth,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0443_8:0.5000:made no rebuke ; for he knew that the humility of these
geniuspotter00pottiala_0443_34:0.6500:for the act was one newly characteristic of her:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0443_35:0.8000:"My dear Ivan, I am forty-four years old: a safe age,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0443_36:0.5000:if ever woman is to attain to one. I now, therefore,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0444_1:0.8500:insist upon the comfort of personal freedom. It is the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0446_2:0.5000:ered.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0446_3:0.5500:In the weeks dividing New Year's Day from the April
geniuspotter00pottiala_0446_4:0.6500:of 1890, Gregoriev seldom left his bed. He was attended
geniuspotter00pottiala_0446_6:0.5500:growing alarm, how slowly the strength seemed to come
geniuspotter00pottiala_0446_7:0.7000:back to him, and how little increase of vitality arrived
geniuspotter00pottiala_0448_1:0.5000:Opposite the altar-pedestal, stood the single piece of fur
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_1:0.5500:as the poles of the earth, and bearing no such similarity:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_2:0.6000:the history and surmised character of Nathalie's be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_3:0.6500:loved patroness, the Grand-Duchess Catharine, and
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_4:0.5500:those of the child of the wild romance of Alexandrine
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_6:0.6000:As to the mental atmosphere in which Ivan passed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0450_16:0.5000:Gregoriev was fifty years old; a man ordinarily nor
geniuspotter00pottiala_0452_1:0.5500:Ivan on his assured triumph. For, well as he knew
geniuspotter00pottiala_0452_2:0.5000:his friend's instability, Constantine never for an instant
geniuspotter00pottiala_0452_9:0.6000:satisfaction at the prospect of Ivan's delight. This

geniuspotter00pottiala_0452_25:0.7000:ball, muttered, between his teeth: "Ah! 'transforma

geniuspotter00pottiala_0454_33:0.7000:the Petersburg station and Ivan.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0454_34:0.6500:Thus was Ivan finally, and for all time, established
geniuspotter00pottiala_0456_1:0.6000:into those eyes which had striven so many times, of late,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0456_2:0.5000:to pierce the shadows that enshroud the future.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0456_3:0.8000:"Restthee, oh God!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0456_4:0.6000:Rest for him! How often had he demanded it, in
geniuspotter00pottiala_0456_5:0.6000:vain? Now, at last, he was enjoined to take it for
geniuspotter00pottiala_0458_1:0.6500:that rules the world ? Is our God a demon ? It is the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0458_2:0.5000:logical inference.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0458_14:0.6000:tube.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0458_35:0.5500:voice of one distant, but coming nearer. It was the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0458_36:0.6000:voice of Sophia, his mother.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_1:0.6000:His face was uplifted, and he smiled as he echoed her
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_2:0.6500:words:
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_3:0.8000:"Rest thee, Rest thee, thou God!"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_4:0.8500:With some difficulty he rose to his feet, and stumbled,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_5:0.5500:heavily, into the inner room, where Aphrodite gleamed
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_6:0.6000:through her incense cloud. Here, with the air of one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_7:0.7500:tired unto death, he sank down upon the leathern couch.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0459_8:0.6500:And so the heavy eyelids closed over his weary, weary
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_16:0.5000:doubted anxiety about her.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_17:0.5500:"Smile for me, mother! Welcome me home!" he
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_18:0.5000:cried; filled now with a deep, expanding joy, wholly
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_19:0.5000:new and wonderful.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_20:0.6000:Sophia, looking down upon him, smiled, indeed, but
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_27:0.5000:of brethren of the spirit : in life unknown ; in death be
geniuspotter00pottiala_0460_28:0.5500:loved. There was Mozart the beautiful; Beethoven,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_1:0.6000:of lion-mien; Schumann, Schubert, Wagner the tempest
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_2:0.5500:uous, and the melancholy Pole. But none of them ap
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_3:0.5000:proached him closely, yearn as he might for welcome
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_4:0.6500:from them, his familiars. Nor did Sophia's sweet seri
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_5:0.9000:ousness brighten.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_6:0.7500:"Mother, what is it?" he whispered. "Why are we
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_7:0.8000:waiting?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_8:0.8000:"For a decision, Ivan. You have come to us before
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_9:0.8000:your time."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_10:0.8000:"But not without reason," he answered, quietly, with
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_11:0.8000:a dignity that seemed to her adequate. "There is a
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_12:0.8500:question I have died to ask."
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_13:0.9000:"It shall be heard, then," said a voice: a voice inex
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_14:0.7500:plicable ; resonant ; divine.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_15:0.6500:Immediately Sophia and all the silent throng melted
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_17:0.5000:the couch, prostrated himself, instinctively, before the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_18:0.5000:figure that appeared, framed in the oaken doorway of the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_19:0.7000:outer room: the figure of a man white-robed, whose face,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_20:0.6500:luminous and gently strong, was turned to him in tran
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_21:0.7000:quil majesty.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_22:0.7000:"Ask thy question, O Mortal," repeated the Christ-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_23:0.7000:voice.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_24:0.6000:So Ivan, lifting his head, replied: "I came to ask it;
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_25:0.9000:being unable longer to reconcile myself to a life incon
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_26:0.6000:sistent with all logic.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_27:0.7500:"O King! Tell me how it is that a world, God-con
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_28:0.7000:ceived, therefore inevitably perfect, became corrupt,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_29:0.5000:filled with, and governed by, evil ? wherein great burdens
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_30:0.8000:are borne by the good; and wickedness, vice, injustice,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_31:0.6000:flourish unrebuked and unpunished. Whence comes this
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_32:0.7500:evil, and why?"
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_33:0.6500:The question was spoken bravely and unfalteringly,
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_34:0.7000:for Ivan could perceive no sign of displeasure in the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_35:0.7500:thoughtful countenance of the Man Divine. There was
geniuspotter00pottiala_0461_36:0.7000:an impressive pause ; and Ivan had his answer.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0462_32:0.5500:The trembling question halted; for, heeding his voice
geniuspotter00pottiala_0462_33:0.7500:no longer, the Divine Figure passed beyond sight. And
geniuspotter00pottiala_0462_34:0.6500:presently Ivan, lost in new meditation, perceived that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0462_35:0.5500:he was floating softly upward, through space. About
geniuspotter00pottiala_0462_36:0.5500:him, close as in his long-past babyhood, were clasped
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_1:0.6000:his mother's arms; which drew him at last into that
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_2:0.5500:peace that passeth understanding.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_3:0.5000:It was nine o'clock when the little household of Mai-
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_9:0.5000:speedily solved. Coming out of the room, she bade the
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_11:0.7500:treat of her ogre.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_12:0.7000:Five minutes later she ceased to bruise her knuckles
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_13:0.8000:upon that locked, unyielding door. What in the world
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_14:0.6500:was Ivan about ? Never, truly, had man slept through
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_15:0.8500:such noise as this! And Ivan's sleep was notably light!
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_16:0.8500:With a chill of premonition, she ran down the hall to
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_17:0.5500:call the men.
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_18:0.7500:When at last Piotr, young Ivan, and Makdr, working
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_21:0.6000:over which Ivan reigned no longer. She was the first
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_23:0.6000:and by something more. It was also she the one
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_24:0.8500:great love of his loveless life who closed, at last, those
geniuspotter00pottiala_0463_25:0.6000:staring, questioning eyes.
