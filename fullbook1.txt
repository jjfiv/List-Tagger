Census Office, Washington, Sept. 1, 1854. 

To the Hon. K. McClelland, 

Secretary of the Interior. 

In the volume which is now handed you — though restricted in size 
by the order of Congress — will be found a very full compendium of 
the Census Statistics of the United States from the earliest period, 
together with all of the tables embraced in the quarto publication of 
1850, with the few exceptions noted below. To these have been added 
a large amount of information collected for the first time from the 
returns and from other official sources, with illustrative notes and 
ratio and comparative tables. 

In lieu of the classification of ages by counties and their subdivis- 
ions, the births, marriages and deaths, the church and school statistics 
by counties, and the occupations by States, I have inserted as of 
wider interest, county tables in the following particulars — of popu- 
lation, white, free colored and slave, native and foreign, male and fe- 
male, in 1850, with the aggregate in 1840, and the changes of county 
organization within that time; of college, private school and public 
school scholars, with the revenues appropriated to each; the' total 
educational income; the illiterate; the number of persons within the 
school age, and the actual average of scholars in the year; of the 
number of farms; and the capital, product and amount of labor in 
manufactures, mining and the mechanic arts. The occupations and 
the number of births, marriages and deaths are given in States and 
in great sections of the Union, and the specific ages and nativities in 
all the leading cities. 

The tables embraced in the volume have been examined and revised, 
involving in most cases a re-examination of 'the returns, during which 
care was taken to exhaust, by way of illustration, for certain cities, 
counties, or States, every source of information embodied in them. 
This would have been done for the whole Union had time and the 
means at my disposition admitted. As it was, however, the time and 
labor actually expended will, I trust, be amply repaid in the results. 
Never before has so large a part of the census material, collected by 
such expensive machinery, been made available by the government, 
for popular use, in compact and systematic form. 

The statistics of manufactures and of mortality, which alone remain 
of the census, will be ready for publication by the meeting of Congress, 
and can be included if desired in a volume of the size of the present. 

For other suggestions in relation to the experiences of this office 
and the history of the census system of the United States, I beg to 
refer you in particular to the Introductory Chapter. 

Your obedient servant, 

J. D. B. DeBOW.

In every country, and almost at all periods, the exigencies of revenue or of 
military service must have rendered occasionally necessary some sort of estimation 
of the numbers of the people. Among the Greeks and Romans inquiries in re- 
gard to population were often pressed to a considerable extent, yet the science of 
statistics, as now understood, may be said to belong altogether to the present age. 
Achenwall, of Prussia, who lived about the middle of the last century, has the 
credit of having given form and name to this important branch of knowledge, and 
is said to have left the full development of its principles to be carried out by his 
pupil, Schlozer. Other writers followed each other in rapid succession, until Sir 
John Sinclair at last introduced the term into Britain, and the Society of Univer- 
sal Statistics was founded in 1829, in France. The transactions of this Society, 
arranged under the several divisions, give a better idea of the scope of the science 
of statistics than could be otherwise expressed. They include — 

1st. Physical and Descriptive Statistics — embracing topography, hydrography, meteorology, 
population, man physically, hygiene, and the sanitary state. 2d. Positive and Applied Statis- 
tics — embracing animal and vegetable productions, agriculture, industry, commerce, naviga- 
tion, state of the science, general institutions, literature, language and the fine arts. 3d. Moral 
and Philosophical Statistics — including the forms of religious worship, legislative and judicial 
powers, public administration, finance, the marine, military and diplomacy. 

The importance of correct information regarding the age, sex, condition, occu- 
pation and numbers of a people, their moral and social state, their education and 
industry, is now universally recognized among the enlightened of all civilized 
nations. Where this information can be had for periods running back very far, 
and for many countries, it furnishes the material for contrasts and compari- 
sons the most instructive, and for deducing the soundest rules in the administra- 
tion of Government, or in promoting the general welfare of society. 

Statistics are far from being the barren array of figures ingeniously and 
laboriously combined into columns and tables, which many persons are apt to sup- 
pose them. They constitute rather the ledger of a nation, in which, like the mer- 
chant in his books, the citizen can read, at one view, all of the results of a year 
or of a period of years, as compared with other periods, and deduce the profit or 
the loss which has been made, in morals, education, wealth or power.

10 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

Are the results objected to upon the score of being imperfect, or in some re- 
spects unreliable ? Let the objection be admitted, and is it necessary to grope in 
absolute darkness because Lt is impossible to have absolute truth ? If the census 
of a people, for example, cannot be received implicitly, does it become proper and 
right to have no data whatever ? Are men acting upon this principle in other 
matters? Is not a large and valuable mass of human knowledge derived entirely 
from approximations? If there cannot be faith in the results of a census, can 
there be in those of imports and of exports, returned at the custom-houses, or by 
the registries of the several ports, or in the returns of the popular elections? With- 
out doubt the degree of accuracy of a census may be very great or very small — 
dependent upon the pains which has been bestowed, the qualifications of the parties 
employed in taking, or afterwards combining it, and the intelligence of the masses 
of the people. The chances of error are countless at almost every step. In Eu- 
rope, where the system is thought to be comparatively perfect, and where the best 
talent is always employed, the chances of error will be as great, perhaps from the 
want of general intelligence in the people and in their fear of taxation, as in the 
United States, where the people are generally informed, but the census system is 
bad, and the enumerators are worse. Hence there is little practical difference in 
the results in either case. Moreover, the imperfections of the census are believed 
to be exaggerated. All intention to deceive must of course be excluded, and a 
faithless performance of duties can be easily detected by the exposure to the pub- 
lic view, of the returns in the several neighborhoods where they are made, which 
is invariably required. There is, besides, an equal chance that errors will com- 
pensate or balance each other, and those that remain will not greatly impair the 
result. Admitting the latter to be the ease, and that it is a question, what pro- 
portion the children of a State, under one year of age, bear to the whole popu- 
lation of that State? Let the population be 1,000,000, and the children 25,000, 
or two and a half per cent. If the marshal has entered 500 of these children 
erroneously — which would be a great amount of error certainly — the ratio will 
only be affected to the extent of the one twentieth of one per cent. ; a very trifling 
fraction. However deficient the census system of the United States has been, any 
one who will take the trouble to compare the results upon certain points, will per- 
ceive how strikingly and truly the several enumerations harmonize — a confirma- 
tion, at least, of their general accuracy, whatever the particular errors which may 
be pointed out.* 

An enlightened people wiM not object to the apparent exposure of their affairs, 
involved in a census, (that exposure, after all, amounting to very little, since the 
Government is pledged against the use of the material, except in the aggregate, 
and merging all individuality,) when satisfied that the great object is the promo- 
tion of the public welfare, and is disconnected from any plans of legislative spolia- 
tion. This is evidenced in the fact that every census has descended into more 
particulars than the last, and found the people more willing to respond. The pub- 
lication and general comprehension of the results increase the public zest for 
more. This will be seen hereafter in referring to the State and city census, and 
other local reports, becoming every where so frequent and so full. Satisfied that 
there is a great purpose to be subserved, the people always acquiesce. Though 
seemingly impertinent, at first sight, to be interrogated in regard to their age, 
their place of birth, their occupation, and degree of education, if they are married 
or single, if there is a deaf or a dumb person in their family, if they own real 
estate, if they cultivate land, and how much of it, what crops they are producing, 
if any of their household have been born or have died within the year, yet, when 
twenty millions of people have responded to these questions, and their answers 
have been digested into tables, and made public, the idea of impertinence falls at 
once to the ground. By questions, such as these, they perceive, can be ascertained 

* The remarkable uniformity in the proportions of the sexes as shown in the table on page 49 ? is an illustra- 
tion in point. For every 100 males in 1790, there were 96.4 females ; in 1800, 95.3; 1810, 96.2 ; 1820, 96.8 ; 1830, 
96.4 ; 1840, 95.6 ; and in 1850, 95; the results of immigration, composed as it is largely of males, being exactly 
indicated.

for cities and States, the proportion of the sexes to each other, indicating the ca 
pacity for industry or development ; the productive power, duration of life, degree 
of health or mortality, the migration of population and its homogeneous or hetero- 
geneous elements, the' occupations which yield the greatest and the least results, or 
are more favorable to longevity, the extent of education imparted, or to which it 
is neglected, how the soil is parcelled out, in what cultivated and how much is the 
distributive share of wealth to each individual, in the several localities. The ex- 
amples are few out of a multitude presenting themselves. Who will then deny 
its great importance to information of this character, or, refuse his cheerful 
co-operation in obtaining it? The extensive publication given to the results of 
the present census — 320,000 bound volumes having been already ordered at dif- 
ferent times, to say nothing of countless other abstracts — will take a copy into 
almost every family, where it must become, to some extent, the subject of con- 
versation and discussion. It is not easy to estimate the effect which this will have 
in diffusing true notions of the nature and character of the census, and in inciting 
the people and the enumerators to greater alacrity and more accuracy in their 
future reports. 

In the United States a general census has been taken every tenth year, begin- 
ning with 1790, the leading results of which are digested in the present volume. 
The first of this series included but five particulars — the white males over and under 
16, the white females, the slaves, and all other free persons, "except Indians, not 
taxed." The second — 1800 — retained the same divisions of class, and distinguish- 
ed the white males and females into ages, under 10, between 10 and 16, 16 and 
26, 26 and 45, and of 45 and over. The third — 1810 — was identical with the 
second, but a schedule of manufactures was ordered to be added, showing the cap- 
ital, labor, material used in manufactures, and the kind and value of the product. 
The fourth. — 1820 — divided the whites as the second had done, but added a cobimn 
for the white males between 16 and 18, and another for foreigners not naturalized, 
with blanks for those of the population employed in agriculture, in commerce, or 
in manufactures. This census regarded also, for the first time, the ages of the 
free colored and slaves, male and female ; under 14, between 14 and 26, between 
26 and 45, and 45 and upwards. A schedule of manufactures, similar to, but an 
improvement on, that of 1810, was appended. By an oversight the column for 
"all other persons," by which was previously meant the "free colored," was 
retained, although this class was specifically mentioned, and the error has given 
rise to subsequent difficulties. The fifth census — 1830 — divided the white males 
and females into ages quinquennially until 20, and decennially afterwards to 100, 
&c; divided the colored and slaves, male and female, into those under 10, between 
10 and 24, 24 and 36, 36 and 55, 55 and 100, 100 and upwards; added columns* 
for the first time, of white and colored deaf and dumb, under 14 years of age,, 
between 14 and 25, of 25 and upwards, and for the blind in the aggregate; also a 
column for aliens not naturalized. No returns of manufactures were embraced. 
The sixth census — 1840 — followed the divisions of age, sex and color in the 
fifth, and the divisions for the deaf, dumb and blind, but added columns feu the 
insane and idiotic, at public or private charge, the universities and colleges, acade- 
mies and schools, students and scholars, scholars at public charge, and adult whites 
who cannot read and write. It also embraced, as a part of the general schedule, 
more full particulars of industry than had been previously obtained. 

These enumerations were published, within one, two, or three years,, severally, 
from the time when they were made, but in such a manner as unfitted them for 
general use, understanding, or reference, and with very little tabular system and 
accuracy. A complete set of them does not exist in the public departments at 
Washington, and one or two are nearly, if not entirely, out of print. A new edi- 
tion of these decennial reports, uniform with the quarto volume of 1850, consi- 
dering the heavy outlay they required, and that they are the only existing records 
of the facts, especially recommends itself. The whole could be embraced in a. 
small type, and by condensation, into a single volume. 



12 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

The Seventh census — or that of 1850 — began a new era, by adopting six in- 
stead of one or two schedules. The first related to the Free Inhabitants, em- 
bracing the number of dwellings and families, and introduces the principle of 
recording the name and sur-name of every free person, old or young, in the Union, 
with their sex, and exact age, from one month upwards; their color, as white, black, 
or mulatto ; their nativity, as born in the State or in some other State or country, 
at home or abroad; their condition, as married or single; their education, as at- 
tending school in the year, or over 20 years of age and unable to read and write. 
The deaf and dumb, blind, insane, idiotic, pauper or convict, and the owners of 
real estate were also noted. 

The second schedule, Slaves, included the names of slaveholders, the sex, color, 
and specific age of the slave, the fugitive, and manumitted, the deaf and dumb, 
blind, insane, and idiotic. 

The third, Mortality, gave the names of such persons as had died within the pre- 
vious year, their age, sex, color, (white, black or mulatto,) whether free or slave, 
married or widowed, their specific place of birth, at home or abroad, the month of 
their decease, the occupation of the person, the duration of the sickness, and the 
cause of death. Remarks upon topography, &c, accompany these schedules, and 
were made by the enumerators. 

The fourth, Agriculture, embraced the name of every farmer or planter, and 
all of the particulars included in the agricultural tables of this volume. 

The fifth, Manufacturing Industry, with the name and location of every person 
or establishment producing over $500 annually ; the quantity, kind, and value of 
raw material used; the motive power, and labor employed, male and female, the 
rate and amount of wages, the quantity, kind, and value of productions, leaving the 
marshals to enter them in detail. 

The sixth, Social statistics, included real and personal estate in each county or 
town ; the several kinds and amounts of taxes levied ; the schools, libraries, news- 
papers; religious, criminal, pauper, and wages statistics as they are now published ; 
and the facts — if the crops were average or not? which of them if any were short, 
and to what extent, and the average annual crop? 

These schedules as well as those of every previous decade may be consulted 
with the instructions that accompanied them, by reference to the introduction of 
the Quarto Census, where they are collected and published ; nearly all the points 
of instruction have however, been referred to in their proper places in the present 
volume. 

Objections were raised in 1840 to the searching nature of the industrial inves- 
tigations, and several counties in Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, as 
there was no penalty attached, refused peremptorily to answer them. It was asked 
by a leading journal "Is this federal prying into the domestic economy of the 
people a precursor to direct taxes? Is nothing to escape ks inquisitors or its tax 
gatherers ? Is it worthy of the dignity and high functions of the federal govern- 
ment to pursue such petty investigations ?" Such objections were rarely raised 
in 1850, and in but two or three cases was it necessary to call in the services of 
the district attorney to enforce the requisitions of the law. 

The schedule of the census of 1840 originated in Congress, and was carried 
through without opposition, upon a suggestion of the President in his annual 
message, that " the decennial enumerations might be extended so as to embrace 
authentic statistical returns of the great interests especially entrusted to or neces- 
sarily affected by the legislation of Congress." 

As the time for taking the last census approached, the whole subject began to 
be agitated again in Congress. It was proposed at the session of 1848 to revive 
the schedules of 1840, omitting only the minute, and as it was thought, objection- 
able inquiries. Against such a course protests were made by statisticians in and 
out of Congress, and N. Capen of Massachusetts, suggested the appointment of 
commissioners for taking the census, and in a letter to a senator from Massachu- 
setts published among tire official document®, recommended that a board of inquiry 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 13 

be appointed to examine and report upon the particulars which should properly 
be embraced, sketching himself some of the leading outlines. The act of 3d 
March, 1849, establishing the Census Board was the result. Mr. Shattiick. of 
Boston, made, also, a similar suggestion to the board when- constituted. In his 
own language : 

* * "A Central Board of three persons, as Commissioners, should he organ- 

ized at Washington. It might be denominated the Central Statistical Department, or Bureau, 
or Commission, or any other appropriate name. These men should be appointed not for their 
political opinions, but for their scientific attainments and knowledge of the matters they are 
to investigate. They should have the whole management of planning and carrying into exe- 
cution all matters relating to the Census. Similar Commissions, should be appointed by this 
Central Board, with the consent of the governors of each state, of three competent persoss in 
each state; and this state commission should appoint district commissions in their state, and 
see that all the facts sought should be obtained in their respective states and districts. By 
this machinery a more perfect collection of facts could be obtained than in any other way. 
The National, State, and District Statistical Bureaus, acting in concert with each other, would 
act intelligently and cheaply, and would accomplish far more and with greater accuracy than 
by any plan heretofore adopted."' 

The Census Board consisted of the Secretary of State, the officer previously en- 
trusted exclusively with the census, the Postmaster General, as it was conceived 
possible the machinery of the Post Office Department might prove adequate to the 
requisitions of the census, or at least greatly auxiliary, and the Attorney General 
whose legal advice would at times be necessary. There was then no Department 
of the Interior, to which when created the whole charge of the work was en- 
trusted. A secretary was appointed, who remained in charge of the census over 
three years, preparing several reports, of which large editions were published. 

At the ensuing session of Congress a special committee upon the census was 
raised in the Senate which went to work assiduously in preparing the schedules, 
unassisted as they alleged by any suggestions from the board, but with some unof- 
ficial ones from its secretary. Pending the discussion upon the plan which the 
committee proposed, another was submitted by the board, very full in its details 
and embracing some of the same points, which was adopted. Mr. Shattuck, who 
was invited to visit Washington near the close of the year 1849, gave the benefit 
of his great experience and statistical knowledge in the preparation of the plan, 
(being afterwards assisted in the same labors by Archibald Russell of Xew York.) 
The general act for taking the census was passed substantially as it was drawn up 
by him, except as to the rate of compensation an,d the ratio of representation. The 
instructions to marshals, prepared by him, were also adopted, but with a few modi- 
fications. The feature of recording the name and description of every person 
enumerated, was proposed by this gentleman, and was first adopted in the Boston 
census of 1845. Neither the blanks for "'real estate owned/' nor for married 
within the year, were his. He drew up the mortality schedule, by request, though 
against his own advice,* and also furnished the schedule of social statistics and 
that in part of slaves. 

* Sec Shattuck's Report on the State Census of Massachusetts, 1850 — also Sanitary report of Massachusetts, 
1850, pp. 126-133. appendix 375. A more limited census had been originally recommended bv this gentleman, 
Dr. Jarvis, and others in a memorial to Congress. The Census Board Reported to Congress. March 19, 1850, as 
follows : 

" At the request of the secretary of the board, during the autumn we invited the assistance of two other 
persons, who had bestowed much attention on the subject, to an examination of the work and its arrangement 
previous to its final adoption ; and after a full consideration of all their suggestions, we then agreed upon a full 
set of schedules, and ordered them to be delivered to the printer we had employed for the purpose of printing 
ihem. 

" After thus terminating our labors, In obedience to the law, we requested the persons we had employed to 
assist us, in connexion with the secretary of the board, to submit for our approval a set of instructions to the 
marshals, necessary to carry into effect the objects we' had in view in making the schedules." 

The plan of the Senate committee was very extended, embracing ten schedules and a multitude of particu- 
lars. Some reference to it may be of future value. 

Schedcle 1. Those engaged in Agriculture — embracing the head of the family's name, his place of birth, if 
out of the state; his male and female apprentices, those in his house who cannot read and write, and those of 
all of the usual ages, under 5, of 5 and 10, &c, male and female, and the ages of the male and female slaves: 
Heads of families of the free colored, their ages and sex as of the white ^Aliens in the family, name of the 
head, male aliens under and over 21 years of age, female aliens under and over 18 years of age. 

Schedule 2. Those in Mechanic Arts — the same particulars as in agriculture, except that the name of the 
business was added, the number of journeymen, the yearly wages paid to them, the number of laborers en- 
gaged in the shop or business, the stone, brick or wood houses wholly or partially built. 



14 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

In regard to the six schedules which were at last adopted, though they ar6 
conceded to be a great improvement upon any previous ones, several particulars 
were omitted, which ought to have been included, at the expense of others much 
less important. The adoption of so many schedules, whatever merits they indi- 
vidually have, was calculated to make the work unnecessarily cumbersome and 
expensive, without securing by any means greater or more certain results. On 
the contrary, it precluded the possibility of some very valuable comparisons, and 
made unattainable information easily secured by another arrangement. For ex- 
ample : if a slave existed in a non-slaveholding State, he would not by the sche- 
dules be returned, nor can any of the facts relating to slaveholders now be ascer- 
tained — such as, their nativity, age, occupation, education, &c. ; nor can the deaths 
of individuals be associated with families, and with the remainder living in fami- 
lies, without almost impracticable labor. The schedules are otherwise admirable. 

It will not be out of place to suggest, as the result of experience acquired dur- 
ing eighteen months familiarity with the returns, an outline for the next decen- 
nial census, which may possibly afford some aid also to those who are engaged in 
framing the forms for State and city enumerations, now becoming almost annual. 

It is sua;2:ested that there be but two schedules hereafter — one of Population, 
and the other of Production. These, with proper instructions to the enumerators, 
will include all of the information embraced at present in six, and a great deal 
besides, in a form much more compact and less expensive. 

Schedule 3. Tltose engaged in Commerce — the same particulars as the last, including clerks and the wages 
paid to them. 

Schedule 4. Tfiose not engaged in Agriculture, Arts, or Commerce — treated as those in agriculture. 

Schedule 5. The Idiots, Lunatics, Deaf and Dumb, Blind and Paupers — male or female, their ages, and the age 
when lunacy was discovered, and the occupation of the party: The sex, age and occupation of Deaf and Dumb 
and Blind and Idiots. The same for slaves and free colored, and whether the party were supported by public 
charity, or by friends or by his own means. Paupers, foreign or native not affected as above at public charge 
in the last year. 

Schedule 6. Agricultural Statistics — name of the farmer, his improved and unimproved land, his laborers 
over 15 years old employed in tillage. The other particulars of crops, &c, as in the present volume, except 
that turnips, indigo, fodder, number of hogs and sheep slaughtered, houses built, were added to the list of 
products. 

Schedule 7. Manufactures when other power is used than that of the man himself — name of the owner, presi- 
dent or superintendent ; grist mills — number of pairs of stones ; saw mills — number of saws employed, quantity 
of lumber, planks, &c, in feet made per annum; cotton gins; wool carding machines; cotton mills — number

other description of iron ; anthracite furnaces; charcoal furnaces — quantity of castings and pig metal made 
per annum ; silk manufactories — quantity of goods produced annually ; hemp and flax manufactories — quanti-

number of males employed over 18 years of age, number of females employed under 15 years of age, number 
of females employed over 15 years of age, average wages paid to men per annum, average wages paid to boys 
per annum, average wages paid to women per annum, average wages paid to girls per annum ; water, principal 
agent in propelling machinery, horses ditto, number of horses, mules or oxen employed; locomotive manu- 
factories ; machine shops and hands employed and value of annual productions. 

Schedule 8. Mining Interests — owner, superintendent or manager's name ; gold mines — number of laborers 
employed, quantity of ounces raised preceding year; silver mines — number of laborers employed, quantity of 
ounces raised ; lead mines — number of laborers employed, number of pounds smelted during preceding year, 
value of the lead per pound at the furnace; copper mines — number of laborers employed, number of pounds

the margin of the returns, and also such as are used for boarding houses, hotels, 
asylums, colleges, jails, barracks, etc. Column 3. There will be no greater diffi- 
culty in separating the living and the dead upon the returns than is now expe- 
rienced in separating the deaf and dumb, &c. 4. The ages under one year should 
be given in months ; those between 1 and 3 years in quarters of a year, as recom- 
mended by Quetelet ; those of 3 years and over in years. 6. The introduction 
of Slaves and of Indians domesticated does not at all complicate this column. 
Domesticated Indians are reckoned by the New York census. 8. The omission 
of this head from the present schedule was a cardinal defect, and closed the door 
upon a multitude of valuable facts. It is included in the British and Boston 
census. 9. This column is equally important, and is a new one. 11. Another 
proposed column, though these facts may be deduced, with some pains, from the 
column of ages. 12. New, also, and essential to any correct reasonings upon the 
extent of families, the number of children to each, etc. 14. Perhaps it would 
be better to indicate every person over 10 years of age who cannot read and 
write, and then those over 20 can be deduced for comparison with previous returns. 
15. Changed from the present so as to denote whether the party was born in the 
town, city or county of his residence, or in another part of the same State, etc. 
(embraced in Boston and English census.) 17. Valuable for statistical purposes, 
and especially so in vital statistics. 17, 18. The United States census of 1820 
and 1830 included naturalized foreigners. 18. It might be well to know the 
number of persons actually confined from illness, as an important element in the 
sanitary statistics. This column, in case of deceased persons, will show the 
number of clays or months they have been sick. 19. Perhaps it would be better 
to say died within one month, as it is next to impossible for persons to report from 
memory facts for a whole year. In this case a separate column for month of de- 
cease is obviated. 20. The deaf ought to be taken as well as the deaf and dumb, 
as explained in this volume. Insane and idiotic should not be separated, as they 
are popularly confounded ; and persons receiving partial relief ought to be distin 
guished from paupers. Pensioners of the United States, if included as was once 
or twice done, would put an end to many of the frauds so frequent upon the Gov- 
ernment. 23 refers to houses owned by the party.

The schedule of Industry for 1850, with slight alterations, will answer perfectly 
for all mechanical, manufacturing, mining, agricultural and commercial interests. 
The directions should be printed at the top. If the interest b.e agricultural, under 
division 3 would be included the acres cultivated, the acres occupied, the new 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 17 

land taken into cultivation, the acres in each of the crops and in pastures, the 
value of the farm and of its implements and machinery. Under division 4 the 
number of each description of live stock. Column 5 will show any mills in use 
on the farm. Column 6, all persons over 12 years of age actually employed on 
the farm. Column 7, blank on a slave interest. 8 to include bushels, jiounds, 
&c. of each of the following articles, or any others, (dispensing with hhds., tons 
and bales, which lead to confusion and incompleteness, as experience has shown.) 
wheat, rye, corn, oats, rice, tobacco, cotton, wool, peas and beans. Irish potatoes, 
sweet potatoes, barley, buckwheat, fruit, wine, market gardens, butter, cheese, hay, 
clover, other grass seed, hops, hemp — dew and water-rotted, flax, flax-seed, silk co- 
coons, sugar — cane or maple, molasses, beeswax and honey, home-made manufac- 
tures. &e. 

There is no greater propriety in ruling out separate columns for each agricul- 
tural product or article of live stock, than in having such columns . for the articles 
of raw material used, or of annual products in the manufacturing schedule. There 
were no such columns in that schedule, and aggregates from the returns are as 
simple and as easily comprehended without them. All that is necessary is to print 
at the head of the schedules a list of such articles as the enumerators will be 
instructed to call over. A great many columns will increase the space to be occu- 
pied, and increase also the chances of error by making it more probable that facts 
will fall out of their proper division. Xot one man in fifty will furnish an 
entry for half of the blanks in the present agricultural schedule.* 

These schedules include all that at present require six. excepting only the valua- 
tion of real and personal estate, the amount of taxes, the cost of pauperism, and the 
average crop per acre : facts which an intelligent superintendent could procure 
easily from the State reports or from correspondence with the county officers, as 
has been done before with but little expense. The schools, colleges, &c., and 
their means of support, can all be obtained when the schoolmaster is called upon 
for enumeration, or when the school or college is visited. The entries may be 
made upon the back of the returns. If a private teacher, and not a school teacher. 
the fact should be stated. Facts for churches can be obtained when the clergy- 
man is called upon, as also for Sunday school scholars and libraries. Those for 
newspapers and periodicals, together with a copy of the paper, on calling upon the 
editor : from librarians obtain the number of volumes. Particulars are thus ob- 
tained for the British census and the difficulties which present themselves, (such 
as a clergyman with several churches or a church with several clergymen, &c.) 
can be easily obviated by careful and well digested instructions. " Public paupers"' 
and •'•'criminals." are all in schedule 1. and arranged much better. The "'cost of 
labor'' ;i Seasons," etc., are in schedule 2. 

But however perfect may be the schedules of a census, if a corresponding perfec- 
tion is not found in the machinery for taking it in the field, and for aggregating and 
oonibining it. and deducing the results in the office, little advantage will be gained 
upon the score of accuracy or of sound science. These two subjects, therefore — the 
enumerators and collators, will receive a moment's attention. 

The Entmeratoes. The persons who have been entrusted with the work in 
the United States at every census, have been, in general, found (so low was the 
rate of compensation.) among those who were willing to undertake it. rather than 
among those who would have been selected for their especial fitness. Political ser- 
vice has also entered into the element of qualification. That the latter should have 
great weight, is not surprising, considering how the appointments are provided for, 
but so ample was the remuneration in 1850 that capacity might well have been 
secured. An examination of the returns and the correspondence of the office will 

* Americans resident abroad should be ascertained through the State Department. Circumstances giving a 
temporary enlargement to the population of a neighborhood, such as the construction of a rail road, canal, etc. 
ought also to be noted. In many of the old and thickly settled States, the English plan of enumeration in a 
single day, and by means <tf householders schedules, left in advance to be filled up by heads of families, on the 
day preceding the census w practicable, and recommends itself for accuracy and perhaps for economy. The 
time is very far off, it is feared, when it can be applied with any advantage for the general census throughout 
all the States and Territories of the Union,

show that capacity was as often the exception as the rule. It would be better to 
entrust the work to the regular officers of each county, employed by them for 
assessments and taxation purposes, or in general, for taking the census as will be 
seen hereafter, provided for by local authority. There are no counties without 
such officers, and it may be safely assumed that if not always among the most 
educated, they will at least have the advantage of some previous familiarity with 
the business upon which they are employed and recognize an accountability that 
may affect their future positions. If the fact however explained, that these per- 
sons are a part of the recognized tax machinery, might be supposed to interfere 
with their receiving correct returns, the recourse must then be had to a better sys- 
tem of appointments requiring proof of education and experience and some general 
knowledge of statistical investigations. In Great Britain the census has been en- 
trusted to the overseers of the poor, the parochial school masters, or to the office of 
the Registrar-General and his subordinates, all of them permanent. 

The Office. Unless there is machinery in advance at the seat of Government 
no census can ever be properly taken and published. There is a peculiar education 
required for these labors which neither comes from zeal or genius, but is the result 
only of experience. They are the most irksome and trying imaginable, requiring 
inexhaustible patience and endurance, and baffling almost every effort after accu- 
racy. Long familiarity can alone secure system, economy and certainty of result. 
This office machinery exists in all European countries where statistics are the most 
reliable, but there has been none of it in the United States. Each census has taken 
care of itself. Every ten years some one at Washington will enter the hall of a 
department, appoint fifty or a hundred persons under him, who, perhaps, have never 
compiled a table before, and are incapable of combining a column of figures cor- 
rectly. Hundreds of thousands of pages of returns are placed in the hands of such 
persons to be digested. If any are qualified it is no merit of the system. In 1840 
returns were given out by the job to whoever would take them. In 1850, such was 
the pressure of work, that almost any one could at times have had a desk. Contrast 
this with the English system and reflect that one individual, as hereafter remarked, 
presided over the census of 1801, '11, '21 and '31. In Washington, as soon as an 
office acquires familiarity with statistics, and is educated to accuracy and activity, 
it is disbanded, and even the best qualified employee is suffered to depart. The 
government may rely upon paying heavily for the experience which is being ac- 
quired. Even the head of the office, whatever his previous training, must expect, 
if faithful, to learn daily ; and it is not going too far to say that a matter of one oi 
two hundred thousand dollars is the difference between the amount which a census 
would cost, conducted by an office which has had the experience of a previous 
one, (even if partly or entirely in new hands, which might often be desirable, 
since the machinery, as in other offices, would be kept up,) and an office without such 
experience. This can be demonstrated if required. Half of that amount would 
sustain an office of several persons from census to census and defray all of the ex- 
penses of an annual or biennial report after the closing of the regular one, which 
itself would be executed with despatch, with greatly less force, and with a more eco- 
nomical and wiser application of labor. The permanent force would have no other 
interest than the prompt execution of the work. 

The establishment of a regular statistical Office is therefore suggested, as a 
matter of economy, and essential to the proper execution of the census. In it 
would be collected — and they could be obtained without expense by exchange — 
official statistical reports, upon any subject whatever, published by every city, 
town, county, or State in the Union, or in any other part of the world. The 
absence of such documents in Washington was severely felt during the whole 
progress of the present census, although the former Superintendent obtained many 
by a visit to Europe, and others were subsequently sent by Mr. Vattemare, of Paris, 
and Mr. Hubner, of Berlin, and by the several states and cities which politely 
furnished such as were especially asked. All of this created labor and delay. 
The office* ought also to be provided with a complete statistical library, and

with all the leading statistical journals in the world, together with maps, charts, 
&c. The returns of immigration and of foreign consuls could be sent to it, espe- 
cially such as are in answer to circulars that were lately prepared in obedience to a 
call of Congress. A digest of such material, published annually or semi-annually, 
in a small and compact volume, would keep up the results of the general census to 
date, and shed no little light upon the industry and general and comparative wealth 
of the country. It would have charge of the manuscript volumes of every census, 
and respond to calls made by Congress in regard to them, or upon other kindred 
matters. Duties somewhat similar to these were performed by Mr. Porter for the 
English Grovernment, and a Bureau of Statistics, as will be seen hereafter, exists in 
most of the European governments.. 

Such a bureau is recommended, also, in each of the States ; and it would be the 
means of corresponding with the Central office, furnishing very much of the mate- 
rial to be aggregated by it. It has been proposed in South Carolina,* Rhode 
Island, Virginia, and Illinois, and was actually established in Louisiana.! but 
failed for the want of adequate legislation, after reports had been puWished upon 
about half of the parishes. The city of Xew York has such a bureau. In every 
State there are the materials for one with but little expense, if properly organized. 
The various local census, assessments of property and production, reports on 

*A special committee of the legislature of South Carolina, in the session of 1548, after having ably shown in 
a variety of instances how little information existed in regard to the resources of that State, declare : •'•' There 
are facts and considerations which, properly exhibited, would prove the necessity of providing some such organ- 
ization as would lead to a correct understanding of these important matters ; and the insufficiency of the mat- 
ters here presented only serves to show conclusively that we have been heretofore neglectful of those means of 
information which are calculated to elicit correct apprehensions of our advantages and duties. The establish- 
ment of an efficient bureau of statistics will be the means of collecting and disseminating statistical informa- 
tion touching all the interests of the State, of the most valuable kind.*-" The Governor, in his annual message 
to the legislature of the same State, says, " I recommend the careful collection of statistical information on all 
the branches of industry. By the possession of facts and materials, lucidly arranged and methodized, we shall 
be furnished with complete data as to the present state of the population, white and colored, their agriculture, 
commerce, navigation, manufactures, trade, finance, health, and indeed of whatever may be interesting or 
instructive."

20 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

schools, asylums, penitentiaries, boards of health and commerce, furnish abundant 
details. Hundreds of other facts could be ascertained when the local assessments 
are made, with little if any more cost. The State and city census should be made 
to correspond, as far as possible, with the national, and be provided for at some 
intervening period. At present they are often taken in the same year, thus 
entailing a great waste of labor. The time is at hand when the several State 
governments should look to this matter ; and as it was deemed important for 
European statisticians to meet in convention in order to bring about uniformity 
in their several systems, the States should also secure uniformity. A meeting 
of persons properly appointed by each, and fitted for the duties, would be the 
means of maturing some practical plan of co-operation. 

In 1845 the subject of a statistical bureau was before Congress, and two very 
able and elaborate reports were made in its advocacy. A bill was introduced 
providing for the collection of material relating to all the great Industrial interests 
of the countrv to be published in an annual report by the Secretary of the Treas- 
ury, who was authorized to constitute an office of several persons for the purpose. 
The Secretary himself recommended that authority be given him to appoint 
a chief of the bureau with an appropriate salary, two assistants, and one clerk. 
"A statistical bureau," he says, "properly organized and supported, will be 
able to respond promptly and correctly to all calls by Congress for information 
on statistical subjects, save great waste of time and money, and furnish informa- 
tion highly interesting and useful to the great body of the people." The result 
of the movement, however, was a failure, in consequence of a single clerk only y 
with a small salary, being detached for the service. 

What the agricultural department of the Patent Office is doing for agriculture, 
it is proposed that this office shall do for the great Industrial interests ; gathering 
and combining their results, and developing them in connexion with the move- 
ment of population, and the growth or decline of cities and states. 

Before closing these remarks, it will be proper to show what is now accomplished 
by the several foreign and State governments, as well as by the larger cities, in 
regard to statistical investigations. The information will be valuable, and has 
been obtained from official reports ; and for our country, from replies made to 
circular letters directed to the Secretaries of State and leading geologists and sta- 
tisticians in every part of the Union. 

The decennial system of enumeration adopted in the United States has been 
imitated by Great Britain, beginning with the census of 1801. In Denmark a 
statistical central commission exists, which published eighteen large volumes of sta 
tistics between 1835 and 1849 ; subsequently ten volumes have been published by 
a central bureau. In Bavaria there is a statistical bureau. In Austria one was 
established in 1828, and besides the yearly statistics, there have been published 
in the last four years monthly and quarterly reports of foreign statistics, including 
the report of consuls. In France every ministry publishes its own statistics, 
though some have special bureaus. Those of Finance and Commerce have pub- 
lished thirteen volumes on finance, population, industry, &c. Individual effort is 
combined with official by establishing in every district statistical commissions 
which fill up the blanks, &c. To the commissions are assigned the reports on 
population, foundlings, beggars, &c. A census has been published every five years 
beginning with 1841. In Saxony a statistical bureau exists which has published 
three volumes. In Spain the census is rarely taken ; M. Madoz prepared a Sta- 
tistical and Geographical Dictionary of Spain in sixteen volumes by sending com- 
missions into every part of the country. There are frequent statistical reports in 
relation to Cuba. In Sardinia, in 1820, a commission to collect- statistics was 
established, with which thirty-seven juntas, of six members each, corresponded ; 
four large volumes have been published. In Hollana a statistical bureau was 
established in 1826, which published several volumes' A census was published 
in 1840 ; there is now no general bureau. In Wurtemtyirg a bureau has pub- 
lished thirty-three volumes. In Switzerland detailed reports have been received

since 1830 from nearly all the cantons. Zurich has a census of population made 
two hundred and twenty years ago. In Portugal there was a census in 1838, 
1843, 1849, and 1851. In Russia there is a system of registration of births, &c, 
and occasionally a census has been ordered. In Sweden a board of table commis- 
sion digests the returns of population supplied by the clergy. The census con- 
siders the people as having subsistence, or less or more than subsistence. In 
Norway there is a census by the magistrates in the towns, and rectors in the coun- 
try; and inquiries extend to productions, occupations, deaf and dumb, &c. The 
Prussian census is taken every three years ; that of 1849 gives ages, sex, faith, oc- 
cupation, deaf and dumb, &c, education, schools, churches, asylums, dwellings, and 
families. There are lists of population in Prussia running back to 1748. In 1805 
a statistical bureau was established, and eleven volumes have been published by 
it, as, also, every fortnight a statistical journal. In Belgium the town and country 
population are distinguished; the sex, ages, married, widowed, occupation, faith, 
language, number of floors or parts of the house, gardens, protection against fire, 
degree of instruction, &c. The early population of England was in much dispute 
until 3Ir. Rickman, in 1836, addressed a letter to the clergy and obtained their 
returns as far back as 1570. The census of 1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831, were 
each superintended by Mr. Rickman, clerk of the House of Commons, and the 
business of the enumeration was conducted by the overseers of the poor in Eng- 
land and Wales, and the parochial schoolmasters in Scotland. In 1841 and 1851 
the duty devolved upon the Registrar-General and his subordinates. The 
census was taken in one day, and in 1851 employed 38,740 persons as enumera- 
tors. 

The first census of Great Britain included the sex, but not the age ; also the 
number of houses and the occupations ; the second made some improvements in 
the mode of recording the occupations ; the third carried out the plan, but dis- 
tinguished the ages Cjuinquennially and decennially; the fourth effected im- 
portant changes in the mode of ascertaining occupations, (a subject full of diffi- 
culty at all times,) calculated areas, &c.; the fifth embraced the general features 
of the sixth and last, which is worthy of minute consideration. 

Of the sixth census of Great Britain, 1851, four bulky quarto volumes have 
been published by the Registrar-General, Major Graham, assisted by Dr. Farr 
and Horace Mann. Each of the fourteen divisions of the empire is prepared sepa- 
rately, and is illustrated by handsome district and county maps and other draw- 
ings, indexes, See. The volumes include the number of the people, distinguishing 
male and female ; the number of houses occupied, unoccupied, and building ; the 
statistics of public worship, with a condensation of every previous census. In 
other volumes the ages of the population will be given, their birth-place, condition 
as regards marriage and occupation, the returns of schools, colleges, and other 
institutions ; the number of blind, deaf and dumb, etc. 

"The inquiries undertaken at the census of 1851 were of a far more extensive character than 
those pursued at any previous enumeration, for it was resolved to exhibit not onlv the statis- 
tics of parishes, and of parliamentary and municipal boroughs, but also of such 'other large 
towns in England and Scotland as appeared sufficiently important for separate mention, and 
the statistics of all the ecclesiastical districts and new ecclesiastical parishes which, during 
the last forty years, had been created in England and Wales. In addition, also, to the inquiry 
concerning the occupation, age, and birth-place of the population, it was determined to ascer- 
tain various relationships, such as husband, wife, son, daughter, — the civil condition, as 
married, unmarried, widower or widow, — and the number" of blind, or deaf and dumb. 
Moreover, the design was formed of collecting statistics as to the accommodation afforded by 
the various churches and other places of public worship throughout the country, and the 
number of persons generally frequenting them ; also as to existing educational establishments, 
and the actual number of scholars under instruction. 

The local machinery by which the objects thus contemplated were to be obtained, differed 
considerably in England and Scotland. In England and Wales the registration districts, 
which, for the most part, are conterminous with the unions, were made available for enume- 
rating the population. Of these districts there were 624, each having a superintendent re- 
gistrar ; and these were divided into 2,190 sub-districts, each having a local registrar of births 
and deaths. Under the supervision of their 624 superintendents, "the 2,190 registrars were 
directed to form their sub-districts into enumeration districts, according to certain instructions. 



22 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

The number of such enumeration districts in England and Wales was 30,610, each district 
being the portion assigned to one enumerator, who was required to complete his enumeration 
in one day. 

In Scotland, which is, unfortunately, without any system of registration, the census was 
taken through the agency of the sheriffs of counties, and the provosts, or other chief magis- 
trates of royal and parliamentary burghs. The sheriffs generally assigned their functions to 
the sheriff's substitute, who appointed a fit person, generally the parochial schoolmaster, in 
each parish, to divide it into enumeration districts, and to superintend the proceedings of, 
the census therein. The same course was adopted by the provosts of burghs within their re- 
spective jurisdictions, which, for the occasion included the parliamentary limits of the burgh 
in cases where that boundary extended beyond the royalty. The number of parishes in Scot- 
land including those in royal and parliamentary burghs, were 1,010, and that number of di- 
viders, or superintendents were appointed. The number of enumeration districts formed by 
them throughout Scotland was 7,873. 

In the Islands of the British seas dividers of parishes were appointed, in like manner, by 
the respective Lieutenant-Governors, and 25*7 enumeration districts were similarly formed. 
Public institutions, such as work-houses, prisons, asylums, hospitals, and the like, were 
treated as districts of themselves, provided they contained upwards of 200 inmates. 

In this manner the whole surface of Great Britain and of the small adjacent islands was 
divided into suitable districts, and an equal number of enumerators appointed. Thus pro- 
vision was made for obtaining an account of all persons residing on land within the above 
named territory, on the night of the 30th March. 

The first step taken by the enumerators was to deliver to every occupier of a house or tene- 
ment a householder 's schedule. Upon this schedule inquiry was made as to the name, relation 
to head of family, condition, sex, age, occupation and birth-place of every person in Great 
Britain, and also as to how many of them were blind, or deaf and dumb. For the use of the 
poorer native population of Wales, a certain number of forms were printed in the language 
of that country. The total number of schedules forwarded from the Census Office was 
•7,000,000, weighing some 40 tons, or if the blank enumeration books and other forms are in- 
cluded, upwards of 52 tons. The schedule was to be filled up on the night named. No one 
present on that night was to be omitted, and no person absent was to be included, except 
miners, potters, and other work people usually engaged at their labor during the night, and 
regularly returning home in the morning; or policemen and others on night duty. Persons 
travelling were enumerated at the hotels or houses at which they arrived on the following 
morning. 

At the same time that these schedules were distributed, the enumerators delivered forms for 
collecting information respecting places of worship, scholastic establishments, and miscella- 
neous institutions, but it was , optional with the respective parties to decline making these 
returns if they thought proper. 

When a house was uninhabited, or in progress of building, the enumerators made a note 
of such a case upon the schedule last collected, by which means the unoccupied houses and 
houses in course of erection, were enumerated. The number of inhabited houses were indi- 
cated by the number of householder's schedules filled up. 

Having collected all the schedules, filling up those which the parties neglected or were unable 
to fill, and eopied them into books prepared on an uniform plan, the enumerators summed 
the various totals in their respective districts. The totals thus obtained expressed the number 
of persons who were inmates of dwelling-houses on the night of the census, with the special 
addition of certain classes on night duty ; but several classes had yet to be enumerated, viz., 
the persons who, on the night named, slept or abode in barges, or boats remaining stationary 
on canals or small streams ; in barns, sheds, and the like ; and in tents or in the open air. 
The number of these in each district were estimated by the respective enumerators ; the esti- 
mate, however, was not to include people in coasting or other sea-going vessels, as they would 
be dealt with by other means yet to be described. Where, for some extraordinary reason, a 
large number of persons belonging to a neighborhood were absent from it, or a large number 
of strangers were, present, the enumerator was required to note the fact on the return. 

The enumerators were allowed one week for the transcription of the contents of the house- 
holder's schedules into the enumeration book, and for the completion of the various sum- 
maries and estimates. The schedules and book, together with the returns relating to schools 
and places of worship, were then forwarded to the respective registrars, and the duties of the 
38,740 enumerators terminated. The census returns were now in the hands of 3,220 regis- 
trars, or dividers of districts. 

The registrars immediately commenced a careful and systematic examination and revision 
of the documents described, directing their attention, according to instructions, to nine spe 
cially defined points in respect to them. They then prepared a summary of the statements 
of the enumerators in their respective districts, and transmitted them, together with the enu- 
meration books, to the superintendent-registrar, for a further revision by that officer, forward- 
ing the householders' schedules and returns for places of worship and schools direct to the 
census office. With the completion of these duties, for which a fortnight was allowed, the 
functions of the 3,220 registrars, or dividers of districts, ceased. The summaries and enu- 
meration books (as far as England and Wales were concerned) were now in the hands of 624 
superintendent-registrars. 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 23 

The chief duties of the superintendant-registrars -were to expedite the investigation, but 
thev had also further to revise the summaries and enumeration books, and to transmit them 
to the Census Office, there to undergo a still further revision before the commencement of the 
abstracts. 

A complete enumeration ■was thus effected of all persons resident upon the land of Great 
Britain, and on canals and small streams ; but, as before mentioned, an important portion of 
the population remained yet to be reached, viz., persons on board vessels in harbors and navi- 
gable rivers, and those at sea in ships belonging either to the royal navy or to the merchant 
service. As. however, only a certain portion of the persons on board vessels can be properly 
described as residents in the country, those only who slept on board vessels actually lying in 
harbor, or in the navigable rivers of the interior, on the night of the 30th of March, were in- 
cluded in the population of Great Britain ; but the numbers of those at sea in vessels engaged 
in the home trade ; those absent in ships bound to foreign parts ; and those in the royal navy, 
were recorded as valuable collateral information. Considerable arrangements were requisite 
to enemerate these. 

The enumeration of persons on board vessels in harbors, and in the navigable rivers of the 
interior, was accomplished by the officers of the customs. The officers of the respective ports 
left a schedule on board every ship in port or in dock in Great Britain and Ireland, on the 
night of the census, and on the following morning collected the returns, filled up by the re- 
spective masters. Ships engaged in the home trade, and being at sea on the night of the 
census, were supplied with forms either before their departure or on their return, which were 
collected as they arrived in British ports. The ports on the coasts of the United Kingdom are 
122 in number, and are subdivided into 253 sub-ports. The seamen abroad on the night of 
the 30th of March, in vessels belonging to the British merchant service, were traced to all 
parts of the world by means of the registry of merchant seamen, and enumerated from the lists 
under the superintendence of the Registrar of merchant seamen. The seamen in the royal 
navy and the royal marines were returned by the officers in command, in conformity with in- 
structions issued by the Lords of the Admiralty. 

By the machinery explained, all that was necessary in regard to the census of Great Britain 
was accomplished ; but further valuable returns were obtained, presenting a view, in a collec- 
tive form, of certain important classes of the community already enumerated among the gen- 
eral population ; as, for instance, the army at home and in the colonies, or on board ship in 
transitu : half-pay officers and pensioners ; the civil service ; the civilians and European troops 
in the East India Company's service, and British subjects of European origin not in the Com- 
pany's service, the latest returns ®f the population of the colonies : and through the interven- 
tion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the number of British subjects in the sev- 
eral States of Belgium, France, Greece, Russia, Sardinia, Saxony, Turkey, the two Sicilies, 
3hina. Persia, Egypt and Mexico. 

In two months from the taking of the census, the householders' schedules, amounting to 
about 4.300.000 distinct returns, and the enumeration books, nearly 39.000 in number were 
received at the census office ; and the result of the enumeration being obtainable from the 
s-ummaries forwarded with the books, a rough statement of the total population and number 
of houses was transmitted on the Tth of June, ten weeks from the ni^ht of the census, to the 
Secretary of State, and at once made public. 

With the view to secure accuracy in the census, it was considered an indispensable process 
to examine every total and summary throughout the enumerators' returns ; accordingly a 
minute revision of the whole was undertaken, involving the examination and totaling of 
more than 20 millions of entries, contained on upwards of 1,250.000 pages of the enumerators' 
books ; and thus the figures forming the groundwork of the abstracts to be prepared of the 
numbers of the people, their occupations, birth-places, and condition as regards marriage, 
were finally settled and determined." [See Compendium of British Census.] 

Having taken a rapid survey of the United States and European census and 
statistical system, some remarks will be appropriate upon that of the several 
States and cities of the Union. 

Alabama. — There is a census every six years, the last being in 1850, which 
cost §9,594, and was taken by persons appointed by the court of, each county. 
Assessments are made every year. Reports on penitentiary and other subjects 
annual. Explorations have been made by Mr. Tuomey and Mr. Bromby, upon the 
inexhaustable coal fields of the State, and others by Mr. Hale, of 3Iobile. Traces 
of copper, sulphurate of lead and antimony were discovered. 

Arkansas. — A census every four years; last in 1854, and embraced population 
divided into sex and certain ages; acres in cotton and grain, production of cotton, 
wheat, corn and oats. Cost of census §10,000. Assessments annual by sheriffs. 
Partial geological explorations have been made. 

Connecticut. — There is no regular census. Assessments annual by a board of 
assessors, acting upon the reports of parties ; includes real and personal property 
taxable, annual reports upon banks, deaf and dumb and insane, schools, rail roads,

&c. with great minuteness. Reports upon the geology of the State were made hj 
Professor Percival, and also by Professor Shepard. 

California. — A State census was taken, with many particulars, in 1852. Cost 
$80,000. Another is provided for by law in 1855. The assessment of property 
annual. Regular reports of hospitals, &c. Geological report of J. B. Trask, 
published by the Legislature in 1853. 

Florida. — Census in every ten years — last 1845; expense $2,237.59; taken 
by assessors and collectors of counties ; includes all classes of population. Assess- 
ments annual by regular assessors, and children between five and eighteen ascer- 
tained at the same time. Regular reports upon the State lands from State engi- 
neer and geologist. 

Georgia. — Census every seven years — last in 1852; cost $25,000; embraced 
white males between six and sixteen, females six and fifteen, total male and fe- 
male, total colored and slave, families, deaf, dumb, blind, lunatics, &c. Population 
returned 935,000, exclusive of three counties. Assessments annual through tax re- 
ceivers. Biennial reports by the governor on State institutions. Education reports 
annual. Census takers appointed by county courts. An appropriation was made 
many years ago for a geological survey under Dr. Cotting, which was, however, 
not carried through. A partial report was printed, but not circulated. It is said 
a granite vein penetrates and in some places passes through the gneiss, mica 
and talcose slates in Columbia county about six miles above Richmond, and from 
this point to the south-eastward gneiss, mica slate, talcose slate and chloride slate 
formations exist. On these rest beds of clay, underlaid with beds of gravel. 
Animal remains occur lower in the valley. Fine particles of gold have been 
found in the gravel beds. Iron and manganese are the predominating colorings in 
the sand and gravel. The slate contains veins of arroganite, beds of spidote and 
small beds of limestone with specimens of sulphuret of iron and sulphuretted 
copper. 

Iowa. — Census every two years by the constitution — latest in 1852 and 1854; 
expense paid by counties ; taken by township assessors, who assess property every 
year. Annual reports upon education, &c. Last census embraced males and fe- 
males, voters, militia, foreigners not naturalized, deaf, dumb, blind, &c. Each 
town and village to be separated. For the geology of Iowa, see Owen's report on 
the Northwest. 

Illinois. — Census every ten years — last in 1845. Cost $9,738 ; taken by com- 
missioners appointed by county courts. Assessments of personal property annual, 
of real, biennial. Regular reports upon education, &c. A geological survey is 
now in progress, with an appropriation of $10,000, under Dr. J. G-. Norwood, 
and has extended over a considerable portion of the State. The work of Dr. 
Owen may also be consulted. A survey of Northern Illinois some years ago was 
published in Silliman's Journal. 

Indiana. — Census every six years — last in 1853; cost about $4,000. Taken 
by townships. Assessors include white males over 21. Assessment every year of 
personal, and every five years of real property. Regular reports from State board 
of agriculture, and annual returns of farm and mechanical products, also of edu- 
cation, deaf and dumb, blind, insane, &c. The governor has frequently recom- 
mended a statistical bureau. 

Kentucky. — There is no regular census. Regular reports are made on internal 
improvements, public institutions, deaf and dumb, blind and lunatic asylums, && 
A geological survey of Kentucky has recently been commenced by Dr. D. D. 
Owen, the State geologist. Operations were begun in the south-western part of 
the State, and between the mouth of Tradewater and Anvil Rock, a distance of 
about eight miles, eleven beds of coal, thick enough to be worked to advantage, 
have been found. These beds vary from two to five feet. Eleven others have 
been discovered, varying from four inches to two feet, and Dr. O. thinks, from indi- 
cations he has seen, that there are probably six other beds from two and a half to 
five feet thick, lying above the part of the coal measures he has examined. 



INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. o 



D 



Louisiana. — A regular census taken — latest in 1853; embracing -white, free 
colored and slave, number of electors, white males between 18 and 45. The State 
reports of education and of public institutions, banks, internal improvements, hos- 
pitals, asylums, annually, are very complete. A bureau of statistics was estab- 
lished a few years ago, as previously adverted to. A geological, botanical and 
natural history survey of the State was partially made a few years ago at large 
expense, but the reports were not published and are lost. 

Maryland. — There is no stated time for a census. Assessments every ten years 
provided for by counties and cities. Surveys have been made by Dueatel and 
Alexander, which were published by the State. There are other reports by Dr. 
Higgins, State chemist. In regard to the geology of Maryland it is stated that 
the Eastern Shore is free from mountain chains or elevated table lands, the highest 
elevation being less than 100 feet above tidewater level, and the entire region 
almost wholly unexplored. Shell marl abounds everywhere, containing innumer- 
able varieties of fossil shells, tombs of the Moluscae of a former world (Consult 
L veil's map of United States.) Near the estuaries of the Chesapeake are exten- 
sive banks of oyster shells. The Eastern Shore is devoid of coal and iron forma- 
tions and limited in water power, consequently it must remain agricultural. Tra- 
dition and observation maintain that the land is being gradually elevated. 

Maine. — No census. Assessments at least every ten years by mayors, select- 
men and assessors, who note also the males over twenty. Reports upon prisons, 
reform schools, asylums, etc. The third annual report of the geology of Maine 
was published in 1839. 

Massachusetts. — This State is in advance of every other in the extent and ac- 
curacy with which it presses statistical investigations, and is worthy of all praise. 
Nothing is too minute to escape attention, and among her citizens are the first 
statisticians of America. Census every ten years, 1840, 1850, &c; very full: 
taken by assessors of towns. Assessment every ten years, or as often as the Leg- 
islature requires. The last in 1850. Very complete reports are published occa- 
sionally upon industry, manufactures, public health, &c. and annually of birth-. 
marriages and deaths, hospitals, crime, reform schools, prisons, the poor, children 
under fourteen supported by towns, agriculture, education, banks, insurance, rail 
roads, &c. These works are handsomely issued, and are doing much for the ad- 
vancement of statistical knowledge. An invaluable sanitary survey of the State 
has been issued. 

Michigan. — Census every ten years; last in 1854, taken by marshals ap- 
pointed by the Executive in each county. Annual assessments by persons properly 
elected. A manuscript report of survey, by Dr. Houghton, unpublished, is in 
possession of Prof. Douglass, of the medical college of Ann Arbor. 

Missouri. — A census every four years; the last in 1852; cost §7.000. Taken 
by sheriffs. Annual assessments by regularly elected officers. Regular reports of 
deaf and dumb, blind and insane, asylums incorporated, internal improvement 
companies, schools, &c. A geological survey has been ordered but no progress 
made. 

Mississippi. — Census generally every six or eight years; last in 1853. Cost 
three cents per head. Embraced whites, males and females. Total returned 
288,718. Assessment every four years. Number of slaves taxable in 1853, 
303.000. Regular reports from universities, penitentiary, &c. The census taken 
by assessors of counties, includes whole free white. Personal property assessed 
annually. A geological survey is in progress by Prof. Wailes, State Geologist, 
and a report will probably be published soon. 

Minnesota. — Returns of population and militia regularly made bv the assessors 
of taxes. This is general in the Territories, and a census is usual before the for- 
mation of a State government. 

New Hampshire. — No regular census; last in 1783, embracing inhabitants, 
houses, barns and acres of land. School, agricultural and similar reports regu- 
larly. See transactions of the State Agricultural Society. 



26 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

New Jersey. — No State census in tins century. No State taxes assessed. 
County and township taxes assessed by township assessors. Reports on education, 
asylums, &c. Report by H. D. Rogers, State Geologist in 1840. 

New York. — A census every ten years; latest in 1845. Taken by a marshal 
in each election district, which is not to exceed 500 voters. Blanks are furnished 
by the State. Expenses met by the counties. Particulars embraced very minute, 
and more than a hundred in number, to wit : nativities, voters, aliens, foreigners, 
naturalized, unmarried or married, births, deaths, paupers, militia, education, reli- 
gion, manufactures, agriculture, crops and land in cultivation, deaf, dumb, blind, 
&c, occupations, &c. This is the most complete census of any State. The 
assessments of property are annual, and annual reports are made on canals and 
their trade, asylums, railroads, schools, colleges and academies. Geological sur- 
veys of the State have been partially made, and their results published by the 
State Agricultural Society. The legislature has made liberal appropriations for 
general surveys of the State ; scientific men have been engaged to explore the 
field as well as the mine. The State and county agricultural societies, with their 
annual productions, are exciting a happy and noble influence in promoting scien- 
tific and practical agriculture, in the increase of crops, the breeding of stock, the 
drainage of wet lands, the reclamation of barren patches, the general improvement 
of farms, and the development of the mineral resources of the State.* 

North Carolina. — No census taken ; assessments once in ten years of the real 
estate only ; the last nearly ten years ago. A geological report has been pub- 
lished by the State. 

Ohio. — Census every fourth year ; last in 1851, and includes white males 
above twenty-one and white and colored children between five and twenty-one ; 
annual assessments of personal property ; every six years for real ; assessors 
elected in districts, and ascertain yearly the acres in wheat and corn and their 
yield ; regular reports upon benevolent institutions, schools, penitentiaries, &c. 
The whole State, with few exceptions, lies on a substratum of secondary limestone, 
considerable alluvion, lime, sand stone, and much iron. Clays mixed with 
protoxide of iron, potash, and soda, valuable for vegetable productions. The State 
contains great quantities of vegetable mould, and an abundance of limestone. 

Pennsylvania. — No census ever authorized ; assessments triennially for real 
and annually for personal property. The first partial survey of Pennsylvania was 
made in 1836 by Professor Henry D. Rodgers; in 1851 the legislature passed an 
act for the publication of his survey. Some few counties have had surveys made 
independently of the State action. Professor Rodgers' survey was conducted for 
a period of six years, but little progress has been made in the publication of the 
results. 

Rhode Island. — No census ; no county taxes ; the rateable property of the State 
was last estimated in 1849 by a committee of eleven persons. There are regular 
reports upon prisons, schools, banks, railroads, public health, births, marriages, 
and deaths. An effort was made to establish a bureau of statistics. A report upon 
the geology of the State was made by Dr. Charles T. Jackson. See also the 
report of a committee on the Cumberland coal mines. 

South Carolina. — Census every ten years; latest in 1849; number of the white 
inhabitants and the deaf and dumb only taken. Cost, $8,989 for 280,000 people. 
Assessment of personal estate annual, of real, fixed by the legislature and remains 
permanent, the party only determining whether his land be of the first, second, or 
third quality. In regard to geology, an act of the legislature was passed in 1842, 
authorizing the Governor to appoint a person to survey the State. Mr. Rufnn, 
of Virginia, was selected, who commenced the work. His attention was princi- 
pally directed to the extensive marl beds and calcareous deposits abounding 
in the lower portions of the State, and which could be made available for agri- 

* The Industrial Exhibition of New York employed itself in making a collection, under the superintendence 
of Professor Silliman, the leading object of which was to present a geological view of the mineralogical and 
mining wealth of the country, and at the same time to illustrate its geolagy.

cultural purposes. His report was made in 1843. He resigned, and Professor 
Tuoruey was selected to continue the work, his report being published in 1844, 
and a final report in 1848. Nothing of consequence has been done since, except- 
ing the labors of Professor F. S. Holmes in exploring bays, islands, &c. of the 
coast. Fossils collected were to have been published in figure, but were 
omitted. These fossils have since been presented to the Charleston Cabinet of 
Natural History. The valuable Transactions of the State Agricultural Society 
have been published by the legislature. 

Ttxas. — Census by constitution every eight years, embracing all free inhabi- 
tants, and the number of qualified electors ; expense two cents for each white 
inhabitant, and one cent for each slave and free person of color. The latest 
census in 1850, when taken, embraced white males of eighteen and under forty-five, 
children under eighteen and over twelve, over six and under twelve, under six ; 
slaves, colored. Census taken by the regular collectors and assessors of taxes : 
assessments of taxable property annual : annual reports on penitentiary, schools, 
railroads, the attorney general's office, &e. The last legislature established a 
school system, and $2,000,000 United States bonds, together with one-tenth of 
the whole taxation, were set apart for it. 

Tennessee. — Census decennially, qualified voters enumerated ; the latest in 
1851, taken by Commissioners elected for each county. Expense §4,500 for 
150,000 voters ; assessments annually by similar commissioners. Reports are 
made on the penitentiary, lunatic and other asylums, internal improvements, 
geology, banks, &c. every two years. Surveys were made by Dr. Troost, who 
submitted eight or ten partial reports to the legislature. Before his death his 
report was presented to Professors Aggasiz and Hall for revision, and will be 
published by the Smithsonian Institution. [Consult Silusian Basin of Middle 
Tennessee, 1851.] 

Virginia. — Census every fifth year after the national census by the late consti- 
tution. Provision not yet carried into effect. It is to include population and such 
statistics as may be prescribed by law : assessments irregularly for real, and by 
special act for personal property annually ; a permanent rate is fixed for real 
estate : regular reports upon public institutions, internal improvements, and edu- 
cation. A bill is now pending in the legislature for a statistical bureau. Pro- 
fessor Rodgers was engaged several years since to survey the State. He sub- 
mitted annual reports (1836 to 1S41) which are published in the journal of 
the House of Delegates ; he has not issued his final report, the legislature not 
having made an appropriation for its publication. The mineralogy of Virginia is 
receiving some attention from a number of miners, who are examining different 
localities for economic purposes. 

Vermont. — No regular census provided for ; the last was taken in 1771. and 
was but partial. Real estate is appraised every five years by regular appraisers, 
personal every year, including everything but household furniture, fuel, and pro- 
visions necessary for life. Annual reports are made on banks, railroads, asylums, 
prisons, and schools ; the latter suspended during the last two years. Thomp- 
sons Natural History of the State contains a sketch of its geology. Four 
annual reports have been made by Professor Adams, State geologist. Roof- 
ing and writing slate, granite, marble, limestone for quick lime, soapstone, man- 
ganese, &c, are abundant and of fine quality in the State. 

Wisconsin. — Census every ten years from and after 1855 ; the last was taken in 
1848 ; annual assessments, and reports upon deaf and dumb, blind, insane, &c, the 
penitentiary, public schools, &c. For geology of the State, see Owens' Report, 1839, 
1849, 1853, of Iowa. Wisconsin, and 31innesota, published by order of Congress, 
and also Laphanrs Wisconsin. An appropriation for a geological survey was made 
by the legislature in 1852, and Mr. Daniels was appointed to conduct it.*

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 



In a volume little larger than the quarto, and in the same type with this com- 
pendium, it was possible to have embraced the whole material of the census, that 
which has been published, and that which is still buried in the returns together 
with two hundred pages of comparative and illustrative notes. Without such 
notes the tables of a census cannot be understood, or at least, without great labor 
and will often lead even the most careful examiner astray. f 



in 1807 by Mr. McClure. In 1814 De Witt Clinton urged in New York a geological, mineralogical botanical, 
zoological and agricultural survey, the results of which were published in a magnificent series of volumes, at 
the expense of half a million of dollars. North Carolina has the merit of having sent the first geologist into the 
field, I'rof. Olmstead, whose report was prepared in 1825. The subject is now introduced into many of the 
leading colleges, together with that of agricultural chemistry. In addition to the State and Federal Census, the 
larger cities obtain annual or periodical statistics of their population and wealth. In New Orleans there is a 
census of voters every five years, the last being in 1852, which embraced 13,401 names at an expense of $ 2,600. 
The State assessments of real estate are adopted for municipal purposes. Annual reports from the Board of 
Health, from schools, and commercial statistics are very complete. Indianapolis: Census every year by asses- 
sors. Assessments also annual and reports of common schools. Cleveland, latest census in 1853— cost $76.00. 
Total population 31,214. Assessment of personal property annual, real every six years. Augusta, Georgia, 
latest census 1852, cost $200, total population 15,000, particulars embraced, white, colored and slave, male and 
female ; whites between 6 and 15 and 16. Richmond, Va., assessment of real estate every four years, none of 
personal. Wilmington, Del., last census 1853, population 16,163, embraced also statistics of 'manufactures. 
Chicago, census nearly every year, last 1853, taken by special commissioners and embraced dwellings, fami- 
lies, schools, churches, native and foreign, white and colored. Total population 60,652, cost $1,000. Charles- 
ton, S. C, latest census, 1848, two regular assessors; a board in 1854 raised the valuation of real estate to 
f 23,000,000. Statistics of health complete. In 1848 an elaborate statistical volume was published by the city. 
owell, Mass., a census is taken once or twice in ten years, latest in 1850, cost.$150, and included the number 
of families, children between 5 and 15 and foreigners. There are regular reports of births, marriages, &c, and 
of manufactures. Portland, Maine, latest census 1854. New Haven, last* census % 1845, total population 17,674. 
New Haven, Fair Haven and Westville, make up the town of New Haven. Detroit, assessments annual, re- 
ports on education, etc. Milwaulde, Wis.— the board of trade in 1853 published an extended report of com- 
merce and manufactures. Providence, R. I. — Assessment annual, last census 1845. St. Louis. — Census every 
two years, last in 1852, taken by regular assessors and included color, sex, age and school children ; cost $1,000. 
Assessment annual, and full commercial statistics published annually. Baltimore, no city census is taken,; 
regular reports are published upon health and public schools, etc. Cincinnati, no city census except of chil- 
dren. Real estate assessed every six years, personal every year. Board of health and other statistical and com- 
mercial reports annual. Memphis, Tennessee, assessment annual, value of real and personal estate 1854, 
$7,116,500. Last census 1854, total population 12,687 persons. Annual reports on education, etc. 

The above are all the replies that were received to a circular from the office. Of the larger cities omitted it 
may be asserted that their statistics are equally full. In Boston the statistical reports are frequent and thorough 
and the census descends into numerous and important details. That of 1850 was especially complete. The 
census of Boston, published in 1846 by Mr. Shattuck, by public authority, was an invaluable statistical docu- 
ment. In New York a statistical bureau has been established ; and reports upon population, health, industry, 
education, etc., are issued, which are worthy of imitation every where. The city of Philadelphia has lately 
provided for a report upon its manufactures. Its health reports are annual. 

t A plan, something like the following, would have presented the greatest advantages, though a great deal of 
discretion must necessarily be allowed to the head of the office. 

I. Sub-Divisions of Counties Alphabetically— Population, white, free eolored and slave, (disregarding age or 
sex,) of every place whatever, found in the schedules. 

II. Counties alphabetically — The total population of each county at every census from 1790 with the date 
of formation. 

III. Counties — Statistics of every county in 1850 precisely as published in this Compendium, adding the 
deaf and dumb, &c, births, marriages, deaths, and real and personal estate. 

IV. Counties — Detailed population of counties in 1850.

Divided into males and 
females, and into the 
a<res as now classified. 



V. Towns and Cities Alphabetically — Of over 2,000 population, each arranged as the counties in No. IV. 

VI. Cities — Of over 10,000 with occupations, specific nativities, houses with one family; one to two, two 
to five families, &c. 

VII. Cities — Of over 10,000 by every census, white, colored and slave, male and female. 

VIII. *States — Population of States and Territories at each census, white, colored and slave, male and female. 

IX. States — Population of States and Territories between certain ages, as under 15 ; 15 and 30 ; 30 and 
45 ; 45 and 60 ; and over 60. 

X. States — Considered as in Table IV. 

XI. States — Occupations in each State. 

XII. States — Specific nalivities of the population of each State. 

XIII. States— Statistics of each with more full particulars of education, newspapers, libraries, real es.tate 
holders, persons occupying under five acres, 5 to 20; 20 to 50; 50 to 100, &c; producing under and over certain 
quantities of leading crops ; natives and foreigners, white, blacks and mulattoes, holding real estate, &c. 

XIV. United States— Specific ages of the population of the United States in the aggregate, as of 1 year, 
two years, &c, to the highest ages. They should be taken from the returns, in this manner. 

XV. United States— Aggregate Statistics of the United States combined as in this compendium, with 
Statistics of States and Sections and Cities, upon such points as have not yet been aggregated from the 
returns, except in a few particular cases. Ratio tables. 

Appendix I.— Manufacturing Statistics of each county and large town, as they are prepared in the office. 

Appendix II.— Mortality tables, condensed upon the plan of the Massachusetts Reports by Counties and towns. 

The States should be printed as in the Compendium, alphabetically, thouirh prepared in the order of Sections, 
each Section being added and the results appended at the foot of the Table. Thus, New England, etc., 
slaveholding States, non-slaveholding, etc. The Tables c-an then be cut up and pasted in the alphabetical 
order. The work should be illustrated by diagrams. 

General Notes.— The U. S. marshals, the governors of territories and assistants under them have always been 
employed. The district of each enumerator in the last census was not to exceed,when practicable, 20,000 persons. 

The marshals have alwavs received a fixed compensation, varying from $100 to $2,500 or $3,000, and the 
assistants from 1 to 2 cents for each inhabitant enumerated, with an increase in the way of mileage in sparsely

settled neighborhoods. The mileage by the last census was fixed at 10 cents per mile, to be ascertained by 
multiplying the square root of the number of houses visited by the square root of the number of miles in the 
district. For each inhabitant 2 cents were allowed, for each death 2 cents, each farm 10 cents, each manufac- 
turing establishment 15 cents. For social statistic:- 2 per cent, on the earniugs for population! For copies 8 
cents'per page. An addition of 100 per cent, was allowed California. The mileage rule in 1850 came as near 
expressing the number of miles travelled as any which could be devised. If the district embraced 100 square 
miles and the number of dwellings was 10,000. the result would be expressed by 10^100=1,000. In other 
words it was assumed that the district would have been traversed ten times in order to call at every house, 
which would be very nearly the fact. The clerical duties previous to 1850 were for the most part performed 
by marshals and their assistants. Accuracy has in general beeu secured by the oaths of these officers and by 
the penalties affixed. Parties were also compelled to answer under penalty. The returns are required to be 
exposed for inspection and the originals in 1550 were to be deposited in the county court, one copy to be sent 
to the Secretary of State at home, and one to the Secretary of the Interior. It is now provided that future 
census enumerations shall follow that of 1550 if no other law be passed, and a permanent system of represen- 
tative numbers has been adopted, as will be seen in another place. The Secretary is also authorized to order 
a new census hereafter in any instance where there is a failure of returns.

The preceding table, will show the expense incurred upon each national census in the aszregzte and to the 
individual, ft has reference to the whole amount expended, inclusive of printing and binding, except for the 
census of 1850. The cost of printing and binding in 1540 reached -8154.629. Jt is not yet ascertained for the 
present census. The amounts in the large table are exclusively of office work, which in 1540 cost but about 
g 10,000 and in 1850 over 5300.000. In the former instance the marshals performed the most of such labors 
which was taken into consideration in their pay. and in the latter instance they performed very little. The 
cost to each individual may be compared with that incurred by the States and cities for their own enumer- 
ations as shn\\-?_ when upon those subjects. 

The schedules of the United States census, 1850. embraced about 640.000 medium pages, and will make 80*3 
or 1.000 volumes. Those of 1540 are bound in 350 volumes: those of 1830 in 150 volumes/ The earlier sche- 
dules are unbound. Three thousand reams of blanks were sent out by express in 1650. and returned by mail 
between the 29th August, 1850. and 17th February, 1852. The weight in tons was one hundred. They were 
uninjured, except a few in California destroyed by fire. In 1640 a'million of blanks were distributed! The 
number of marshals in 1850 was 45. assistants 3.231. In 1840 marshals and assistants 2.057. Whenever the 
schedules were incomplete the assistants were written to and part of their pay retained until the corrections 
were made if important. The principle should be more stringently adhered to hereafter.'

STATISTICAL VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES, 

BASED UPON THE SEVERAL OFFICIAL RETURNS, FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD, 



AND EMBRACING A 



COMPENDIUM OF THE CENSUS OF 1850. 



The subjects to be illustrated and discussed in the present volume admit of the following 
convenient distribution : 

L Territory. 

II. Population. 

III. Moral and Social Condition. 

IV. Industry. 

V. Property, Revenue, Taxation, etc 

VL Statistical Detail op Cities, Towns and Counties, 

I. Territory, embracing a comparison of States with each other and with the Union, the 
area of the United States at the several Census periods, the geographical distribution of 
areas, etc. 

II. Population, considered as 

White. 

Free Colored. 

Slave. 

Aggregate. 
The facts for the several subdivisions or chapters of population, whether considered as 
native or foreign born, will be treated in the following order, combined in each particular 
with appropriate ratio and comparative tables. 

1. Aggregrate Number. 5. Births, Marriages and Deaths. 

2. Families and Dwellings. 6. Deaf and Dumb, Blind, Insane, &c. 

3. Sex. "7. Occupations. 

4. Age. 8. Nativities. 

The free colored and slaves, wherever practicable, will be separated into 1st, Black ; and 
2d, Mixed or Mulatto ; and a table of Indian population at several periods, will be added. 

III. Yg VI. These heads sufficiently explain themselves. 

IV. Industry, including 

1. Agriculture, f 

2. Manufactures! 

3. Commerce. 

4. Internal Improvements. 

The separate consideration of each of the classes which make up the population of the 
United States, is indispensable to any correct statistical reasonings in regard to it, and 
should be as far as possible secured in the tables of every Census. No set of truths can be 
applicable alike to classes so differently situated and of such distinct organization. How 
these classes compare with reference to the family relation and to the occupancy of dwell- 
ings, with reference to the predominance of the male or the female, with reference to age 
or to vital and industrial power, what are the ratios of births to marriages and deaths, how 
the people are employed, are they of native or foreign extraction, are they born in the State 
of residence or in some other of the States, — these are all questions of vital importance to the 
socialist who would reform abuses — to the moralist who would trace the sources of vice, to 
the economist who would develop those of wealth and power, to the physician laboring in the 
cause of science, and to the statesman legislating soundly for the present and the future.

PART I. 
TERRITORY. 

The territorial limits of the United States include that portion of the continent of North 
America, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, which is bounded by the British 
possessions on the North, and by the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Republic on the South. 

The superficial area of the Union, according to a computation made by the Topographical 
Bureau at the close of 1853, and subsequently reviewed and amended, amounted on the first 
of January, 1854, to two millions nine hundred and thirty-six thousand, one hundred and sixty-six 
square miles, being somewhat more than one-third of the area of the continent of North 
America. 

The treaty of 1S54 with Mexico settles the boundaries of the two republics as follows. K Retaining the 
Ktrae dividing line between the two Califomias a* already denned and established according to the 5th article 
of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the limi;s between the two Republics shall be as follows: Beginning in 
the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land, opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, as provided in the 5th 
article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; thence, as defined in the said article up the middle of that 
river to the point where the parallel of 31 deg. 47 min, north latitude crosses the same ; thence due west one 
hundred miles ; thence south to the parallel of 31 deg. 90 min. north latitude ; thence along the said parallel of 
XI deg. 20 min. to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich ; thence in a straight line to a point on 
the Colorado river, twenty English miles below the junction of the Giia and Colorado rivers ; thence up tlie 
middle of the said river Colorado, until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico.-"'

j According to Balbrs estimate of the area of North America. Another estimate gives New Britain but 
1,300.000 square miles. 

} McCulloch. The late Canadian census gives 242,482 square miles as the area over which jurisdiction is 
actually extended. 

1| Gufbert gives 962.500 kilometres carres, or 371.611 square miles. 

$ Greenland from present information would appear to be a trilateral island, 1,500 miles long and 600 miles in 
trs greatest breadth. Its area, therefore, cannot be greater than we state above. Guibert gives the area of Dan 
Lsh America 3.S61 square miles, and McCulloch only 170. meaning only that portion which has been explored. 
The area of the continent of North America is variously estimated by geographers at from five to seven 



millions of square miles. Guyot (•• Earth and Man ■"-") estimates it at 5.472.000, and that of Europe at 2.688,000, 
exclusively of islands. The following tables have been carefully compiled from the latest mfkial sources. 
Where these were wanting recourse has been had to Guibert (••Dictionnaire G-eop-aphiquc.'-) and the Go'.iia 
^-ihnamzch." In the quarto volume of the Census the figures for Europe were entirely adopted from McCul- 
loch, and differ in several particulars as well as in the aggregate from those which are now given. It is need- 
less to say that exactness cannot be expected in such calculations, but only the best approximation.

The limits of the United States when their independence was achieved (1783) did not ex- 
ceed 820,680 square miles. Louisiana, purchased from France in 1803, and Florida from 
Spain in 1819, added respectively an extent of 899,5*79 and 66,900 square miles. In 1842 and 
1846 the Northern boundary was settled by treaties with Great Britain, confirming the rights 
of the United States to 308,052 square miles, included in the Territory of Oregon, &c. In 1846 
Texas was annexed, with an area of 318,000 square miles, and by a. treaty soon afterwards 
with Mexico an area of 522,955 additional square miles was incorporated. Thus did the ter- 
ritory of the United States double itself in the first twenty years of its existence, and thus has 
it increased over three-fold in less than sixty years. The figures are given upon the authority 
of a statement prepared at the Topographical Bureau for the Census office, and annexed. The 
new treaty with Mexico, if ratified by the Senate, will add a fraction more and swell the 
aggregate to about 3,000,000 square miles.*

The territorial extent of the Republic is, therefore, nearly ten times as large as that of Gfreat 
Britain and France combined ; three times as large as the whole of France, Britain, Austria, 
Prussia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Holland, and Denmark, together ; one-and-a-half times as 
large as the Russian empire in Europe ; one-sixth less only than the area covered by the fifty- 
nine or sixty empires, states, and Republics of Europe ; of equal extent with the Roman em- 
pire, or that of Alexander, neither of which is said to have exceeded 3,000,000 square miles. [| 

Considered in lesser divisions, the calculations of the Topographical Bureau show the exist- 
ence of an interior valley drained by the waters of the Mississippi and its tributaries, nearly as 
large as the slopes of the Pacific and Atlantic proper together, and one-third larger than the 
whole domain of the Republic upon the adoption of the present Constitution, ( 1*7 89.) 



* The treaty has been ratified but with a reduction of the contemplated area to 27,500 square miles, making 
the total area of the Union July 1st, 1854, 2,963,666 square miles. 

t These estimates are lower than those usually made. Morse, in his Gazetteer estimates the area of the 
Union in 1783 at 1,000,000 square miles, and Major Stoddard, avho took possession of Louisiana under the 
treaty and prepared a very valuable history of it, considers the area to be 1,307,260. Theso, of course, were but 
vague estimates, subject to after correction. Again, Oregon has generally been estimated at 341,463, Texas 
402,907, California 448,691. Dc Bow's Industrial Resources, Vol. 3, Art. U. S.

Thus, over two-fifths of the national territory is drained by the Mississippi and its tribu- 
taries, and more than one-half is embraced in what may be called its Middle Region. One- 
fourth of this total area belongs to the Pacifie. cne-sixth to the Atlantic proper, one-twenty- 
eixth to the Lakes, one-ninth to the Gulf, or one-third to the Atlantic, including the Lakes 
and the Gulf.* 

A calculation made at the office of the Coast Survey in 1853, gives for the total main shore 
line of the United States, (exclusively of bays, sounds, islands, src.) 12.609 statute miles. If 
all of these be followed, and the rivers entered to the- head of tide water, the total shore line 
-will be swelled to 33,069 miles.

scribed from the forks of the Kansas river, west of Missouri, will touch New Orleans and Galveston, or the 
Gulf frontier, and the 49th parallel of latitude, our northern boundary, making these points equidistant 
from the centre. On a larger circle, with the same centre, the points of equidistance will be San Fran- 
cisco, in. California, Fort Vancouver on the Columbia, in Oregon. Quebec and Boston upon the Atlantic. 
Hudson's Bay on the extreme north, and Havana, Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico on the extreme 
south. The various great basins, declivities and table lands on the continent he estimates as follows : Missis- 
sippi basin 1.123.100 square miles; St. Lawrence 475,400; Hudson's Bay 1.077.200 ; Mackenzie basin 898.500 ; 
Pacific declivity 420,000: Atlantic declivity 270,700 square miles. 

Mr. Darby, in his '-'Geographical Dictionary." gives the followine aesresates: Valley of the Ohio 200.000 
square miles; Vallev of the Mississippi proper'180.000; Vallev of the Missouri 500.000; and the Vallev of the 
Lower Mississippi 330,000 : total 1,210,000 square miles. 

Lieut. Maury compares the basins of the Old World with those which are drained into the Gulf of Mexico 
and Caribbean seas.

Lieut. Maury remarks "the area of all the valleys which are drained by the rivers of Europe which empty 
into the Atlantic, ail the valleys that are drained by the rivers of Asia which empty into the Indian ocean, and 
of all the valleys that are drained by the rivers of Africa and Europe which empty into the Mediterranean, does 
not cover an extent of territory as great as that included in the valleys drained by the American rivers alone, 
which discharge themselves into one central sea." 

Dr. Patterson, of Philadelphia, made the centre of representative population of the Union in 1840 in the north- 
western extremity of Virginia, and states that it had travelled westward since 1790, when it was in Baltimore 
countv, Md., 182 miles in verv nearlv the same parallel of latitude.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



The mam shore line of the Atlantic including Bays, &c, is twice that of the Gulf, three 
times that of the Pacific and more than equal to that of the Pacific and Gulf combined. The 
Southern States have three times as much sea coast as the Northern. 

The extent of shore line is an important element in determining the commercial character 
of a nation. In this regard Europe is more favored than any other portion of the earth, and 
North America next; the former having, according to Guyot ("Earth and Man") only 156 
miles, and the latter 228 miles of surface to one mile of coast (the United States having 241) 
whilst South America has 31Q, Africa 623 and Asia 459 miles. 

The table which follows furnishes three measurements, viz: 

1st. The Coast Line, i. e. sea coast, bays, islands, &c, " as if an adometer wheel were passed over the high 

water line," and the results are for the Atlantic coast 12,359 miles. 

The rivers to head of tide have not been measured, but from a former table the length total 

is both shores 6,655 " 

For the Gulf of Mexico, the coastline is 5,744 " 

Length of rivers to head of tide, from same table 3, 846 " 

2d. Coast line, exclusive oj islantls and rivers to head of tide. 

For the Atlantic 6, 017 «

3d. Coast line, exclusive of bays, islands, &c, &c, except Massachusetts bay — Atlantic 2, 163 "

These results are somewhat greater than those of Table V., and are believed to be nearer 
the truth by the amount of the difference.

The citizen of the United States arriving at Xew Orleans from Xew York has passed over a 
distance more than equal to that separating London from Constantinople, or Paris from St 
Petersburg. If be has taken the land route to Astoria his travel will be nearly as great as 
from Xew York to Bremen; if the water route, he will have made a voyage nearly equal to 
one from London to Canton. 

The United States consist at the present time (1st July 1854,) of thirty-one independent States 
and nine Territories, including the District of Columbia, whose areas will be found in the 
table annexed, prepared at the Topographical Bureau. It is the only official statement. 
There were, in IS 50, sixteen hundred and twenty county divisions included within the organ- 
ized States and Territories, but it is impossible to give any satisfactory statement of their 
areas. By reference to the statistical tables of these counties at the end of the volume, it will 
be found how liable thev are to changes, and also what changes were actually effected between 
1840 and 1850.

Note. — The following statement of the river navigation and shore line of the United States was prepared by 
Colonel Abert, of the Topographical Engineers, at the request of the Treasury Department, December 7th, 
1845. It has since been completed to date. The head of tide-water is assumed as the limit of steam naviga- 
tion, as impeding falls or rapids are encountered at that point, above which many rivers are adapted to steam 
navigation, but to what extent is not sufficiently known. The shore line of rivers to head of tide-water &om 

Maine to Texas is 10. 501 miles.

The States and the Territories have, at the present time, about an equal area. The slave- 
holding States have 851,508 square miles, and the non-slaveholding States, 612,59?;. There 
are 865,57:6 square miles east of the Mississippi, 2,0*70,590 west, 1,200,381 intermediate between 
the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains, and 87/0,209 west of the Rocky Mountains. North 
of the old Missouri compromise line, there is an area of 1,97/0,07/7; square miles, and 966,089 
south of it. 



* Some of the areas in this table will be found to differ very materially from those published in the quarto 
census, page xxxiii. They were made up in that instance from previous census publications and from the re- 
ports of the General Land Office. As no two statements hitherto made in geographies, gazetteers, etc., can be 
found to agree, it seemed fit to have the whole matter referred to a proper and competent authority for set 
tlement, and none could be more so than the U. S. Topographical Bureau. Col. Abert, the head of that de- 
partment was kind enough to have all of the computations made from the map of Colton, (1844) and from the 
Topographical Bureau map of the country west of the Mississippi; and, in a note of June 7th, 1854, says : 
'■'• You will perceive the total area is still less than that formerly sent from this office. As these results are ne- 
cessarily approximate, it is not to be expected from the imperfections of the maps, that the same results pre- 
cisely will be arrived at by different persons and methods. The discrepancy between the total here given for 
the States, and that of table XII. of tbe quarto census, (made up from the popular sources of information,) is 
ninpipally in the following. The Indian Territory is there given, 187,171, Nebraska, 136,700, North-west 
Territory, 528,725. Total, 852,596, instead of 521,807 in the present table. Are not the two first included in 
tire third in table XII ?" 

The areas for California, Texas and the Territories west of the Mississippi were computed for Table XII. of 
the quarto census, from DisturnelPs map, commonly known as the "Treaty Map." Since the publication of 
that of the Topographical Bureau, the other is deemed valueless, and the discrepancies, though great, will 
illustrate the comparative accuracy of the two authorities. 

f And District of Columbia. 



COLONIAL POPULATION. 37 

There are six States and Territories larger, as large or a little less only than that of either 
of the powers of France, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia. Spain or Turkey. Eight of the 
largest States have an area as large as the remaining twenty-three States. Whilst the New 
England States hare about one-fortieth of our territory, the Middle States have one-twenty - 
fifth. the Southern States one-eleventh, the North-western, one-seventh, and the South-western 
one-sixth, in round numbers. As these great divisions will be frequently referred to in this 
volume, and tables will be presented in regard to them, it is proper to explain* (see 
note) what they are always intended to embrace, unless the contrary be expressly stated. 

Now that the States and Territories have increased and are increasing so greatly in num- 
ber, difficulties of arrangement continually occur, and it is almost impracticable to adopt any 
which will be convenient for reference, easy of designation, and readily suggestive of contrasts 
and comparisons. For all of the detailed tables in this work, it has been deemed best to 
follow the alphabetical order of arrangement, except for the Territories, instead of the method 
by geographical position or by the date of admission into the Union. These last methods 
are complex and embarrassing, and ought to be abandoned. Where the object is a classificar 
Hon of States geographically, the methods in use are equally at fault Thus, Kentucky and 
Missouri are forcibly separated from Tennessee and Arkansas, and thrown with the North- 
west to be associated with California and with Oregon and the other Territories. Maryland 
and the District of Columbia are combined with Pennsylvania and New York to form the 
Northern or Middle States, though in fact they belong to the South. Other difficulties may 
be stated, and they will increase with the settlement of the country. Cannot some method be 
proposed, which, whilst it shall not obliterate the old distinctions now so much in use, will 
admit as elements of classification the great geographical divisions of the country, the Lakes, 
the Valley, the Gulf, the Atlantic, the Pacific, and also such as are political or social, as States 
or Territories, slaveholding or non-slaveholding States, <fcc ? After some reflection, and not 
a few abortive efforts, the arrangement on page 38 is suggested, which, it is believed, will 
combine all the proposed advantages, and be of very simple comprehension and reference. 



PART II. 

POPULATION. 

CHAPTER I.— COLONIAL POPULATION. 

There was no general enumeration of the people of the United States earlier than the census 
of 1790, although conjectural estimates of population, more or less accurate, are to be found 
among the records of the colonial period, and are valuable in the absence of other material. 
Several of these are annexed. Upon the basis of the increase which was afterwards ascer- 
tained, (viz: for the colored population between 1Y90 and 1800, being at that time least dis- 
turbed by immigration.) the total population in 1775 would have been 3.490,740, including 
479.155 slaves, the population in 1749, 1.467,539, including 261,833 slaves; the population in 
1701, 390,299. But this mode of calculation would be very fallacious for extremely early 
periods.y

f In 1775 Congress recommended the several Assemblies of the Colonies to ascertain the number of thf ir 
inhabitants. In 1782 the journals state that '* such enumerations have not been made." The recommenda- 
tion was repeated in 17S3, but a committee declared in £765 that they could not ascertain how many of the 
States had complied. The estimates in the text are taken from Holmes' Annals. In the documents of the 
Congress of 1775, the estimate reaches 3,000.000. Holmes says that Dr. Humphreys, in his " Historical Ac- 
count of the Society for the promulgation of the Gospel," is authority for the figures in the column of 1701, 
but that Dr. Stiles had assigned them specifically to that year. Beverly gives to Virginia, in 1704, 60,000 souls. 
In 1755. the population of Massachusetts was estimated at 234.000 : that of Connecticut, at 133,000 ; of Rhode 
Island at 35.929 ; of New Hampshire at 34.000. Connecticut, in 1756. contained 126.212 whites, and 3.5t7 
Macks; in 1774,191.392 whites and 6,464 blacks. Rhode Island, in 1748, contained 29.755 whites, and 4,373 
blacks. Maryland, in 1755, contained 107,208 souls, including 3.592 mulattoes. and 42,764 negroes. The es- 
timates in the tables for the colonies in 1701 and 1749, inelude generally, it is believed, all classes. In South 
Carolina, however, in 1701. the negroes are omitted. Dr. Shaftuck gives Boston (in 1742) 16,382 inhabitants, 
including 1,374 colored, of whom, in 1754, 989 were slaves. In 1765 the total colored population was 81L

At the beginning of the revolution the Southern colonies had therefore 812,000 white in- 
habitants, and the Northern 1,491,000. Connecticut was the fourth State in rank. Massachu- 
setts and Pennsylvania were each a third larger than New York, which was even excelled by 
Connecticut. 

Upon the adoption of the Federal Government in 1739, framed upon the basis of popular 
representation, more precise and accurate knowledge in regard to the numbers of the people 
became necessary, and such knowledge is accordingly provided for in the Second Section of 
the first Article of the Constitution.* 

" Representatives and taxation shall be apportioned among the several States which maybe included within 
this Union, according to their representative numbers, which shall be determined by adding (o the whole 
number of free persons (including those bound to service for a term of years and excluding Indians not taxed) 
three-fifths of all other persons/' (meaning slaves.) 



CHAPTER II.— POPULATION OF TE1? UNITED STATES.

and aggregate results of which are as follows :

At the close of 1854 the total population of the United States, upon the supposition that its 
average ratio of increase has been maintained, or nearly so, mav be stated in round numbers 
at 28.500,000. 

The present population of the Union may be said to consist of, first — the number who 
were in the country on the formation of the government in 1789, and their descendants; 
second, of those who have come into the country singe that period by immigration, and their 
descendants, (of this class much will be said under the head of "Nativities;") third, of those 
who have been brought in by annexation, as in Louisiana, Florida, New Mexico, etc., and their 
descendants. It is sufficient to say of the last class, that Louisiana, when purchased, had 
77,000 inhabitants, including 53,000 slaves; Florida about 10,000; California and New Mexico, 
about 60,000; and that Texas and Oregon only brought back into the Union citizens who 
had emigrated thither but a short time before. The number of Indians (taxed) domesticated 
and absorbed in the population, cannot be ascertained. The colonial population was swelled, 
in 1765, by the extension of the boundary to the Mississippi, and the introduction of 2.000 
French residents of the territory incorporated. (Bancroft.!) 

* See Introductory Chapter. 

f Dr. Dowler, of \ T ew Orleans, a profound vital statistician, in a pamphlet upon the influence of republican 
government upon the extension of population, after showing an extraordinary decline in most of the Cities, 
States, and Towns of South and Central America and Mexico, remarks that ; ' in three centuries the entire 
Caucasian race in both Americas south of the United States, has not equalled numerically that portion of the 
Union lying west of the Alleghany mountains, settled by the present generation, amid the conflicts of prolonged 
savage wars with the bravest and most sanguinary nations known in all history."

a Deducted to make the totals published incorrectly in those years, b Persons on board vessels of war in the 
United States naval service, c A later statement from the State Department for the same year, gave Ala- 
bama a total of 144,317. 

•*Bythe State Census of Missouri, in 1848, there were 510,435 whites; 1,779 free colored; 76,757 slaves 
total, 588,971. By the census of 1852, there were 623,319 whites ; 2,526 free colored ; and 87,172 slaves ; totals 
713,017. By the State Census of Louisiana there were in 1847,196,430 whites; free colored 19,842; slaves, 
211,483; total, 427,755; and in 1852, 301,103 whites ; 23,820 free colored; 261,692 slaves; total, 585,312. By 
the Census of New York, in 1845, there were 2,560,149 whites, and 44,346 colored ; total, 2,604,495. By the 
Alabama State Census of 1850, there were 434,392 whites, 2,491 free colored, and 340,048 slaves ; total 776,931. 
By the Massachusetts State Census of 1850, the total population was 973,715. The population of California, 
according to the State Census of 1852, [ordered to be made part of the Census by Congress] was 224,435. [See 
table near the end of the volume.] The population of Wisconsin in 1836 was 11,683; in 1838,18,130; in 
1842, 44,478; in 1847, 210,546. The white population of South Carolina, by the State Census of 1849, was 
280,385. 

Much interesting detail, not now published, could be gleaned from the national Census, such as should re- 
ceive attention at future periods. For example, a hasty view of the returns from three or four States shows : 
one white person in Cole county, Missouri, pauper, and one in Schuyler county, both females, aged 110 each. 
In Indiana, one female, black, in Hendricks county, born in Virginia, and a female, black, in Perry county, 
each aged 113; and another in Wayne county, also born in Virginia, aged 104. In Colleton District, S. C, a 
female black, aged 111. In Lincoln county, Geo., a blind male white, aged 108; and in Wilkinson county, 
same State, a female white aged 105. In the parish of Lafayette, La., one female black slave aged 130, not 
infirm. In North Carolina three male whites aged respectively 108, 110 and 111 ; two white females aged each 
106; one, 108; one, 114; ono mulatto male, 106; one mulatto male 120; one black male, 109; one female 
black, 115 ; two black females, 110 ; one black female, 111 ; one mulatto female, 100 ; one Indian male, 125; 
one Indian female, 140. In Fountain county, Indiana, there is a family, four members of which are deaf and 
dumb; in Greene county, same State, another with five; in Howard county, twins deaf and dumb. In 
Marshall county, Indiana, there is a family with three boys, now thirteen years old, born at one birth ; one of 
whom is blind. [The Prussian Statistics show in 23 years, 1,689 cases of three children at a birth, and 36 
cases of fovrr children ; the males always preponderating.] Four out of five in a family in Weymouth, Mass., 
are deaf and dumb. Three children in one family in North BrooKfield, are deaf and dumb. In Boston, Mass., 
there is a female who was a mother at eleven years of age, and in 1850 was 25 years old, and had five children 
living. 






POPULATION OF GREAT DIVISIONS— DENSITY. 



41 



It appears from table XII. that although the density of population in all of the States 
and Territories which were organized in 1840, has increased since that time, yet in conse- 
quence of the introduction of new territory, the density of population in the Union at large, 
has declined from 9.55 persons to a square mile, which it was in 1340 to T.90 in 1850. A 
similar decline, and for the same reason, is noticed in 1810 and 1820, from the density of 
1800. Although the population of the United States has increased six fold since 1790, the 
number of persons to a square mile of its territory has not doubled. (See Part I.)

The population of the United States on the first of June, 1850. was twenty -three millions 
one hundred and ninety-one thousand eight hundred and seventy-sis persons, of whom, as 
will be hereafter seen, nineteen millions five hundred and fifty three thousand and sixty-eight 
were white, four hundred and thirty-four thousand four hundred and ninety-five were free 
colored, and three millions two hundred and four thousand three hundred and thirteen were 
slaves. If to this number be added those who possibly escaped the enumerators from being 
temporarily abroad or travelling in the country at the time, and were not reported, (those on 
their way to California were considered as already there.) as belonging to any household, or 
who were not sleeping in any dwelling house or out house visited — the total number may be 
safely set down at twenty-three millions two hundred and fifty thousand persons.* There 
were" at that period within the jurisdiction of the Union, (see table hereafter,) four hundred 
thousand seven hundred and sixty-four unrepresented and untaxed Indians, swelling the aggre- 
gate population under the jurisdiction of the republic in 1850, to twenty-three millions six hun- 
dred and fifty thousand seven hundred, and sixty-four persons.

By the above table it appears that, whilst the Atlantic States have increased more than 
three-fold since 1790, the Gulf States, which had then scarcely any existence, have now a 
population nearly one-half as great as the population of all the States together at that time 



* The assistant Marshals were ordered to visit every description of house ; to enumerate persons temporarily 
absent, to include those alive on the first of June, although dead at the time of their visit, and to omit all the 
living who were born since the first of June. Thus sailors abroad and travellers belonging to the country, 
were" to be included, and the assistants were required to enter from the registers at seaports, Mariners not 
already enumerated in families. Persons on board every description of vessel were to be taken, unless tem- 
porarily or accidentally in the country, and not belonging to it. 

The English Census of 1851 gives a total of 82.921 persons not sleeping in houses at the time the census was 
taken, to wit, 12,924 sleep in barges, 9,972 in barns. 8,277 in tents and open air, 8,575 in vessels in port 
engaged in inland navigation, 43,173 in sea-going vessels in port. The total number of sailors in tha Ameri- 
can merchant marine may be estimated in 1853, at about 112,500. In the United States navy, the number 
of seamen at the period of the census of 1850, was 7.500. of whom about 6,638 were then out of the country, 
and of the total number, about 1,360 were of foreign birth, [from a statement prepared for this office 
by the Secretary of the Navy], a similar report from the War Department, shows the number of the army, 
1st June 1850, officers and men, 10,540. two-thirds of the latter or about 7,025 being foreign born. The 
number of men in the army, navy, &c. of Great Britain in 1853. was 210,474. The number of merchant sea- 
men at home and abroad, 124,744. total, 335,218; of the 225,916 abroad, 13,722 were of colonial or foreign birth. 
The number of British subjects other than mariners in foreign states, was ascertained in 1851 through the State 
Department to be 33.775. exclusively of those in other places not ascertained, to wit. in Grp°ce. 1.068. Russia, 
2,783.Sardinia. 1.069. Turkey, 611, Two Sicilies, 1.414. China.649. Persia. 33. Alexandria, loo. Cairo. 85,' Tripoli, 
23, Belgium, 3,828, France, 20.357, Saxony, 321, Turkey in Asia, 624, Mexico, 755. fcc. It would be well for 
the government of the United States in a similar manner through hs consuls and ministers, to obtain this infor- 
mation in regard to its citizens at each census or oftener. At present the number of citizens residing 
abroad cannot be conjectured unless from the number of native passengers annually returning to the country. 
It is said that 700 to 1.000 are now residents of Paris. The total number abroad may be supposed at least as 
large as that of foreigners in the country who are merely passing through it without the intention of remaining, and 
no doubt it is many times larger. Such foreigners, however, under the instructions to Marshals, would not 
be enumerated in our schedules. The whole number of foreigners temporarily in Great Britain is not known, 
though the annual number entering the country did not exceed before 1850, an average of 18.000, swelled in 
1651 in consequence of the Great Fail, to 65,233.

The Middle States are therefore the densest portion of the Union, owing, in some degree, to 
the very large cities existing there. The New England States come next in order ; then the 
North-west; then the South, and lastly the South-west. The non-slaveholding States are 
twice as dense as the slaveholding States. The States, taken together, have a density of about 
sixteen to the square mile. Excluding Texas and California, their density is over twenty-one 
to the square mile. The Territories have one inhabitant only to every sixteen square miles. 
Texas and California together have less than one to a square mile. Whilst nearly twenty-five 
persons inhabit a square mile in the region east of the Mississippi, and nearly twenty persons 
in the Atlantic slope, in the Mississippi valley there are only about seven persons to the square 
mile ; west of the Mississippi, less than one person to the square mile ; on the Pacific slope, 
one person to every six square miles ! With the density of the Mississippi valley the United 
States would have had but 21,000,000 inhabitants ; with the density of the Southern States, 
the number would be nearly 45,000,000 ; with the density of New England, 123,000,000; and 
with the density of the Middle States, 1^0,000,000* 

The density of Switzerland approximates nearer than that of any of the countries named in 
the note to the density of Massachusetts, although still at a large remove. Belgium, the 
highest on the list, is more than three times as dense as Massachusetts, and nearly ten times as 
dense as New England. Great Britain is denser than France ; and Holland, denser than either, 
having twice the density of Massachusetts. Brazil, Mexico and Canada are much less dense 
than the United States. With the density of Sweden and Norway, the least populous of any 
European States, the United States would embrace forty-five millions of inhabitants; with 
the density of Russia, over eighty millions ; with that of Spain, two hundred millions ; of 
France, five hundred millions ; of Britain, six hundred and sixty millions ; of Belgium eleven 
hundred and fifty millions. Twelve times the number of persons now live to the east of 
the Mississippi as live to the west of it. The non-slaveholding have a third greater popula- 
tion than the slaveholding States. The South has more than the South-west. The Middle 
States have as much as the Southern, and New England or South-western together, and a 
little more than the North-west. 

The number of representatives assigned to each of the States in the lower House of Con- 
gress under the several enumerations, and those that were assigned prior to the first census, 
together with other facts relating to the origin of States and Territories, are condensed into 
the table which follows. To understand it fully will require a reference to other pages of the 
volume in which the population is exhibited by classes.

* Admitted into the Union after the apportionment under which they are here arranged was made, but De- 
fore the succeeding census. 

f The whole of the thirteen "original States" were settled in the period of one hundred and twenty-five 
years, which intervened between the landing at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, and the arrival of Oglethorpe in 
: ; gia in 1733. Meanwhile Henry Hudson had come to New York [1609]; the Mayflower's "colony had 
landed in Massachusetts [1620] ; John Mason had received a grant of New Hampshire in the same year ; a pa- 
tent had issued for Connecticut [1631] ; religious differences in Massachusetts had sent settlers to Rhode Island ; 
a title to Maryland had vested in Lord Baltimore [1632]: a cession of Delaware was obtained from the Indians 
[1640] : the Carolinas had passed into the possession of Clarendon and others, were settled in 1667 or 1663, and 
divided in two in 1729; and New Jersey had been patented in 1664. During the revolution, and afterwards, 
Congress held its sessions in Philadelphia. Baltimore, New York, Lancaster, York, Princeton. Annapolis and 
T iton. Havins been interrupted at Philadelphia the sessions were removed to the halls of the college at Prince- 
ton. In 1784 commissioners were appointed to procure a site for the Capitol, between two or three miles square, 
upon the Delaware river, and erect suitable buildings, but nothing was done by them. In 1789 a bill passed one 
House of Congress in favor of a location upon the banks of the Susquehanna. The present seat of government, 
[District of Columbia,] was selected by virtue of acts passed in 1788-59. by Virginia and Maryland ceding tea 
miles square upon the Potomac under the name of Connogocheague. The first session of Congress was held 
in the District, November, 1800.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



Including the Senate, where the representation of each State is equal, it will be seen that 
the Atlantic States which sent, in 1820, one hundred and ninety-six members to Congress, 
against, sixty-two members sent from the West, sent, in 1850, but one hundred and sixty- 
seven against one hundred and twenty-nine from the West. In 1800, one hundred and thirty- 
two members represented slaveholding States, and thirty-seven, only, States without slaves. 
The present slaveholding States, which had, in 1820, ninety-seven representatives to one 
hundred and sixty-one from the free States, had in 1850, one hundred and twenty to 
one hundred and seventy-six from the Free States. Some other tables illustrating the com- 
parative rank of the States, will have place hereafter. The United States, which in 1 *790 included 
fifteen States and the District of Columbia, had increased, in 1800 to sixteen States and 
three Territories, including the District of Columbia; in 1810 to seventeen States and seven 
Territories; in 1820 to twenty-three States and five Territories; in 1830 to twenty-four 
States and five Territories; in 1840 to twenty-six States and three Territories; in 1850 to 
thirty-one States and five Territories ; and in 1854 to thirty-one States and eight organized 
Territories (including the District of Columbia, always.) 

In population, therefore, the United States, in 1850, was only exceeded by four of the Euro- 
pean powers, namely, Russia, Austria, France, and the British Empire in Europe. It is nearly 
or quite twice as populous as either Prussia, Spain, Turkey, the whole of the German States, 
the whole of the Italian States, including Greece and the Swiss republics, and excluding 
Naples and Sicily. It is nearly three times as large as the kingdoms of Sweden, Belgium, 
and Portugal combined, and is equal to the aggregate population of twenty-four out of the 
thirty-seven States into which McCulloch divides Europe. Exclusively of Ireland, it 
exceeds that of Great Britain by a population nearly equal to that of the State of Penn- 
sylvania. In comparing with the individual States, Portugal and the Netherlands find their 
counterpart in New York, Sweden and Switzerland in Pennsylvania, and Norway and Den- 
mark in Virginia.* 

Thirteen territorial governments have ceased to exist, having been absorbed by the several 
new States. Their names and the dates at which they were respectively established are as

Having given the aggregate population of the Union at the several census periods, and 
during its colonial history, it will now be proper to pass to the consideration of the statistics 
in detail, separating the color, sex, age, nativity, and condition, and condensing the facts 
and forming the ratios in regard to each under its respective chapter or division. A conclud- 
ing chapter will embrace the ratio and comparative tables of the total population, native and 
foreign, and such other facts and discussions as may not be readily or conveniently reducible 
under the previous heads. • 



*The Registrar General of Great Britain, in endeavoring to give a clear conception of the enormous number 
of persons embraced within the empire, indulges, in his report for 1851, in some rather amusing illustrations. 
He estimates the number of square miles which would be covered by them, if closely packed together, 
and the number of days they would occupy in passing through the halls of the great Crystal Palace. If a sim- 
lar indulgence might be allowed, it will be supposed that the aggregate population of the United States in 1850 
is to be formed into a single procession, in which each person shall be at a distance of six feet from any other 
a convenient walking distance. The length of such a procession would be 26,875 miles, more than sufficient 
to belt the earth itself. Whilst the head of the procession might be located where the waters of the Atlantic 
form the Chesapeake bay, a portion would be ascending the Rocky mountains, and another descending to the 
sea on the opposite extremity of the continent. Were the ocean for this purpose considered fordable, a third 
would be midway of the wide expanse of the Pacific, a fourth admiring the walls of China, a fifth lost in the 
wilds of Tartary, whilst a sixth, seventh, and eighth would be crossing the deserts of Arabia, viewing the 
ruins of Palestine, entering Greece, spreading over Germany, France, and Britain, or wending its way across 
tne basin of the Atlantic from the old world back again to the new. The glare of noonday sun lights up the 
procession in one part, in another it is immersed in the gloom of midnight darkness. The snows of Arctic 
regions, the blaze of torrid suns, and the genial breezes of the tropics divide empire alike over the ranks 
of the great procession. 

To continue the illustration, the time which it would take this procession to pass a given point on a march 
of three miles an hour, would be as follows : the free whites alone, 308 days, the men requiring 158 days, and 
the women 150 ; native born 273 days, and foreign born 35. The free blacks would require nearly 7 days ; the 
slaves 50 days, and the Indians of the forests about 6 days. The merchants, mechanics, and manufacturers 
would require 25 days, the farmers 37 days, the laborers 16 days, the sailors and boatmen 40 hours. The 
children under ten years would occupy 166 days, and the infants in the arms of their nurses, under one year 
of age, at least 10 days more. Or taking the aggregate of all, an observer would be required to stand through- 
out every hour of the day and night for three hundred and seventy-three days, to enumerate the persons as 
they passed.

The number of whites in the slaveholding States, in 1790, was 1.271.488 : in 1800. 1.702.980; 
in 1310, 2,208.785; in 1320, 2.831,560; in 1830, 3.662.606; in 1840, 4.634,519; and in 1850, 
6,222.418. 

The number of whites in the present non-slaveholdingr States, in 1790. was 1.900.976; in 
1800, 2.601,509; 1810, 3,653,219; 1820, 5,030,377; 1830T 6,874.772: 1340. 9.561,176; 1850, 
13.330,650. The persons engaged in naval service in 1S30 and 1840 are divided in proportion 
between the two sections, 

The white population which had been increasing at a declining ratio in the slaveholding 
States generally between 1790 and in 1840, increased between 1840 and 1850, 34.26 per cent^, 
being a larger ratio than at any previous period. In the non-slaveholding States the ratio in 
1S40 and 1850 differs but slightly, and is less than it was in 1810, though greater than at 
other periods. 

By the following table, it will be seen that Massachusetts, which was the first State, accord- 
ing to its white population in 1790, has now become the fourth, exactly reversing the course

of New York, which has become first from the fourth rank. Virginia has descended from the 
second to the sixth ; South Carolina from the tenth to the twenty-third ; whilst Ohio, which 
in 1800 was the seventeenth, has become the third, and Indiana, which in 1810 was the nine- 
teenth, has become the fifth in rank ; Pennsylvania has changed least of any of the States, 
being always of first, second, or third rank.

The annexed table will show the proportion which the white population of each State sus- 
tained to its total population at each of the periods mentioned. It will be seen that while the 
proportion of this class has been generally gaining at the north and in Virginia, in the South, 
except Virginia, it has been as generally losing.

INCREASE OF WHITE POPULATION. 



47 



The increase per cent of the white population in each period of ten years, is shown below 
for all of the States. The greatest increase in ten years was made in Indiana, which gained 
510 per cent, between 1810 nnd 1820; in Michigan.' which gained 574 per cent, between 1830 
and 1840, and in Wisconsin, which gained 891 per cent, between 1840 and 1850. But a single 
case of decrease of whites is to be found in the whole period, to wit: Delaware which lost a 
fraction between 1810 and 1820.

2. Families and Dwellings. — The number of families into which the white population of the 
United States is divided, and the dwellings which they occupy, though indicated separately 
upon the returns, were not taken off in the tables except in combination with the free colored. 
This was an omission which it is now too late to remedy, and the statistics upon the subiect 
will therefore be postponed to Chapter VI. which treats of the details of aggregate population. 

The schedules do not give the relation of the members of the family to its head, as was 
recommendA. and as it is given in Great Britain. Massachusetts, etc. It Would theu be prac- 
ticable to ascertain the average number of children to a family, the number of female as well 
as male servants, the number who are living in the married, single or widowed state, ire. A 
census cannot be complete without these facts. At present nothing but unsatisfactory approxi- 
mations can be made from the materials of the office in regard to them, and nothing has, 
therefore, been attempted. 

3. Seat. — The number of white males in the United States in 1850 was 10.02*3.402. and of 
white females 9.526.666. Of these 8,786.968 males and 8.525.565 females were ascertained to 
be native born, and 1,239.434 males and 1,001,101 females to be foreign born. The following 
table will show the number of white males and females at each census from 1T90 to 1850.

It appears from the above that the number of white females in the United States, at every 
census, has been from four to sLx in a hundred, nearly, less than that of the males, and that 
the excess of the males has been increasing, though in no very regular manner. In 1850 it 
was greater than at any other period. 

The increase of white males and females and the per centages of the increase of both to- 
gether, in periods of ten years, are shown in the following table :

f These are also apportioned between tho sexes.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



In New England it will be seen that the females are always in excess, in some cases as much as 
3 in 100, as in 1820. In all the other divisions of the Union, males are in excess for every period, 
the excess being greatest generally in the Southwest, where it is about 100 males to 91 females. 
In the Territories and California there are nearly three times as many males as females. 

4, Age* — In 1850, 53*7,661 white persons in the United States were under one year of age, 
and 2,358, 797 one and under five; 7, 2 3 4, 9 7 3 were in youth or between 5 and 20; 7,633,288 
were in maturity or between 20 and 50; 1,111,255 were between 50 and 100, (13,198 were 
between 80 and 100 ;) and 181, were in extreme old age or 100 and over. In the dependent 
class under 15 there were 8,002,715; in the producing class between 15 and 60 there were 
10,720,115 ; in the supported class above 60, there were 819,871 ; of the males between 15 and 
60, or those capable in emergency of bearing arms, the number was 5,542,785 ; the latest en- 
rolments of militia as reported by the War Department, giving only 2,006,456. On a com- 
putation there were 4,684,883 white males of twenty-one years of age and upwards. The 
ages of the native and foreign born population have not been distinguished in the classifica- 
tions made in the office, although a very important distinction ; nor can the number of natu- 
ralized foreigners be known from the returns. It is therefore impossible to ascertain the num- 
ber of persons entitled to the right of suffrage. Still, however, some estimate may be made. 
Supposing the foreign born males of 21 and over, to be 60 per cent, of the whole foreign born 
males (the per cent, for the native and foreign being 47) and supposing that half of the foreign 
born males over 21 are capable of voting somewhere, (these suppositions have reference to the 
ages of foreigners who arrive and to the fact that they vote at early periods in the new States) 
the number of such voters would be 371,839; and the number of male foreigners over 21 not 
capable of voting would also be 371,839. Deduct these from the whole males over 21, and 
the number of persons actually capable of enjoying the elective franchise; would be 4,313,044, 
giving to every free native citizen that right The foreign vote, therefore, (including those 
who have come into the country from the earliest times) would be but one- twelfth of the total. 

A table of the actual votes cast in the different States in the Union at the three last Presi- 
dential elections, is annexed, and though it is not official it yet comes from a source entitled 
to entire credit. A column has been added to show the number of males, native and foreign, 
of 21 years and over, in the several States in 1852. The number was obtained by ascertaining 
the number of 21 years and under, and deducting this from the total male whites, then 
adding for increase for 1850 to 1852 according to the increase in the several States between 
1840 and 1850. California and Texas being introduced since 1840, no ratio of increase could 
be ascertained and therefore the figures are for 1850.

* As to age, the Marshals were instructed to take the specific age at the last birth day previous to the first of 
June, and if the exact age could not be ascertained, then to give the nearest approximation. Under one year 
to be given in months. 

t Incomplete. In S. Carolina electors are chosen by the legislature ; had the vote been popular there, the whoie 
vote for 1852 in the U. States would have reached about 3,170,000. Adding for S. Carolina, and the probable 
increase of Texas and California, the whole number over 21 in 1852 in the U. States would be about 5,222,314.

By the table of ages it will be seen that the age of nineteen nearly divides the whites into 
two parts — that nearly two-fifths of the whole are between the ages of twenty and fifty, and 
les-s than one-tenth over fifty ; whilst more than one-half are nnder twenty years of age.

The proportion of persons at the different ages given, varies very little for the first, second 
and third census; about one-third of the population at each period being under 10 years of 
age, another third between 16 and 26, and the remainder over that age. The number under 
five has been decreasing since 1830, and constitutes less than one-seventh of the whole. Those 
between ten and fifteen and fifteen and twenty have also been decreasing, whilst there has 
been.a pretty steady increase in the number of persons at the ages above 20, and under 90. 
The number of those aged over ninety, has slightly declined in ratio. There were 539 cente- 
narians in 1830 ; 791 in 1840, and 787 in 1850. To estimate the chances of reaching these 
ages, their proportion must be known to the whole number alive one hundred years ago, &c. 
The unknown ages for the whites amounted in 1850, for the whole Union, to 10,307. 

It will be seen that for every period under fifteen years of age, the males are in excess 
in all of the States and Territories in 1850, with only few eyeptions, the most remarkable of 
which are the District of Columbia and Rhode Island. Between fifteen and twenty an excess 
of females exists in most of the States. The most notable exceptions are those of Vermont 
where to each 100 males there are 95.98 females, and California, 100 males to 19 females. 
From the age of twenty to fifty, the males are in excess, except in some of the Northern States, 
the Carolinas, &c. For very old persons the excess is with the females, the exceptions being 
chiefly in the new States. It will be seen that the ages of the females are more generally re- 
turned than those of the males. At best the number of unreturned ages constitutes but a 
small part of the whole, and perhaps results as much from the carelessness of enumerators as 
from refusals of parties themselves.

By the annexed table it will be perceived that for 1800, 1810 and 1820, the white females 
under 10 are fewer than the males, but have been gaining upon them in proportion. This is 
also the case between ten and sixteen and between twent3 r -six and forty-five. Above forty- 
five, though the females are less, the ratios are more uniform. Between sixteen and twenty- 
six the females are more, numerous than the males and increase their advantage. For 1830, 
and 1840, the females under five, between five and ten, and ten and fifteen, are less than 
the males, though gaining upon them. Between twenty and seventy the males are still 
in excess and gain upon the females. Between fifteen and twenty there is a large and 
growing excess of females, attributable in some slight degree, as Prof. Tucker intimates, to 
the anxiety of the sex to retain this interesting age. This can be proved in another way.* 
At all periods over seventy the females preponderate with only two exceptions.

* Those who were under ten at one census should be of ten and under twenty years at the next. In conse- 
quence of deaths the number would be less, were there no foreign immigration. Thus there were 3,427,730 
under 10 in 1830, and 3,364,277 between ten and twenty in 1840, &c. The numbers between twenty and thirty 
seem to show a disposition to retain those ages on the part of both sexes.

5. Births. Marriages and Deaths. — The tables of the census "which undertake to give the total 
number of Births. Marriages and Deaths, in the year preceding the first of June, 1850, can be 
said to have but very little value. Xothing short of a registration system in the States can 
give the required data satisfactorily, and it has been proved that even where such systems 
have been best established, difficulties continually arise which require a very long time to be 
removed. Experience has shown that people will not, or cannot, remember and report to the 
census taker the number of the facts, and the particulars of them which occur in the period 
of a whole year to eighteen months prior to the time of his calling. It might be possible to 
obtain them for a single month. 

Births. — Only those persons born within the year and surviving at the end of it, are in- 
cluded in the table of births : in other words it comprises the figures of the column of popula- 
tion under one year of age. It was made up in this manner in the Maryland table, adopted 
by Congress as the model for this. To arrive at the true number of births some laborious 
calculations become necessary. It will not do to add to the living the number that have died 
under one year of age, as was done in another place in the Maryland volume : the aggregate 
becomes then too large. A child who had died two months before the first of June, at the 
age of eleven months, and so for other parallel cases, would be considered as a death under 
one year of age. though certainly not a birth within the year. Time does not admit of these 
precise and laborious calculations, and if it did, as Congress failed to order publication of 
the details of the deaths, the office has not yet been free to incur the expense of an investiga- 
tion, which, at the best, considering the deficiencies of the reports, would be only to substi- 
tute one approximation for another. The census takers too, in many counties have adopted 
one year as the lowest designation of age, and for this reason, also, the births are deficient, 
more especially for slaves. 

An experiment made upon Rhode Island, mentioned in the note, gives, for the figures to be 
added to the births from the death statistics 163.* If this were assumed to be anything of an 
average for all of the States, the list of births would be increased by 24.173 and make an 
aggregate of 653,917 for all classes.! 



* In Rhode Island out of 353 deaths of children reported as under one year of age, 163 only were born within 
the year preceding the first of June. 

t During the year ending June 1st, 1850, the deaths of persons under one year of age reported in the various 
States and Territories were respectively as follows : Alabama 2.023, including 1,190 slaves ; Arkansas 524, 
including 134 slaves; California 36 ; District of Columbia 154, including 11 slaves; Connecticut 705; Dela- 
ware 239, including 7 slaves ; Florida 147. including 85 slaves ; Georgia 2.283. including 1,373 slaves ; Illinois 
2.270; Indiana 2,269; Iowa 446 ; Kentucky 2,710, including 808 slaves ; Louisiana 1.275. including 538 slaves ; 
Maine 919 ; Maryland 2,090, including 306 slaves ; Massachusetts 2.842 ; Michigan 856 ; Minnesota Territory 5 ; 
Mississippi 1,839, including 798 slaves ; Missouri 1,954, including 273 slaves ; New Hampshire 451 ; New Mexico 



58 STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 

The table of Marriages in the census includes only the white population in some of the 
States, In others, the white and free colored. Tn a few instances, in the first case, free colored 
marriages have been also noted, and are included. In the other case, though generally included, 
much less care seems to have been exercised with them than with the whites. The remark is, 
however, only applicable to the slave States. No comparison of the proportion of the mar- 
riages to the total population can be made, as the marriages of slaves are not included. It 
will be observed that the figures refer to the number of persons married, and are, therefore, 
twice the number of actual marriages in the year, admitting them all to be returned, which, at 
a glance, any one can see is far from being the fact* 

In regard to the number of Deaths, the returns of the census are not likely to deceive any 
one, since an attempt to reason from them would exhibit a degree of vitality and healthful- 
ness in the United States unparalleled in the annals of any nation, and demonstrate between 
county and county and State and State, the most extraordinary differences in sanitary condi- 
tion. The truth is but a part of the deaths have been recorded, varying for sections from a 
very small to a very large part of the whole. 

The various ratio and detailed tables of Marriages and Deaths, will be embraced under the 
chapter of aggregate population, since they cannot be separated for the whites. Those of 
Births being merely the white children under one year of age, as before explained, will be 
found in the table of ages. 

6. Deaf, Dumb, Blind, Insane and Idiotic. — The tables which follow will exhibit the total 
number of white persons returned by the census of 1830, 1840 and 1850 as affected in either of 
these ways. The statistics have not been collected for any earlier period. The ages of neither 
class, except the deaf and dumb in 183,0 and 1840 have been published, although they would 
add greatly to the value of the information. It is of little importance for example to know the 
mere number of blind and idiotic, if they are of extreme old age, and therefore beyond the age 
of treatment. Upon the age of the person will depend the opportunity or hope of his amelio- 
ration. The following tables will show the ages of the deaf and dumb whites in 1830 and 
1840, and the ages of the same class of deaf and dumb, blind, insane and idiotic in 1850, for a 
few of the States. They are the results of an earlier examination, and therefore the aggre- 
gates do not correspond with those of the regular tables. The total number of deaf, dumb, 
blind, &c, whites, will be found in the table which follows. The figures are those that were 
published in the quarto volume of the census. It was there observed that they differed for 
1850 in some respects, owing to re-examination, from those that were previously published, 
but that such differences were unavoidable, even with the most careful persons, in running 
over so many millions of names, to select the particular facts. The letters indicating the in- 
sane and idiotic could not always be distinguished on the returns. Persons with more than 
one infirmity, as for example, being deaf and dumb and blind and insane, could be put by 
different classifiers under either one of those heads it suited. Being considered to belong to 
only one of the classes, the rule in the earlier examinations was to select the class of greater 
infirmity. In the later examination the infirmity first named, as a rule, gave character to 
the person, a rule not more arbitrary, but certainly less liable to different constructions. In 
1830 and 1840 the individunl instead of being placed under one of the heads was placed under 
all of them. As cases of the kind supposed did not in 1850 exceed in 16 States one per cent, 
of the whole the disturbance from this cause, cannot be very material. In poor-houses, hos- 
pitals, &c, it is often difficult to determine from the returns whether the party be pauper 
only or blind pauper, etc. The dumb are included, but those deaf only, are excluded from the 
columns of the deaf and dumb. The total number of the deaf reported by the marshals, 
though they were not instructed to report them, and no doubt generally obeyed their instruc- 
tions, was 3,050 in the Union.f 

Territory 207; New York 6,708 ; New Jersey 1,081 ; North Carolina 1,912, including 1,059 slaves ; Ohio 4,420 ; 
Oregon Territory 5 ; Pennsylvania 4,977 ; Rhode Island 353 ; South Carolina 1,416 including 1,120 slaves • 
Tennessee 2,545, including 1,028 slaves ; Texas 555, including 186 slaves; Utah Territory 41 ; Virginia 3,150, 
including 1,565 slaves ; Vermont 301 ; Wisconsin 645. 

* The marriages did not necessarily take place in the county, nor even the State of the parties residence. 

f " It is not generally understood that a degree of deafness which is little more than a serious social incon- 
venience when it occurs in middle life, or comes with other infirmities in old age, occurring in infancy, would 
induce dumbness, or at least disqualify the child for instruction in ordinary schools. The child under ten, 
who is deaf, will hereafter become mute, at least so far, that he needs and is entitled to the privileges of 
a special institution for the education of deaf mutes. The man or woman who becomes deaf in mature life, 
does not therefore become mute. Such cases might, as a part of vital statistics, be noted as well as the cases 
of those who become blind late in life ; but to judge of the probable number of deaf mutes, who require the 
means of education, the deaf who become so late, should be carefully distinguished from those who are so 
from birth or infancy. This can be done in another census by merely noting in each case at what age the 
hearing was lost, and we would suggest this as a very desirable improvement whenever a census of the deaf 
and dumb is taken." Dr. Peet.

By comparing the above table with one made up from the British Census of 1841, (the re- 
turns for 1851 embracing these particulars not having been yet received.) it will be seen that 
whilst for our oldest States, such as North Carolina, South Carolina. Virginia, Maryland 
and Pennsylvania, only 95. 92, 90, T8 and 79 per cent respectively of the free population (the 
proportion will not be affected for the slave) were born in the States of their residence, in Eng- 
land there were 96 per cent.: in Ireland 99.58.; in Scotland, 93 per cent. In some of our States 
such as "Wisconsin. Iowa and California the proportion runs down as low as seventeen, twenty- 
one, and eight per cent. Only sixteen per cent, in England and five per cent, in Ireland resided 
out of their native counties ! The proportion of foreign born was not more than one-tenth 
of one per cent, in Scotland, one-twentieth of one per cent in Ireland, and one-fiftieth of one 
per cent, in England against over eleven per cent, in the United States, thirty-six per cent 
in "Wisconsin, and twenty-six per cent in Louisiana, one-half of one per cent in X/orth Caro- 
lina, and three-quarters of one per cent in Tennessee.

combined for the white and free colored, and, in some cases, for white, free colored and slaves. 



CHAPTER IV. 

FEEE COLOEED POPULATION. 



1. Aggregate.— -The free colored population of the United States in 1850 amounted to 434,495, 
of whom 275,400 were black, or of unmixed African descent, and 159,095 mulattoes, of mixed 
African and other blood.* [See table under Slaves.] The distinction was not observed 
in any census prior to 1850. For some remarks upon free blacks in the colonies, see 
ante, p. 37. 

* Where the proportion is less than one-eighth of African blood the distinction of class begins to be obscured. 
The Mestizo is the issue of the Indian and the Negro, and has all the disabilities of the mulatto. The free colored 
are made up of those and their descendants who have been emancipated, either by general law or by individuals ; 
those who are fugitives from slavery and their descendants, with a small admixture of such as have come into 
the country in a state of freedom and their descendants. 

The decrease in the free colored persons of Louisiana, shown in the table, in 1850, is supported by the 
State census. It seems to be chiefly in New Orleans, where the decline has been 9,321 since 1840, or about 
one-half. The third municipality alone declined from 8,704 in 1840 to 3,524 in 1850, or nearly two-thirds. The 
average number of colored persons to a family in the third municipality in 1840 was ten and one-half, and in 
1850 five and one-seventh. All of this is very extraordinary, and leads to the conviction that errors were com- 
mitted in one or the other period, (almost certainly the first,) or that free mulattoes have been passing into the 
white column, which is not shown, however, in the increase of the whites in that municipality since 1840. 
The colored persons who are known to have left the city will not account for this decline of one-half, notwith- 
standing the natural increase.

The table in the chapter on Slave Population will show the distribution of Blacks and Mn- 
lattoes in the States, whether free or slave, and their proportion to the total of either class of 
population. The material not having been prepared when the other facts of population were 
being tabulated, could not now be presented in greater detail without expense and delay. 
For purposes of comparison, the returns have been subsequently searched for Connecticut, 
Louisiana, (New Orleans being separated) and Xew York City, and all of the facts relating 
to free blacks and mulattoes carefully aggregated, as will appear hereafter. 

The increase and decrease per cent, of the free colored population in the great divisions of 
the Union, are shown as follows.

f This is a decrease, and the only instance. The immigration of free colored from abroad cannot be ascer- 
tained, but is very small. Their emigration is also small, consisting of those who go to Canada — those from 
Louisiana to France, and those generally to Liberia. By the report of the Colonization Society, made in 1852, 
it seems that in 32 years. 7.592 p Q rsons have been sent to that colony, including 800 to the colony of Maryland, 
and 1.044 liberated Africans. The "present emigrant population' of the colony," is stated at ••about six 
or seven thousand." The emigrants were from Massachusetts 10. Rhode Island 32. Connecticut 30. New

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



The declining ratio of the increase of the free colored in every section is notable. Tn New 
England the increase is now almost nothing. In the South West it is much reduced, 
owing in some degree to errors in the Louisiana report in 1840. In the Southern States the 
increase is only one-fourth as great as between 1800 and 1810. The North West shows the 
heaviest ratios of increase, indicating a large emigration to that quarter.**

The increase and decrease per cent, of the free colored population in each period of ten 
years is shown below for all of the States. The greatest increase in ten years was in Ken- 
tucky, 1800, 550 per cent; in Ohio, 1810, 463 per cent; in Michigan, 1850, 265 per cent; in 
Wisconsin, 1850, 243 per cent; in Illinois, in 1830, 258 per cent. The least increase oc- 
curred in Massachusetts, in 1820, .04 per cent, and in 1850, 4.55 per cent; in Connec- 
ticut, in 1830, 2.58 per cent; and in 1840, 0.*72 per cent; in Maine, in 1850, 0.07, per cent. In 
1800 there was a decrease in two States; in 1820, in seven ; in 1830 in two; in 1840 in four ; 
and in 1850, in six. The greatest decrease was in Missouri, in 1820, of 42 per cent, and in 
Louisiana and Mississippi, in 1850, of 31 per cent. The others were in Rhode Island in the 
years 1800 and 1820; in Tennessee in 1800; in Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, 
New Hampshire, in 1820 ; in New Hampshire and Vermont, in 1830, &c.

** On the schedules 1,467 slaves are returned in 1850, as emancipated in the slaveholding States during the 
previous year, increasing the total free colored population by about one in 1,800, and in Maryland by about one in 
150. Admitting an equal number emancipated during every year between 1840 and 1850, and one-third of the 
number emancipated during every year from 1790 to 1840, and 500 annually from 1770 to 1790, (the figures 
will be considered to fall short of the reality, in remembering that emancipation has been retarded in later 
lyears, and that those for 1850 are very low,) the total number emancipated at the South since the Itevo- 
ution would be set down at 50,000, The number emancipated by general law in the other States may be

The rank "which the States held with reference to each other, considered with regard to the 
free colored population only, at each census, is herewith shown. Maryland, during forty

The following table ^M. show the proportion of the free colored population in each State 
to its total populationlrreach of the periods named. It has decreased in New England not- 
withstanding its accession from its own slaves, and fugitives from other States, except in 
Connecticut, where there has been an increase. This increase is notable in other Northern 
States. In Delaware the free colored from six per cent, in 1790, in 1850 were nineteen per 
cent In Maryland from 2.51 per cent, in 1790, were 12 per cent in 1850. Nearly one-fifth 
of the inhabitants of the District of Columbia are free colored. In the other Southern States, 
except North Carolina and Kentucky the proportion is declining. In Louisiana it has de- 
clined from nearly 10 per cent, in 1810 to a little over 3 per cent in 1850, but see note ante 
In nearly all the other States there is a proportionate decline.

ascertained by an estimate of their slave population at the periods of emancipation, if it be admitted that all 
of the slaves "received the benefit of the emancipating acts. A liberal estimation will earn- the figures to 
50.000 or 51.000. By the mode of arranging the returns, the slaves liberated in 1849-1850 are counted still as 
slaves, and are, no doubt, in many cases, counted again as free colored. 

Tin* number of fugitive slaves or those who had absconded during the year 1849-1 850, and had not been 
heard from, was 1 .01 1 , by the reports. As might be supposed, the border States, Maryland, Missouri and Ken- 
tucky, show the largest proportion, being respectively one in 320, one in 1.450, and one in 2,100. In Georgia 
and Louisiana the proportion was one in 2,700, and one in 4,000, respectively

As with the whites, it will he seen that in New England with the free colored the females are 
alwars in excess. This excess of free colored females is found at every census in the Middle, 
Southern and Southwestern States; the reverse of the whites, the excess being from 113 to 
121 to the 100 in the Southwest. In the Northwest and the Territories the males preponderate ; 
in the last instance very largely.

under one year of age. it will be necessary to refer to that column of the classification of ages. 
The proportion to the whole free colored, population will be one birth to every 39 persons. 
Separating the black from the mulatto the following will result for two States and two Cities

Marriages. — The free colored marriages were not separated from those of the whites. They 
seem not to hare been noticed at all upon the returns in most of the Slave States. The reporte 
of Registration in the States do not separate the colors. The colored marriages are condensed 
from the returns for Connecticut fee, as above. There were 117 deaths of blacks and 28 of 
mulattoes reported in Connecticut: 53 blacks and 1m mulattoes in Louisiana ; 28 blacks and 9 
mulattoes in Michigan, of the free colored population in 1850. For the other States the mu- 
lattoes and blacks are combined in the tables. 

6. Deaf, Dumb and Blind. — Objection was taken to the statistics of the Deaf and Dumb, 
Blind, fee., for 1830 and 1840. so far as they relate to the non-Slaveholding States, and a me- 
morial vas sent to Congress from several persons in Boston, protesting against their publica- 
tion. The memorial, a history of which is given on the next page, was referred to the 
Department of State, and that Department entrusted its examination to a gentleman who ha-d

been charged with the preparation of the census of 1840 for the press.* The Secretary in 
transmitting his Report, now in manuscript in the office, and dated February 12th, 1845, says : 

" On a review of the whole, two conclusions, it is believed, will be found to follow inevitably. The one 
is that the correctness of the late census in exhibiting a far greater prevalence of the diseases of insanity, 
blindness, deafness, and dumbness, stands unimpeachable. That it may contain errors, more or less, is hardly 
to be doubted. It would be a miracle if such a document, with so many figures and entries, did not. But 
that they have, if they exist, materially affected the correctness of the general result, would seem hardly pos- 
sible. Nothing but that the truth is so, would seem capable of explaining the fact that, in all the non-Slave- 
holding States, without exception, the census exhibits, uniformly, a far greater comparative prevalence of these 
diseases among the free blacks than among the slaves of the other States. They are indeed vastly more so 
among the most favorable of the former than in the least favorable of the latter." 

The leading fact relied upon by the memorialists was the mention of insane, or deaf and 
dumb colored persons in towns, townships, &c, in the free States, where the census reported 
no free colored persons at all, or a lees number, or only an equal number existing. To this it 
is answered in the report that the memorialists have reference to uncorrected copies of the 
census in manuscript in Boston, and not to the corrected originals as published by the State 
Department. These originals, when consulted, greatly reduce the number of alleged discrep- 
ancies. Others of them are explained by the omission of the census takers after entering the 
colored person in the insane column to enter him again in the population column. The me- 
morialists only extended their examination to the Northern States. The present Superin- 
tendent of the Census extended the examination to the Slaveholding States also, and found the 
same omissions existing there both in 1830 and in 1840, and is of the opinion that they occurred 
generally throughout the country.f The insane and deaf and dumb &c, of the colored popu- 
lation would therefore bear a larger proportion, as well at the South as the North, according 
to the published census, to the whole of that class, than was the fact. The memorialists 
therefore did not meet the whole case. The ratio in the free States where the colored are com- 
paratively few, would of course be more affected by the omissions than in the Slave States, where 
they are very numerous. The census takers in 1830 and 1840 had the right under the act to 
locate on the returns persons without a regular place of abode, wherever they might be found, 
or in any part of the district most convenient, and this accounted for deaf and dumb, &c, 
colored, appearing sometimes in places where the residents would afterwards deny the exis- 
tence of any such. 

A strong circumstance supporting the census of 1840 grew out of its near correspondence 
with that of 1830, in the ratio of the affected to the whole colored population. It becomes 
necessary to suppose that different sets of persons, residents of the localities, without concert, 
after a lapse of ten years, and with all the checks imposed by the census law, and the pub- 
licity required in the exposure of the returns before sending them to Washington, have fallen 
into the same errors, designedly, which no one can for a moment suppose, or accidentally. 

Notwithstanding these explanations, and the very strong support given by one census to the 
other, there still . remains the chance, in either, of insane, or deaf and dumb white persons 
falling by accident into the colored columns. The chances for this error were equal in every 
part of the Union, though such an error in the non-Slaveholding States, as before remarked, 
would have vastly more effect than in the others. For example, a mistake of 1 where the total 
is 100, will make a difference of one per cent, but where the total is 1,000 it will be but one- 
tenth of one per cent. 

Since the results of the census of 1850 have been ascertained, it is quite probable that the 
ratios at the North in 1830 and 1840 did suffer for some of the reasons above given, as the 
three cannot be reconciled upon any other supposition, and the first cannot be attacked upon 
any ground which would materially invalidate it. If no greater disposition may be supposed 
among the free colored to withhold the information in 1850 than in 1840 or 1830, the only 
chance of error would remain of their insane, &c, being accidentally entered under the white 
column, from the neglect of the marshal to indicate the color of the person. Such omissions 
a few instances occur, increasing the whites and the insane whites, and diminishing the 
t and the insane colored, and they will perhaps account for a small part of the decline, 

cu - uie small ratio of the increase in some cases, of free colored at the North.t 
t 

* Feb. 26th, 1844. — Motion made by Mr. Adams, of Mass., in the House, directing inquiries in regard to 
certain alleged errors in the Census. 

May 16th, 1844.— Letter received from the Secretary of State informing the House that no such errors had 
been discovered. 

Jan. 28th, 1845.— Resolution adopted directing the Secretary of State to inform the House of the steps taken 
to ascertain whether the errors imputed by certain memorialists existed, and whether they were of such a 
character as to impeach the general correctness of the Census. 

Feb. 12th, 1845.— Letter received from the Secretary of State, transmitting a report in relation to alleged 
errors In the Census report. The letter and report were referred to a select committee from Massachusetts, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Maine, Indiana, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, but no 
further action seems to have been had upon them. 

f For example, taking up at random the first schedules which come to hand. In the schedules of 1830, on 
page 52, under the head of Edgefield District, S. C, there is one colored deaf and dumb not reported in the 
total colored ; Chesterfield District, page 32, one in the same way, &c, &c. In the schedules of 1840, in Lau- 
rens District, S. C , one on page 28 ; on page 38, one ; on page 44, one ; in Lexington District, on page 5, one ; 
on page 30, one: in Marion District, on page 3, three ; on page 50, one : in Pickens District, on page 2, one : 
in Missouri, St. Charles county, on page 3, one; in St. Louis county on page 11, one ; in St. Ferdinand, one; 
Stoddard, one; Scott, one; Benton, one, &c, &c. All of these deaf, dumb and blind are reported in 
families where no colored persons are stated to exist in the population column. 

J The memorialists, in examining the Census of 1830 and 1840, when descending to particular facts, exposed 
two notable errors. One in Worcester, Massachusetts, by which a whole institution was entered in the wrong 
column, and one in Plympton. Both of these are corrected in the tables now published for 1840. Out of 79 



FREE COLORED DEAF AND DUMB, &< 



77 



Admitting however the census of 1850 to be entirely correct, and the others incorrect, the 
proportion of the whole colored persons, deaf, dumb and blind, in the non-slaveholding States 
is one in every 919, and in the Slaveholding States, one in every 1,517. For the insane and 
idiotic the proportion in the non-Slaveholding States, is one in 709 ; in the Slaveholding 
States, one in 1,821. But if errors are admitted in all of the Census, and that they would 
probably balance each other, a mean of the three shows for the deaf and dumb and blind, 
insane and idiotic, one in every 505 colored in the non-Slaveholding States, and one in 
every 1,446 in the Slaveholding States. Such a table will be found in the Chapter of Aggre- 
gate Population. The columns for the mean being made up from other similar columns do 
not express the result exactly, but yet with sufficient approximation.

specifications of error made by them, eleven were the result of their consulting the Boston copy of the returns, 
and sixteen others were cases in which there might or might not have been error. Most of the other cases 

admitted of the explanation in the text. For example, they say : " Deputy Marshal W states there 

were 133 colored lunatics in the family of W , but on another page he says there are no colored in said 

family." By referring to the returns in this office, the Marshal appears to be " E " — and so far from saying 

there are no colored, he actually returned seven. Again, the memorialists say, '-'in the family of P , 

town of Pepperell, there are sixteen colored lunatics, &c, after it is stated in another place there are no 
colored persons in the family." The returns show that the marshal did not mention any such colored lu- 
natics, and none are published. They say, again, " that nineteen colored persons were reported deaf and 
dumb or blind, &c, in Higham and Scituate, and that the overseers of the poor state that no such persons 
have lived there within twelve years, and that the deputy marshal never reported such persons." By refer- 
ence to the office reports, it appears that the marshal did return them ; that it was not necessary, as before 
said, that the parties should have lived in the towns mentioned, but if transient persons, might have been 
entered any where, they accidentally happened to be. Besides, nineteen affections such as blind, &c. do not 
necessarily indicate nineteen individuals affected, but may only embrace six, as a person is sometimes blind and 
insane, blind and idiotic, blind, deaf and dumb, &c. Finally, the memorialists say they "have made private 
inquiries in forty-four towns of Massachusetts, and have not found one colored lunatic or idiot." In another 
place they admit that the State authorities in the same counties found sixteen at public charge, exclusively of 
those at private charge. The printed Census gave but forty.

Out of 7,693 free colored persons in Connecticut, 1,7/98 were mulattoes, of whom 48 were born 
in the slave States. Out of 13,815 free colored in New York city, 3,066 were mulattoes. Thus, 
in both instances, the mulattoes constituted less than one-fourth of the free colored population. 
About one-fifth of the free colored in New York were born in the present slave States.

Thus, of the free colored population of New York city, sixty were clerks, doctors, drug- 
gists, lawyers, merchants, ministers, printers, students, and teachers, or one in about fifty-five; 
in New Orleans there were one hundred and sixty-five, or one in eleven, engaged in similar 
pursuits which may be considered as requiring education. The remainder are mechanics, 
laborers, and waiters. The " other occupations ' ; include for the most part sweeps, scavengers, 
etc. Of those engaged in pursuits requiring education, one-third are mulattoes, though the 
proportion of mulattoes to the whole free colored is between a fourth and a,fifth. 

In Connecticut there are only twenty individuals engaged in occupations requiring educa- 
tion, or one in one hundred of the whole. In Louisiana the number is one hundred and 
eighty-five, or one in twelve of the whole free colored. The ratios of black and mulatto may 
also be studied to advantage in the several occupations.

Of these Slaves in 1850, 2,95 l 7,65'7 were "black or of unmixed African descent, and 246,656 
were mulatto. The distribution in the different States and many interesting ratios of the two 
colors will be found in the table following. 

The mulattoes in the United States are about one-eighth as numerous as the blacks — the 
free mulattoes are more than half the number of the free blacks, whilst the slave mulattoes 
are only about one-twelfth of the slave blacks. Between the States the ratios are very remark- 
able. Whilst nearly half of the colored in the non-slaveholding States are mulatto, only 
about one-ninth in the slaveholding States are mulatto, excluding New Jersey. In Ohio and 
the Territories there are more mulattoes than blacks. In nearly all of the slave States, except 
Kentucky, Delaware and Missouri, &c, the free mulattoes greatly preponderate over the free 
blacks. Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas have the largest portion of slave mulattoes, 
and in the District of Columbia they are about one-fourth of the whole. 

It will be observed from, the above table, that slavery, which in 1*790, existed in all of the 
States, except two, in 1850 did not exist in fifteen States, and that ten States which returned 
Slaves in 1*40 returned none in 1850, slave schedules not having been sent to them in that year 

* Deducted to make the aggregate, published incorrectly in that year.

In the Chapter upon Colonial Population, and in the note, will be found some statistics of 
the early slave population of the United States. Another statement of the date of 1TT6 exists, 
in "which the slaves are entered as follows: Massachusetts 3,500; Rhode Island 4,373; Con- 
necticut 6,000; New Hampshire 629; New York 15,000; New Jersey 7,600; Pennsylvania 
10,000; Delaware 9,000; Maryland 80,000; Virginia 165,000; North Carolina 15,000;* South 
Carolina 110,000; and Georgia 16,000;' total, 502,1324 



* By State Census of 1852, 1,678 blacks, 578 mulattoes. t Reported on their way to California. 

X Slavery, which had existed in all of the nations of antiquity and throughout Europe during the middle ages, 
was introduced at an early day into the colonies. The first introduction of African slaves was in 1620, by a 
Dutch vessel from Africa to Virginia. Mr. Carey, of Pennsylvania, in his work upon the Slave Trade says, 
" the trade in negro slaves to the American colonies was too small before 1753 to attract attention." In that 
year Macpherson (" Annals of Commerce'') says five hundred and eleven were imported into Charleston, and 
in 1765-1766 those imported into Georgia, (from their valuation,) could not have exceeded 1,482. From 1783 to 
1787 the British West Indies exported to the colonies 1 ,392, nearly 300 per annum. These West Indies were 
then the entrepot of the trade, and though they received nearly 20,000 (Macpherson) in the period above named, 
they sent to the colonies but that small number, proving the demand could not have been large. After a close 
argument from the ratio of increase since the first census, Mr. Carey is enabled to recur backhand compute the 
population at earlier periods, separating the native born from those derived from importations. Setting out 
with the fact that the staves (blacks) numbered 55.650 in 1714, he finds that 30,000 of these were brought 

from Africa 30.000 

Importations between 1715 and 1750 90.000 

« « 1751 " 1760 35^000 

" " 1761 « 1770 74.000 

" « 1771 " 1790 34,000 

* " 1790 " 1808...... 70,000 

Total number imported 333.000 

The number since 1790 is evidently too small. Charleston alone, in the four years 1S04, 1805, 1806 and 1807, 
imported 39,075. § Making, therefore, a correction for such under estimate-, and a very liberal increase to Mr. 

§ These were consigned to 91 British subjects, 88 citizens of Rhode Island, 10 French subjects and 13 natives 
of Charleston. (Census of Charleston, p. 141, 1849.)

The increase and decrease per cent, of the slaves in each decennial period is shown for all 
of the States. The greatest increase in ten years was in Illinois, in 1820, 445 per cent.; in 
Mississippi, in 1810, 389 per cent.; in Arkansas, in 1840, 335 per cent; in Tennessee in 1800, 
297 per cent; and Kentucky in 1800, 241 per cent The greatest decrease in ten years was in 
New York, in 1830, 99 per cent; Indiana, in 1830, 98 per cent; in New York in 1840, 94 per 
cent The least increase in ten years was in Maryland, in 1800, 2 per cent; and in 1820, 3 
per cent; in North Carolina in 1840, and Maryland in 1850, less than 1 per cent. Virginia, 
which had declined 4 per cent, between 1830 and 1840, increased 5 per cent, between 1840 
and 1850. 

The increase of slaves in the Southern Atlantic States has only averaged about 2 per cent 
per annum in fifty years, though averaging 18 per cent, per annum in the Gulf States, &c. for 
the last twenty years.

Carey's figures, the whole number of Africans at all times imported into the United States would not exceed 
375 or 400,000. 

Thus, in the United States, the number of Africans and their descendants is nearly eight or ten to one of 
those that were imported, whilst in the British West Indies there are not two persons remaining for every five 
of the imported, and their descendants. This is seen from the following : Imported into Jamaica previously 
to 1817, 700,000 negroes, of whom and their descendants but 311,000 remained after 178 years to be emancipated 
in 1833. In the whole British West Indies, — imported 1,700,000, of whom and their descenndats 660,000 
remained for emancipation. ( Carey.) 

The Continental Congress of 1774 resolved to discontinue the slave trade, in which resolution they were an- 
ticipated by the Conventions of Delegates of Virginia and North Carolina. In 1789 the convention to frame 
the federal constitution, looked to the abolition of the traffic in 1808. On the 2nd of March, 1807, Congress 
passed an act against importations of Africans into the United States after January 1st, 1808. An act in Great 
Britain in 1807 also made the slave trade unlawful. Denmark forbid the introduction of African slaves into 
her colonies after 1804. The Congress of Vienna, in 1815, pronounced for the abolition of the trade. France 
abolished it in 1817, and also Spain, but the acts were to take effect after 1820. Portugal abolished it in 1818. 
The slave trade in these instances, continued in despite of the abolition. The average number of slaves, ac- 
cording to the Report of the London Slave Trade Committee, exported from the coast of Africa, averaged 
85,000 per annum, from 1798 to 1805 ; and from 1835 to 1840 there was a total of 135,810 ; in 1846 and 1847, the 
import was 84,000 per annum. Between 1840 and 1847, 249,800 were taken to Brazil, and 52,027 into the 
Spanish colonies, etc. (See. Report of Select Committee of the House of Commons, 1850.) In Pennsjdvania 
slavery was abolished in 1780. In New Jersey, it was provisionally abolished in 1784; all children born of a 
slave after 1804 are made free in 1820. In Massachusetts, ir was declared after the revolution, that slavery 
was virtually abolished by their constitution, (1780.) In 1784 and 1797 Connecticut provided for a gradual ex- 
tinction of slavery. In Rhode Island, after 1784, no person could be bom a slave. The ordinance of 1787 
forbid slavery in the Territory Northwest of the Ohio, but the census shows that the injunction was disobeyed. 
The constitutions of Vermont and New Hampshire, respectively, abolished slavery. In New York it was pro- 
visionally abolished in 1799, twenty-eight years ownership being allowed in slaves born after that date, and in 
1817 it was enacted that slavery was not to exist after ten years, or 1827.

The above table indicates the proportion which the slave population and the total colored 
population of each State bore to the whole population at the several periods named. Whilst 
the proportion has been increasing for the slaves in the Southern States generally, it has 
decreased in Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia and Missouri. In South Carolina 
from 43 per cent, it has become 57, and in Georgia from 35 per cent, it has become 42, &c, &c. 

In all of the States north of North Carolina, the proportion of total colored has been de- 
creasing, whilst in those South it has been generally increasing, except in Louisiana, where it 
has declined from 55 per cent, to 50. (See note chap. I.) In Kentucky and Missouri there 
has been a slight decline. In the North-west, with the exception of Ohio, there has also been 
a decline. 

2. Dwellings and Families. — These are not ascertained on the slave schedules. The facts, if 
known, would compare favorably with those of other classes in most moderate circumstances, 
and especially with the free colored. 

3. Sex. — There were 1,602,535 males, and 1,601, 778 female slaves in the United States in 
1850. The number in each of the States will be seen in this table. There was no distinction 
made of sex earlier than 1820.

* In Mississippi 578 slaves are returned without distinction as to age or sex. These have been distributed in 
the columns of slaves in the general proportion of the sexes, viz : 290 males, 288 females. 

t In the Census of 1820, 4,632 are returned as " all other persons, except Indians not taxed." These have 
been generally added to the " free colored," and they are so placed in this table — divided, however, in the 
general proportion of the sexes, viz : males, 2,232 ; females, 2,400.

When slavery existed in New England the females were largely in excess. In 1830 there 
were over three to one male. In the Middle States the males are always in excess. In the 
Southern States, since 1830, the male and female have been equal, or nearly so, and the same is 
true of the North-western States. In the South-west, since 1830, there is a small excess of 
males ; in the Territories, a large excess of females.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



[In infancy, and between 5 and 10, and 15 and 20, the females are generally in excess, the 
reverse of the case with the whites: for the two first periods between 10 and 15, the males are 
in excess of whites and slaves. To this there are some singular exceptions. For periods 
above TO, the females are generally in excess — strikingly so among the very aged. By another 
table the proportion of males and females at the different ages since 1820, is also shown. 
In 1850, the preponderance of aged females is worthy of note.]

5. Births, Marriages and Deaths. — The tables of Births in the Census, as previously ex- 
plained, are nothing more than those of the several classes of population under one year of 
age. There are slave children of that age, in Alabama, 8,110; in Arkansas, 1,169; in the 
District of Columbia, '71; in Delaware, 59; in Florida, 914; in Georgia, 9,619; in Kentucky, 
6,268; in Louisiana, 4,940; in Maryland, 2,446; in Mississippi, 7,399; in Missouri, 2,699; in 
North Carolina, 8,086; in South Carolina, 9,194; in Tennessee, 7,061; in Texas, 1,429; and in 
Virginia, 11,155. 

The Marriages of slaves are not noted in the Census. They take place, upon the average, 
much earlier than those of the whites or free colored, and are probably more productive than 
either. But no exact information on, an extended scale exists upon this point. 

The number of deaths of slaves reported in 1849-1850, was 52,566, or 1.64 per cent, of the 
whole slave population. This number is certainly too small, though from the facility of re- 
porting them, it approximates, perhaps, nearer to the truth than is the case with the free 
population.

6. Deaf and Dumb, Blind, Insane, and Idiotic. — The slaves were not separated in these par-

7. Nativities. — It is almost impossible to distinguish between the native born and foreign 
born slaves, and no facts -were collected upon this subject, except under the schedules of mor- 
tality. From these it appears that slaves, except to some extent Africans, were very generally 
considered of the nativity of the place of decease. As few slaves have been introduced into 
the country since 1808, and these chiefly into Florida, previously to 1819, under the Spanish 
rule, and into Louisiana, it will be necessary to look into the class over 60 years of age for 
the survivors of the original Africans. The whole number of slaves in 1850 over 60 years of 
age, was 114,752. Of these, no one familiar with the South would admit that more than 
8,000 or 10,000 were Africans. In Louisiana, in 1849-1850, 110 African slaves are reported to 
have died, out of a total of 6,083 deaths of slaves of all ages. In Virginia, few or no African 
deaths are mentioned. The ages of deceased Africans on the schedules generally range higher 
than sixty, often more than seventy, and in South Carolina as high as eighty, ninety, one 
hundred, and one hundred and ten. 

8. Occupations. — In no Census have the occupations of slaves been recorded. How many are 
employed as mechanics, how many as laborers, how many as house servants, cannot be 
known ; nor, more than approximately, how many on the different agricultural crops of the 
South. Deducting the slaves who are known to be residents of towns, and approximating for 
those towns that are unknown, it might be safe to say that 400,000 slaves are urban, and 
2,804.313 rural, and that of the latter class at least as many slaves will be employed as do- 
mestics as there are slave properties, which would leave about 2,500,000 slaves* to be directly 
employed in agriculture, including males and females, and persons of all ages. Slaves under 
ten and over sixty are seldom employed industrially. 

The total number of families holding slaves, by thecensus of 1850, was 347,525.1 On the 
average of 5.7 to a family there are about 2,000,000 persons in the relation of slave-owners, or 
about one-third of the whole white population of the slave States ; in South Carolina, Ala- 
bama, Mississippi and Louisiana, excluding the largest cities, one half of the whole population. 



♦These are distributed between the several great staples of the South, in something like the following pro- 
portions as near as can be judged, after a careful consideration of the subject, bearing in mind that large 
quantities of bread stuffs are produced in additiou. 

Hemp 60,000 2.4 per cent. 

Rice, 125,000 5.0 " " 

Sugar, 150,000 6.0 " " 

Tobacco, 350,000 14.0 « " 

Cotton, etc 1,815,000 72.6 « " 

2,500,000 100. 

t The number includes slave-hirers, but is exclusive of those who are interested conjointly with others in 



slave property, 
stated. 



The two will about balance each other, for the whole South, and leave the slave owners as

Where the party owns slaves in different counties or in different States, he "will be entered 
more than once. This will disturb the calculation very little, being only the case among the 
larger properties, and it will account for the fact that a smaller number of such properties are 
reported in some of the States than are known to exist, particularly in South Carolina, Vir- 
ginia and Louisiana. By the table it would seem that one-fifth of the properties are in a 
single slave, and nearly one-half in less than five slaves.* 



CHAPTER VI. 

AGGBEGATE POPULATION. 



Having given in Chapter Second the Aggregate Population of the United States at all of the 
Census periods, the formation and relation of States and Territories, the density of popu 
lation, &c, and, in subsequent Chapters, the White, Free Colored and Slave Population in 
detail, it will be in order now to include such remarks and tables as were not conveniently 
reducible under either of the several Chapters. 

According to the ratio of increase from Census to Census, divided for the particular years 
so as to represent correctly the per centages for the lesser and greater population which is in- 
creasing, a table has been prepared showing the population of the United States at each year 
since 1790. The ratio of increase from 1840 to 1850 is assumed for the next decade.f 

* The occupation and nativities of slave-holders were not taken off. An experiment in one southern town, 
gave accountants, barbers, bakers, blacksmiths, builders, butchers, carpenters, draymen, grocers, painters, 
plasterers, saddlers, tailors, tinners, etc., 32 out of a total of 250 holders, and 115 natives of free States (at 
home and abroad, 49 being foreign,) out of the same total of 250. 

f For an explanation of the principle upon which such a table may be constructed, see Prof. Tucker. " Pro- 
gress of the United States,'' p. 107. By starting with the population of 1790 as a basis, which was 3.929,827, 
and adding three per cent, tor every year, making 4.047,721 for 1791 ; 4,169,152 for 1792, and so on for every 
year until 1850. Mr. Darby, the well known geographer, arrived at results, which when compared with the 
particular censi s years, showed as follows :

2. Families and Dwellings. — A family in the Census, is either one person living separately in 
a house or part of a house, and providing for him or herself, or several persons living together 
in a house upon one common means of support, and distinct from others in similar circum- 
stances. A widow living alone, and separately providing for herself, or two hundred indi- 
viduals living together and provided for by a common head, constitute a family. S-o of the 
inmates of a hotel, jail, hospital, tire There were 3,593,195 such families among the white 
and free colored population in 1850. 

A Dicelling, in the Census, embraces separate inhabited tenements, containing one or more 
families under one roof. Where several tenements are in one block, with walls either of brick 
or wood to divide them, they are considered as separate houses. Without such divisions 
they are one house. If the house be partly used for a store or shop, it is a dwelling, though 
not if so used wholly. Jails, hotels, penitentiaries, tc, are B Dwellings." The total number 
of Dwellings in the States is given below. (See Table XCIX.) The number of houses, in- 
cluding stores, shops, kc, untenanted or unfinished buildings cannot be stated, nor have the 
dwellings been ascertained for any earlier census, though the returns were sufficient for the 
purpose.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



By reference to table XCIX, it will be perceived that there are eighteen families to every 
hundred white and free colored persons in the Union, or two families to every eleven, the ratio 
between the States varying from 17.21 families to a hundred persons in Alabama, to 26.5 in 
California. Comparing the different sections with each other, we have

Upon the average for the Union, there are 16.82 houses for every 100 white and free colored 
persons, or a little less than one house to every six persons, the ratio between the States 
varying from 15.17 dwellings to every 100 persons in Rhode Island to 25.6 in California. The 
proportion of families to dwellings in the Union is as 107.01 to 100. In Utah and Oregon 
there is one dwelling to every family; in Louisiana 100 to every 110; in Connecticut 100 to 
114; in Massachusetts and Rhode Island 100 to 126, &c. &c. 

There were 2,260,802 families in Great Britain exclusively of Ireland, in 1801, or 1 family 
to every 4.64 persons ; in 1851 4,312,388, or 1 family to every 4.83 persons. In the interval 
2,051,586 new families were started. The average number of persons to a family was as fol- 
lows in the following countries.

The average number of persons to each dwelling in Ireland, in 1851, was 6.35; and in Bel- 
gium in 1846, 5.42. 

The number of dwellings in Ireland in 1851 is stated at 1,047,735, making the total for thqfr 
British empire, including the islands, 4,717,172. Adding the dwellings of the slave popula- 
tion, at least, on the average, as good as those of the operative classes of Europe, and estima- 
ting one dwelling for six slaves, the total dwellings in the United States will be 4,197,914. 
By comparison, one dwelling to every 5.82 persons in Great Britain, and one to every 5.52 
persons in the United States.* 

* [n Boston, according to the State Census of 1845, there were 19,175 families to 10,812 houses. Of these, 
3,361 were owned by the occupant, and 7,451 not owned by the occupant; 6,268 of these houses were occu- 
pied by one family each ; 2,771 by two families ; 902 by three ; 419 by four; 174 by five ; 105 by six, and the 
remainder by more than six families. The average for the city was one house to 1.77 families, and one family 
to 5.09 persons. The number of vacant houses at the same time, was 518, and the number building 559. 

Paris, in 1835 contained 50,476 houses, and 1,106,891 persons, or 22 persons and four or five families to a 
house. In London, in 1851, there were 2,352,236 persons, and 305,933 houses, or 17 families to 10 houses. 

In Liverpool in 1851 there were 47,271 families and 35,293 houses. In 1847, in the same city, 30,000 persona 
dwelt in cellars, but since that period police regulations have greatly reduced the number. In Manchester, in 
1851, there were 44,621 families, and 36,701 houses. The "house" in England includes all dwellings isolated

and separated by party walls, and in which the occupant has the exclusive use of the entrance hall and stairs. 
In Scotland, the flats containing as many habitations as stories, entered by common stairs, have generally, 
until 1851 been considered as separate houses. In that year the English rule was applied to them. 

In Great Britain the family includes those who use the same kitchen and board together. A lodger who does 
not board in the house in which he lived, is considered a family. In 1851 "occupier" was substituted for 
a family." defined to be, 1st, a resident owner, or 2nd, a person who had paid rent, whether (3d) as a lodger 
for any distinct apartment, or floor, or the whole house. The rule, however, was not adhered to, and family 
in that census corresponds with the previous one. 

Of 67,609 families in England in 1837, taken in order, 41,916 were under the head of "'husband and wife," 
10.854 under " widow or widower,-' 5 14,399 under "bachelor or spinster." Of 42.203 having at head "husband 
and wife," 11,947 had no children, 8,750 one child each, 7.376 two children, 5.611 three children, 4,027 four 
children. 2,348 rive children, 1,276 six children, 573 seven children, 210 eisht, 66 nine, 14 ten, 5 eleven, and 1 
twelve children. In 2,017 public institutions or families, there were 295.856 persons, to wit: barracks, 53.933; 
workhouses, 131,582 ; prisons, males 24,593, females 6,356, total, 30,959 ; lunatic asylums, 21.004 ; hospitals, 
11,647 ; asylums and other charitable institutions, 46,731. 

* A writer in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences for July, 1854. remarks that nine months after 
the prevalence of cholera in Philadelphia there was a remarkable diminution in the proportion of male births, 
and that subsequent investigations lead to the conclusion that disease, exhausting labor, meagre diet, impure 
air, intemperance, and other social evils exert depressing influences upon the number of male births. He adds 
his belief that all measures tending to promote the health and welfare of a population, whilst serving immedi- 
ately to increase its capacities for profitable labor, tend also to promote the multiplication of the male sex. 
Thus in England, the excess of male births, is but 5 per cent.; in France and Prussia, 6 per cent.; in Phila- 
delphia, 7 per cent.; and in Kentucky, by its Registration report, 12 1-2 per cent.; in Massachusetts in the 
cities and towns, it is but 6 per cent., though reaching 9 per cent, among the agricultural population. Pro- 
fessor Tucker suggests as a query whether the preponderance of male births be an original provision, or 
whether the greater vitality of that sex is not the cause of a less number being still-born or perishing in delivery.

"Whilst the slaves have much more than their ratio of the dependent class of 15 and under, 
and more than their proportion of the whole supported class, including thoSe below 15 and 
above 60, their ratio of the effective class is less than that either of the whites or free colored. 
The presumption here is that those in the several conditions under 15 who are industrially 
engaged, are about equal. The proportion is no doubt much larger among the slaves. The 
proportion of free colored above 60 is greater than that of the whites or slaves or total.

The average age of the different classes of population in 1850, and the age which divides 
the whole number Gf each about equally are given below. The results are sufficiently curious. 
In 1790 and 1800 the age of 16 nearly divided the whites. The average age of the slave3 
shows most favorably and that of the free colored least.

t The number of persons living in the United States who were here when the Declaration of Indepen- 
dence was signed, cannot much exceed 20.000. It must consist of those now over 75 years of age, less the 
number of persons who have come into the country since 1775 and have now reached that age. By the tables 
of survivorship a nearer approximation may be obtained.

5. Births, Marriages and Deaths. — The ratio of Births, in the table on another page, shows 2.15 
in the Union to every 100 free persons, or one birth to every thirty-six persons, or very nearly 
the same number that is given in the Massachusetts Registry reports for that State on the 
average of the years 1849-51, yet the Census shows for Massachusetts but one birth to every 
42 persons in 1850. In Great Britain for the five years 1839-43, the average was one birth to 
31 persons, in France one in 35, in Russia one in 36, in Prussia and Austria one in 26, in Bos- 
ton one in 2T. 

Correcting the number of births by reference as explained before to the mortality tables, &o, 
the average for the United States would be about one birth to every 33 persons, a number 
intermediate oetween that of France and Great Britain, whilst without doubt it should be 
greater than either. 

The ratio of Marriages is very nearly one person married to every two hundred persons, 
varying between the States from one to 316 as in Delaware, one to 150 as in New Mexico, 
or one to 192 as in Massachusetts, a sufficient proof of the incompleteness of the returns. 
The Massachusetts Registry for 184&-51 gives one in 102 for the State, and in Boston one in 
64. In England there is one marriage to every 130 inhabitants, in France and Austria one in 
123, in Prussia one in 110. The actual proportion in the United States cannot differ much 
from that of Massachusetts, and is no doubt larger. The number returned as married is twice 
the number of marriages, less those who have married and died, or removed in the year, not 
taken into account 

It will be seen by the table which follows, that there is but one death reported for every 
seventy-two persons in the Union, and that for the States the ratio varies from one in 283, 
as in Oregon, to one in 102, as in California, or one in 44, as in Louisiana. The Massachu- 
setts reports show for 1849-50-51 one in fifty-three against one in fifty-one in the census — 
a near approximation. 



*The ages which were returned in the census "unknown," are disposed of in something like the following 
manner. One-tenth to the class under 10 years ; one-tenth to those between 10 and 20 ; one-tenth to those 
between 20 and 35 ; five and a half-tenths to those between 35 and 50, as in this class they are far more apt 
to occur; one-tenth between 50 and 80 ; one-twentieth to those between 80 and 100. In the 30,131 ascertained 
cases, there were 283 mulattoes, of whom only five exceeded 61 years of age, or 1 in 56. Out of 974 blacks, 
34 exceeded that age, or 1 in 28. Of 28,874 whites, 1,475 or 1 in 19 exceeded the same age. No white ex- 
ceeded 100, and only 23 exceeded 90. No mulatto exceeded 77, though two blacks were 78 ; four 80 ; two 85 ; 
one 88 ; one 91 ; one 120. The proportion of mulattoes and blacks under 10 was very nearly if not quite equal, 
being about 30 per cent., and the whites about 27 per cent, of the whole. 

The preponderance of those at the ages .10, 15, 20, 25, 30, &c. is notable ; evidencing that approximations 
assume round numbers, and that a disposition exists with persons also to assume them in returning their ages. 
The same will be found in the French Census of 1851, which gave a total of 35,783,170, of whom 29,634 were 
unknown. Under 1 year, 655,271 ; of 4 years, 642,381; 5 years, 653,830 ; 6 years, 673,748 ; 10 years, 661,359; 
19 years, 578,956 ; 20 years, 618,230 ; 21, 555,893 ; 29, 495,711 ; 30, 690,638 ; 31, 467,219 ; 39, 420,327 ; 40, 665,939 ; 
41,401,550; 49,356,354; 50,591,861; 51,357,216; 59,237.137; 60,403.655; 61, 219,118; 70. 219.954; 80. 62,794 ; 
90, 5,257; 95, 1,228; 100, 180; over 100, 102.

The true number of Deaths in the Union for 1850, considering it a sickly year, could not 
have fallen short of one in every fifty persons for all classes, which would swell the total 
deaths of the census from 323,272 to 463,839.

In 1851 the still-born, not included in the detail, numbered 527. The deaths are 
published by counties in twelve classes, and the results for twelve years compared. The 
average ages of the different professions dying, are also classified; as for example, agricul- 
turists, laborers, mechanics, merchants, paupers, professional men*, public men, seamen, fe- 
males, &c. 

The English system of registration was established in 1836, and annual reports have been 
regularly published. They are considered to be so accurate that it is said " the marriage 
returns point out periods of prosperity little less distinctly than the funds measure the 
hopes and fears of the money market." In Massachusetts the system was organized in 1842, 
in New York in 1847, the first report being published in 1848 ; in New Jersey, 1848-51; 
in Connecticut in 1848, and three reports are published; in New Hampshire in 1849-51; in 
Pennsylvania and Kentucky in 1852. The reports of most of these States have been com- 
pared, and they resemble generally those of Massachusetts, which are especially admirable. It

would be well if the tables for the several States followed one uniform standard. Those which 
are named are the only States, it is believed, that have registry systems in operation, although 
others are preparing to follow. In Louisiana an unsuccessful experiment was made. The 
matter is now before the legislature of South Carolina. The National Medical Convention 
has frequently and earnestly recommended registration systems to all of the States. In 
many of the large cities there are annual reports of diseases and deaths made up by the Boards 
of Health, which embody a vast amount of valuable statistical matter. Those for Charleston, 
Savannah, New Orleans, Mobile, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, have been collected 
in the office.* 

Dr. E. H. Barton, of New Orleans, in a report to the American Medical Association in 1852, 
has analyzed with great care the mortality returns of the Census for the States of Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, illustrating them with many most interesting sanitary charts 
and maps. He has subsequently been pursuing the subject, associated with Dr. Axson and 
others, with characteristic zeal, at the instance of the municipal authorities of the city. 
Dr. Barton admits the imperfections of the returns, but thinks them valuable, notwithstanding, 
for reference, and that they are much nearer correct in the country than in the cities. His 
totals of deaths differ slightly from those in the Census which were afterwards corrected.^

* Mr. Shattuck who prepared the Report in 1850 of the Commissioners appointed by the legislature of Mas- 
sachusetts, under a resolution relating to a sanitary survey of that State, introduces twelve considerations upon 
the subject of vital statistics, too valuable and instructive to be omitied in this place. 

" The following principles maybe considered as settled ; though we have not space in this connection to 
illustrate them fully. They should govern all those who make sanitary surveys of different places or populations. 

" 1st. That a uniform law of mortality exists, which destroys more persons at one age than at another, in 
all other circumstances exactly similar, and that this is modified in its operation in a healthy and in an un- 
healthy locality, only by its being less stringently regarded in the one than in the other. 

"2nd. That the generative power and ability to produce a healthy child at marriage, and the number of mar- 
ried persons living in the procreative ages, combined with other personal circumstances ; and hence arises 
the sanitary importance of ascertaining in a census, as a characteristic of the population, the number of the 
married at different ages, and of recording each marriage and the age at marriage. 

" 3d. That when the number of births is great, the number of deaths is proportionally great, and the average 
age at death proportionally low ; and that an excessive production of life is one of the causes, not conse- 
quences of great mortality ; and hence the number of births is a necessary element in estimating the sanitary 
condition of a population. 

" 4th. That the average age at death, as well as the aggregate number of a population out of the whole of 
which one dies annually, though interesting as a characteristic of the population, is a fallacious test of its 
sanitary condition ; and cannoube employed alone, for that purpose, without leading to serious errors. It ean 
be applied as an accurate test only when the ages of the living inhabitants compared, are alike. 

"5th. That selecting a class of the population, such as the professional men, the tradesmen, the laborers, the 
rich or the poor, and giving their average age, or the average number of years of life that either live, less than 
the others, or that either lose more than the others, as a test of the sanitary condition of the class, may mislead 
the inquirer, and cannot be relied upon as an accurate test. 

" 6th. That the information concerning the rate of mortality supposed to have prevailed in past ages, when 
the calculations have been made upon the erroneous basis mentioned in the last two conclusions, cannot be 
taken as an exact test for comparison with the present age, without some allowance of error. Few observa- 
tions concerning the living or the dead were made with accuracy in the olden times. 

"7th. That the only accurate tests of measurement for one place, are those founded on a joint comparison 
of the number of persons living at each age, with the number of deaths at the same age ; or for different plaees,

a comparison of the same facts regarding the population of the same ages in both "places ; or the same popula- 
tion in two places, supposing it to be removed from one place to the other. 

" 6th. That in estimating the effects of immigration on the sanitary condition of a population, the difference 
both between the ages of those who come in and those who go out, and the ages of the permanent population 
must always be considered. Other circumstances being equal, a difference in this respect will produce a dif- 
ferent rate of the whole mortality. 

"9th. The same joint comparison should be made separately of the ages of the living and the ages at death 
of all who die, by each disease ; in each season of the year ; of each sex ; of each occupation ; and of those 
characterized by other circumstances. The number as influenced by either of these circumstances, will be 
increased or diminished in proportion as more or less are found of one age more than of another. For this 
purpose a variety of tables might be constructed to exhibit the facts in condensed forms. 

" 10. That an accurate enumeration of the number, ages, &.c, birth, even" marriage, and even - death, with 
all the information desired relating to each, are absolutely essential as the foundation of every estimation of 
the sanitary condition of a population; and a sanitary survey, where this is wanting, can be of litjle value. 
1 " 11th. That for all practical purposes, as means of comparison, the living and the dead may beldivided as 
to the ages, into decennial periods, or periods of ten years each, for those over twenty ; into quinquennial pe- 
riods, or periods of five years each, for those under twenty, and into each year of life for those under five 
j years. This admirable division has been adopted in England. For special purposes three divisions 
should be made: of those under 15, of those between 15 and 60, and of those over 60, as the dependent 
the productive, and the aged classes. The division sometimes made between those under 20, and over 20, 
as "boys and girls," and "men and women;" or as "children and adults," is indefinite, unmeaning, and 
useless ; as are also the ages 4, 8, 14, 16, 21 and 45, which have been sometimes used as dividing points. 
j " 12th. That to secure such uniformity at different places and at different times, in the abstracts of the facts 
concerning the living inhabitants, and the dead, that each may be accurately compared together, both should 
be made under the superintendence of one agency, and that agency should be the General Board of Health."

Should the mortality statistics of the Census be printed, (and they have been asked for 
by medical men, societies and associations in every part of the Union,) some very useful 
deductions could be made from them. The returns are sufficient to frame tables similar

In connection with the mortality statistics of this report, and with a view to their comparison more fully 
with those prepared and published annually in the several large cities, the following statistics are appended. 

In Boston, according to the report of the Sanitary Commission, the number of deaths of persons under five 
years of age during a period of nine years, was 11,705, being nine per cent, annually of the total population of 
that age; of persons aged from five to ten years, 1,312 or 1.28 per cent.; from ten to 15 years, 633, or 0.72 per 
cent.; from fifteen to twenty, 738, or 0.74 per cent.; from twenty to thirty, 3,303, or 1.24 per cent.; from thirty 
to forty, 2,917, or 1.62 per cent.; from forty to fifty, 1,948, or 2.15 per cent.; from fifty to sixty, 1,273, or 2.97 per 
cent.; from sixty to seventy, 1,057, or 4.75 per cent.; from seventy to eighty, 787, or 9.78 per cent.; from eighty

In New Orleans the Board of Health reported for the year preceding June, 1850, 7,265 deaths against 3.641 
reported m the census. The following table will show the ages and color of those dying in 1849 and 1850 at 
New Orleans. Lafayette has since been incorporated with the city. The deaths in 1850 were regularly 
returned only in part! About 1,000 were mentioned by the marshal without any particulars, and were not 
therefore included in the mortality table.

A large part of the mortality of New Orleans is among those who are born in other States or in forei?n 
countries. This may be seen, in some measure, by the report of the Charity Hospital, which shows in 1S50, 
tbe admission of only 264 Louisianians out of a total of 18.476 admissions ! 395 were from New York, 110 
from Massachusetts, and among the others, every State in the Union is represented. The tocal born in the 
United States was but 1,774; in foreign countries, 16,598. Of the foreigners, 11,13.2 were Irish ; about 2,500

The ages and other facts relating to the parents on both sides of the children born, distin- 
guishing black from mulatto, the ages, &c. of persons married, male and female, the ages and 
sex, &c. of those who have died, are all very important considerations in the view of vital 
statisticians. Most of these could be ascertained with some labor, from the Census returns, 
but no attempt was made to do so when the population results were being aggregated in the 

Germans, and 852 French. The reports of the hospital since 1839 show the following figures. It will be seen 
that in 1848, 11,650 out of 11,945, were persons who had not been three years in New Orleans. Th^table was 
prepared by Dr. Simonds. 

Abstract of the Annual Reports of the Oliarity Hospital of New Orleans, for the years 1839 to 

1850, inclusive.

Dr. Simonds makes the following calculation of the proportion of deaths to 100 persons. In Boston, for 39 
years, from 1811 to 1849, 2.45~ per cent.; in Lowell, for 13 vears, from 1836 to 1848, 2.119 per cent.; in New 
York, for 33 years, from 1807 to 1840, 2.551 per cent.; in Baltimore, for 14 years, from 1836 to 1849, 2.491 per 
cent.; in Charleston, for 27 years, from 1822 to 1848, 2.482 per cent, for the whites, 2.645 per cent, for the 
blacks, and 2.579 for all classes ; in Savannah, for 8 years, from 1840 to 1847, 4.161 per cent.; in New Orleans, 
for four and one-half years, from 1846 to 1850, 8.101 per cent.; in Massachusetts, in 1847 and 1848, 1.59 per cent.; 
in twelve counties of England, 1.93 per cent.; in twenty-six cities of England, 2.72 per cent.; in London the 
mean rate is 2.53 per cent.; in Liverpool the mean rate is 3.34 per cent., and in 1850 it was 2.73 per cent.; in 
Manchester, the mean rate is 3.48 per cent. The estimate for Savannah is calculated upon a small number of 
vears, and must be too high. The same may be said of New Orleans, but deducting cholera, it would be 
5,719. 

Dr. Barton, in Fenner's " Southern Medical Statistics," Vol. I. p. 85, shows that the proportion dying from all 
pulmonary diseases is, in Philadelphia, 28.57 per cent.; in New York, 28.08 per cent.; in Havana, "25.07 per 
cent.; in Boston, 23.97 per cent.; in Baltimore, 23.33 per cent.; in Charleston, 22.73 per cent.; in the city of 
Mexico, 16.76 per cent.; in Norfolk, Va., 12.78 per cent.; and in New Orleans, 13.87 per cent. 

Another calculation has lately been made of the mortality of the several cities named, from reports run- 
ning back five to thirty years, showing the following results. The figures for New Orleans are too high, as 
they include years of large mortality. Exclusively of the transient and foreign population, New Orleans will 
compare favorably with any Western city. In Charleston, the deaths are estimated as one to 48; in Boston, 
as one to 46 ; in Philadelphia, one to 45; in Baltimore, one to 43 ; in Cincinnati, one to 35 ; in New York, or»o 
to 34 ; in New Orleans one to 19. 

In Memphis in 1851, there were 717 deaths ; in 1852, 705 $ in 1853, 412. The population in 1853 was 12,000.

As an evidence of the extraordinary number of marriages of natives of different States, 
which are shown by the census, it may be stated that in one town in Mississippi, taken at 
random, out of 548 families the male and female of 225 were from different States, domestic or 
foreign, 61 were natives of non-slaveholding States intermarried with those of slaveholding, 
and 58 of natives with foreigners.

6. Deaf and Dumb, Blind, Insane and Idiotic. — The aggregate number of persons embraced 
within all of these classes, by the Census of 1850, was 50,994, being one for every 460 persons, 
or one deaf and dumb for every 2,365, and one blind tor every 2,368. Some years ago, M. 
Quetelet computed the proportion of deaf and dumb for Belgium, at one in 2,226; in Great 
Britain, at one in 1,539 ; in Italy at one in 1,539; and in Europe generally at one in 1,414. 
For the blind, his proportions were, in Belgium, one in 998 ; in Prussia, one in 800,; in France, 
one in 1,600 ; in Saxony, one in 1,666 ; and in Europe generally, one in 1,000.* 

* In Belgium, in 1835, there were 1,746 deaf and dumb, of whom 963 were males, and 783 females. There 
were 3,892 Blind, of whom 2,462 were males, and 1,430 females. The proportion of Deaf and Dumb, to the 
total population was as 1 to 2,226. The proportion of Blind to the total population was as 1 to 998. Of the 
1,746 Deaf and Dumb, 1,376 were afflicted from birth, and 370 bv disease or accident; 373 were inhabitants of 
cities, and 1,373 of rural districts. Of the number of 3,892 Blind, 256 had been blind from birth, 908 were 
military men, afflicted with an opthalmia peculiar to their profession, and 2,728 blind from other causes. 
1,196 were from cities, and 2,696 from rural districts.

By the annexed table, the nativities of the deaf and dumb will be seen, showing that the 
foreign born, who constitute less than an eighth of the white and free colored, furnish less 
than one-eleventh of the whole number. Such persons are not likely to be found among the 
immigrating; class.

* Dr. Peet, in the Beport of the New York Deaf and Dumb Asylum, argues that the number returned by the 
eensus is short of the fact from the unwillingness often of families to confess. Idiots are frequently in popular 
use called dumb. Many reported deaf, he thinks, are also dumb, and such of them as are under 20 years of 
age, would in general be subjects for an asylum. The State Census of Alabama for 1850, gives 557 insane of 
the whites, showing that the idiotic are confounded with them. In fact the distinction in the United States 
Census between the two classes cannot be considered reliable, and it would be better to class them together 
as in 1840. The State Census of 1853 of Illinois, gives the names of 500 mutes. 

t Of the Deaf and Dumb, there were returned as " nativity unknown," one person in each of the States of 
Arkansas, Iowa, Maine, South Carolina and Wisconsin ; two persons in each of the States of Connecticut, 
Maryland, Michigan and Tennessee; four persons in Massachusetts; rive persons in New York ; six persons 
each in Indiana, Missouri and Ohio, and eighty persons in the State of Illinois. 

X Of the Blind, the nativity was unknown of one person in each of the Stftes of Arkansas, Louisiana, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin ; of two persons each in 
Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia ; of three persons in Vermont ; of four persons each in Alabama. Mis- 
souri, Ohio and Tennessee; of six persons each in Connecticut and Indiana; of eight in New York and 
twenty-two in Illinois.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



The proportions in the several States and Territories, have been calculated in table GXV. 
For all classes the mean of the last three Census' shows one affected person to every 951 
whites in the slaveholding States, and one to 1,060 in the other States ; one to every 1,444 
colored in the slaveholding States, and one to 503 colored in the non-slaveholding.* 

7. Nativities. — As before remarked, 2,240,535 white and 4,067 free colored persons are given 
by the census of 1850 as of foreign birth, and 17,279,875 whites and 428,424 free colored as 
of native birth. Of the native population, 13,103,650 still reside in, and 4,176,225 reside out 
of the States in which they were born. The English census is more complete, and separates 
even those residing in or out of their native counties. Connecticut, South Carolina and Ver- 
mont have more than half as many native born residing in other States, as remain at home. 
North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, have nearly one-half; Massachusetts, Mary- 
land and New Jersey, about one-third. The largest proportion of foreigners is in Wisconsin 
and Minnesota being about one- third of the total population. The least proportion is in 
North Carolina, being one to 229 native born ; in South Carolina one to 32 ; Arkansas one 
to 98 ; and in Mississippi, one to 62.

The total number of those residing in the States of their birth is 13,624,897; of those re- 
siding out of the States of their birth 4,112,681, and the total of those born and resident in the 
United States is 11,131,5*18. The total native and foreign population is 19,948,41 t 7; the total 
unknown 39,146; and the total including unknown 19,98*7,563, excluding slaves. 

Entering more into detail and giving the specific places of birth for each of the above 
classes of population, some most interesting facts will be obtained. The tables which are 
adopted, do not in this case separate the white and free colored, and the3 r are the results of 
a first examination. If the ages of persons born in and those born out of the State of resi- 
dence were ascertained, some useful facts bearing upon the value and probability of life 
would result. 



* Of persons that are at the same time deaf, dumb and blind, there is one each in Massachusetts, Georgia, 
Florida and Tennessee ; two in Ohio, and four in Virginia. Of those deaf and blind there is one each in

AGGREGATE POPULATION. 119 

It appears there were in 1850 within the United States, 961,719 persons born in Ireland; 
278,675, in England; 70,550 in Scotland; 29,868 in Wales, making a total for Great Britain 
and Ireland of 1,340,812, which is considerably more than half of the total foreign born resi- 
dents of the country. If British America be added (147,711) there will be a total of 1,488,523, 
which is two-thirds of the total foreign born. From France there are 54,069 ; from Prussia, 
10,549; from the rest of Germany, 573.225: from Austria, 946; from Switzerland, 13,358; 
from Norway, 12,678; from Holland, 9,848; from Sweden, 3,559; from Spain, 3.113; from 
Italy, 3,645; from the West Indies, 5,772; from Denmark, 1,838; from Belgium, 1,313; from 
Russia, 1,414; from Portugal, 1,274; from China, 758; from the Sandwich Islands, 588 ; from 
Mexico, 13,317 ; from South America, 1,543. 

The tables of specific places of birth differ from those which were subsequently made out 
in the office for the whites and free colored separately, (embraced in those chapters, and in- 
tended to show the native and foreign born without distinction of State or country) after a 
careful examination. As both sets of tables are published in this volume, the discrepancy 
between them can be seen. In examining the names of many millions of persons, at distinct 
times, and by different persons, such discrepancies are to be expected. 

It is probable that the number of foreign born inhabitants of the United States is slightly 
overrated in the census, and that young children of foreigners though born in the country, 
are to some extent included. Had the ages of foreigners been aggregated from the returns 
separately from the native, it would be easy to settle the question as well as to frame some 
other tables of great interest When the census of 1850 was taken, there could not have 
been in the United States more than a certain number of foreign born children under 5 years 
of age. This number is ascertained by the returns of the State Department, giving the ages 
of the immigrants. Making deductions for mortality, it could be said approximately how 
many under 5 years of age survived in 1850, and any considerable difference on the returns 
would be evidence of error. A partial examination seems to indicate such a disproportion of 
very young children. Children of foreigners are apt to be regarded as of the nativities of 
the parents. Families consider themselves, or are considered entirely as German, Irish, &c., 
though embracing some children actually born in the country. A careless or hasty enume- 
rator would stand in no small danger of committing errors, and even with the most careful, 
they could not on this account, be easily guarded against. When the statistics of mortality 
are examined an opportunity will be given of investigating the subject more fully. The re- 
turns show of foreign born families having native children the following: Franklin county, 
Kentucky, 25 ; Pike and Potter, Pennsylvania, 35 ; Bristol, Kent and Washington, R. Island, 
57; Allegan, Barry, Berrian and Branch, of Michigan, 189; Abbeville, Anderson, Barnwell, 
Beaufort, Charleston, Marion and Marlborough, S. Carolina, 1,124; E. Feliciana, Ouachita, 
Point Coupee, Plaquemines, Rapides, Louisiana, 188 ; Erie, Pennsylvania, 475. 

Estimating the survivors in 1850 of the foreigners who had arrived in the United States 
since the census of 1790 upon the principle of the English life tables, and making the necessary 
allowance for the less proportion of the old and very young among them, and for re-emigra- 
tion, etc., their number is stated in the abstract of the census published in 1853, p. 15, at 
2,460,000. From this, a deduction is then made of ten per cent, on account of the greater 
mortality of emigrants and their lower expectation of life, which brings the actual survivors 
very nearly to the figures of the census. The deduction of ten per cent, seems hardly suffi- 
cient, and does not accord with the deductions that are generally made in the reasonings of 
vital statisticians.* It would be safer to assume 15 per cent, than 10, which would reduce the 
survivors to a little more than 2,000,000. To this add 50 per cent for the living descendants 
of foreigners who have come into the country since 1790, (observing that nearly four-fifths 
of the number have arrived since 1830, and could not have both children and grand children 
born in the country, and more than half have arrived since 1840, and must have had com- 
paratively few native born children, it would not be safe to add any more,) and the num- 
ber of foreigners and their descendants in 1853 is not likely to exceed 3,000,000 or 3.200.000. 

Taking two States least affected by immigration, New Hampshire and North Carolina, Dr. 
Jarvis supposes for argument, that the descendants of the females there in 1800, surviving 
to 1850, would bear the same ratio to their numbers as the descendants of the foreign females 
who were there in 1800, &c, viz. that 1,000 females alive in those States in 1810, would have 
as many descendants alive in 1850 as 1,000 foreign females who were there in 1810, &c. Upon 
this basis he frames the following table, 

* Dr. Jarvis thinks the deduction of 10 per cent, too small. Mr. Meech who made the calculation of 
2,460,000, says in a note, January 20th, 1854. " I have lately re-computed the number of survivors of the emi- 
gration of 1790 and 1650, with some slight alterations since suggested, but the final number is substantially the 
same, or upwards of 2,400,000. It may seem too great, but there is certainly no mistake in the calculation, 
besides the reduction for extra deaths, there are others which would reduce it to the census number, such as 
returned, &c." 

Tables of survivorship, or life tables, are calculated upon the following principle. From an extensive re- 
gister of births and deaths, let a large number, as 10.000 infants be taken and traced through the whole course 
of their lives, determining how many are alive at the end of each year. Thus, according to the Carlisle 
Table of 10,000 infants born at the same epoch, only 8,461 would be living at the end of the first year, 7,779 at the 
end of the second year, and so on as exhibited in a column styled " number living." The series terminates 
at 105 years, the limiting age in this case. The column of " annual deaths" exhibits the difference of the 
numbers in the first column. Of 4,000 persons living at the age of 56, for example, 76 die in the ensuing year. 

From the number living is deducted the expectation of life or its average duration after any given age, thus, 
at the age of 15 the average future life time is 45 years, &c. For purposes of reference the Carlisle Table is in- 
serted entire. There is also a Swedish Tabl« in use, and also one of British annuitants.

" In this calculation, no allowance is made for the time which the immigrants may have 
been here previous to the decenninal year. Those who arrived between 1840 and 1850 ave 
raged a residence of 3.9 years previous to the last date. Perhaps so much should be added to 
each of the above periods, except the last, which should be 3.9 instead of 5, and perhaps 
some allowance should be made for the greater proportion of immigrant females being of a 
marriageable and productive age, than the females of these States, (being 203 per 1,000 of all, 
while in New Hampshire and North Carolina they were 145 per 1,000 of all of both sexes.) On 
the other hand, allowance should be made for the great proportion of deaths among foreigners 
and their children, and also for the greater delay of their marriage in a new and strange 
country. The emigration from North Carolina and New Hampshire is balanced, in part, by 
the immigration into those States, and in part, by the foreigners that return or otherwise pass 
out of the country." 

Professor Tucker, calculated, after a very laborious analysis, the number of foreigners and 
their descendants to be above, one million in 1840. Dr. Chickering's estimate, 184? or 1848, 
reaches as high as 3,943,6*73, and a statement calculated upon his principles but upon different 
data, was inserted in the Abstract, p. 133, making the total to 1850, 4,304,416. The objections 
to the course of reasoning by which these figures were obtained, are ably set forth in letters 
from Dr. Jarvis to the Census Office, from which some extracts are given in the notes, without 
the benefit however of his revision.*

were born and survived to 1810, and to the decennial year next after their arrival survived to 1850, for these too 
are included in the total. On this supposition there had been no death of foreigners since their arrival in this 
country through 60 years up to 1850. And also if a child of a foreigner born between 1790 and 1810, survived 
to 1810, he lived 40 years longer. Those born between 1810 and 1820, alive in 1820, lived 30 years longer. 
Those born between 1820 and 1830, alive in 1830, lived 20 years longer, and if between 1830 and 1840 and alive 
in 1840, lived 10 years longer. The only chance given for a foreigner or his children to die, was between the 
time of his birth and the next decennial year. If he passed that he succeeded almost to immortality on 
earth, at least to a life lasting to the middle of this century. 

" This matter of increase of foreigners by birth, is worth a little further examination. The production or 
natural increase must be in ratio of the number of the females of the productive age, and not to the whole 
number of the people. Foreigners generally intermarry with each other, so far as we have means of observa- 
tion ; there are comparatively few instances of natives and aliens uniting together, so few are these that they 
do not militate with the general rule. With the Irish especially, this rule is almost universal, and with all it 
will be safe to say that there are no more marriages of foreigners than there are foreign marriageable females, 
the exceptions are so rare as not to destroy any extensive calculation made in regard to it. Immigration brings 
a larger proportion of males. In 1847 the males were 139,491, and females 99,325, being in the ratio of 
583 males, and 417' females per 1,000 of all. The females between 20 and 40 years old were 49 per cent, of their 
own sex, and 203 per 1,000 of both sexes. It is manifest that foreigners are not only subject to the same law 
of mortality with the natives, but they fall more readily beneath the diseases, and the wasting scourges of the 
land, than those who are born here. We well know that in New Orleans the mortality is in a far greater 
ratio among the foreigners than among our own people, from Yellow Fever, Cholera, &c. In the epidemic of 
1841, the deaths were, foreign 1,355, natives 289. Another report which I find at this moment, states their 
nativity to have been, United States 288, foreign countries 1,055, unknown 298. In another epidemic there 
were 147 native and 452 foreign. In 1847 the deaths were, natives of the United States 240, other countries, 
1,922. The deaths in 1849, natives of the United States, 491, foreign, 2,139, unknown, 2,086. I do not know 
the proportion of native and foreign population in New Orleans, but it cannot show a ratio like this, can it? 
(See mortality statistics of this volume.) In Boston, the mortality during the years 1849, '50, '51 and '52, was 
natives of the United States 7,072, foreigners and their children 10,265. The population was in 1850, native 
75,322, foreigners and their children 63,446, to bring the ratio of mortality, the annual deaths were in 1,000 
living, native 22, foreign and children 40.4; almost double. The deaths in the city of New York during the 
five years from 1848 to 1852, were natives 66,363, foreign 30,990 ; average per year, native 13,272, foreign 
6,19S. I have not the analysis of population of New York, but I think the foreign have a lower ratio of the 
living than of the deaths. The foreigners are generally — nearly universally, among the poor, who have a 
lower expectation of life, than the more comfortable classes. Almost all their circumstances operate to di- 
minish their vital power, and thus they have less power of resistance to diseases, and consequently sink more 
readily under them than others. 

" For these and other reasons, it maybe safely assumed that the immigrants are subject to a larger decrement 
of life than the natives, and in estimating their present accumulated numbers, the law of mortality may be ap- 
plied to them with a confidence that it will leave at least as many as, and probably more, than are in existence. 
* * * The only way to determine the number of foreigners and their descendants, is to first learn 
the number of immigrants from the Custom House records, certainly for one port, and by other observations 
approximately for the rest. Then ascertain their ages from the record, or from calculations divided into as 
short periods as your data will allow you. Ascertain from the tables of the law of mortality the proportion of 
those in each age who will survive to the various subsequent ages. Thus the proportion per cent, per 1,000 or 
10,000 of those who are to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, 20 to 25, etc., through all the ages discovered, or who 
will survive 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, &c, to 55 years. Applying their proportions to the numbers in each age, will show 
the number who will be alive at any future time as 1850, provided their expectation of life is as great as that of 
those upon whom the law of mortality was calculated. This will give you at least as many as were alive in 
1850, and probably more. This method is an easy one, and the principle is plain, yet it will require considerable 
arithmetical labor, which however will be justified by the reliableness of the result. Knowing the number ac- 
tually reported as having arrived through the custom houses, making such additions as will include those who 
came in otherwise, then calculating their survivorship in 1850, according to the plan herein stated, and even 
admitting the expectation of life of the foreign to be as good as that of the native, I think you will find a 
smaller number here than is reported in the returns of the marshals, and published in the Abstract, page 19, viz. 
2,210,839. 

"1 have no doubt that many of the chitdren of Irish parents, born in America, were reported to the marshals 
as natives of Ireland, and thus the number swelled from that to which you may arrive at by calculation to that 
which is stated. There are other foreigners who do not understand our language, and therefore mistake our 
inquiries and answer erroneously. Foreigners associate so exclusively together, and are socially so generally 
separated from the natives for a long time, that their feelings of alienship are inseparably connected with their 
families and their children as well as with themselves, and they do not always discriminate between locality 
of birth, parentage, blood, origin, even religion, and sometimes they merge all into one class, calling all Irish, 
&c, who are sons of Irish soil, because they have a common blood, origin, or religion. ***** 

" I am aware that there is among the immigrants a larger proportion of females of the productive age than 
among the natives. Among those who came in 1847 there were 203 per 1000 of all, and among all the whites 
of the native in 1840, the females of this age were only 143 per 1000. This would give the foreignfrs an advan- 
tage of 41.9 per cent, in this respect. In Massachusetts and in Boston, where we have the means of making 
the comparison, there is a much larger proportion both of marriages and births to the population of each kind 
among the foreigners than among the natives within three or four years. The population of Massachusetts 
was in 1850, native 830,066, foreign 164,448; that of Boston was, native 75,322, foreigners and their children 
63^,466. The marriages were in Massachusetts during the year 1849, 1850, and 1851, Americans 18,286, or 220

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



The foreign born population, which is less than one-eighth of the native white and free 
colored in the Union, is less than one-fiftieth in the South ; about one-twentieth in the South- 
west, and one-fifth in the Middle States. In the Eastern and North-western States the pro- 
portion is nearly the same as the average of the Union. 

The number of foreigners who arrived in the United States since 1190 may be stated as fol- 
lows; the arrivals from 1790 to 1820 are given on the authority of Professor Tucker; those 
subsecment to that period are obtained from the Custom House reports.*

in 10,000 of their own race ; foreigners 7,414, or 450 in 10,000. This is 104.5 per cent, excess of foreign 
over native ratio. The females in Massachusetts between twenty and forty in 1840 were 163 per 1000 
of all, and in the United States 143 per 1000. The productive ratio of the immigrants is 26.3 above 
that of the people of this State. The marriages in Boston in the three-and-a-half years from July, 1849, 
to December 31st, 1852, were, Americans 4,078, or 541 in 10,000 of their own race ; foreign 5,073, or 799 in 
10,000. This is 84.8 per cent, excess of foreign over native ratio. The births were in Massachusetts in the three 
years, 1849, '50, and '51, of American parents 47,982, or 578 in 10,000 of their own race ; foreign 24,523, or 1491 in 
10,000 of their own race. In Boston there were, American 7,278, or 986 in 10,000; foreign 13,032, or 2,053 in 
10,000 in three years. These facts certainly show a much greater tendency to marriage and a more rapid pro- 
duction among the foreign than among the native population here. On the other hand, there is much more 
mortality, especially among the children of the foreign. A great mortality of young infants is usually attended 
with more frequent births. The latter is consecutive upon the former, and too often among the poor, 
the ill-housed, and ill fed, the ignorant, and those of low health, the former is consecutive upon the latter. 
Whether this excess of marriages and births among foreigners over those among natives will be followed by a 
similar excess of those in the coming generation, who shall arrive at the marriageable age, is extremely doubtful. 
From present appearances it seems that the proportion will then be reversed." 

* The Custom House reports are known to give much less than the true number, though they are at present 
much more correct than formerly. Chickering from 1820 to 1846 supposes them to fall on the average fifty per 
cent, short of the truth for each year, and increases the total for that period from 1,354,305 to 2,031,472. Tucker, 
after making all deductions for persons going to and coming from Canada, makes the number 200,000 between 
1820 and 1830, and 631,417 between 1840 and 1850, less 100,000 Americans who emigrated to Texas. 

f.The other countries specified are France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Russia, 
Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Sardinia, Greece, China, Asia, Africa, British America, Mexico, Central America, 
South America, West Indies and the Sandwich Islands. 

There were 118,674 Germans arriving in New York in 1852, of which not more than one-third came direct 
from German ports. The number arrived in New York between 1846 and 1852, was 347,614, whilst the whole 
number of Germans emigrating from European ports for all the world during the same period, according to 
Hubner, a distinguished German statistician, was but 751,072. The number arriving at all ports of the United 
States in 1852 was 147,637, and in 1853, 142,528. The New York State Census of 1845 gives 49,558 German 
residents, 277,890 from Great Britain, 10,619 from France, and 8,222 from all other foreign countries. The census 
of Boston taken by the State authorities in 1850, gave 52,923 Irish, 2,666 Germans, and from other foreign coun- 
tries, 7,877 ; which totals include children of foreigners though native born, amounting as stated in another part 
of the report, to about 16,000. A late California authority estimates its population to consist of 215,000 Ameri-

Indians and 2,500 Negroes. The whole number of foreigners in the United States, not naturalized, returned by 
the census of 1820, was 53,687 ; by that of 1840, 107.832. In the State of New York, by the State Census of 1845, 
153,717. 

Out of 9,763 foreign males in Boston in 1845, all over 21 years of age, only 1,623 were naturalized. In 1850, 
though the proportion of foreign born to native white in that city, was about one-half, they polled only one- 
eleventh as many votes. 

The value of personal property brought by foreigners to the United States cannot be known. The emigrants 
registered in Berlin in 1851, 5,018 in number, took with them property to the aggregate amount of $323,250. 
(Hubner's u Jahrbucher.") On the average of .$30 for all classes, there will be about ,$15,000,000; but how 
much has previously been sent back by other emigrants, it is not easy to say. The English Commissioners of 
Emigration have returned the following sums remitted from America, as having come under their own know- 
ledge : in 1848, $2,226,400 ; in 1849, $2,613,600 ; in 1850, $4,719,000 ; in 1851, $4,825,480 ; making a total of 
$14,384,480 in four years. If the remittances have continued at the same rate during the last two years, 
$7,260,000 may be added to this sum, which would give a grand total of $21,644,480 for the six years.

Whether the foreign immigration can be kept np very long at its present high figure must 
be doubted. The wars in Europe which it was thought would check the tide have however 
had no effect as yet. The number arrived in New York for the quarter ending March 31st, 
1854, was 29,023, against 29,657 in the corresponding quarter of 1853.* 



* Jn regard to the number of immigrants who take the route to Canada through the United States, and those 
who come to the United States via Canada, Lord Elgin, the Governor General, was kind enough in answer 
to a request from the Census Office, to forward the following statement of the date 17th July, 1854, (56,214 
persons in Canada are reported by the last census, as of United States origin.) 

"Prior to 1852 the demand for labor was so much greater in the United States than in Canada, that no doubt 
large numbers of our emigrants were attracted thither by the high wages offered, but within the past two years 
tliis state of tilings has been reversed, and but few now proceed unless with the view of permanent settlement. 

" During the season of 1853 large numbers of laborers came to Upper Canada in consequence of the temporary 
suspension of several of the Rail Road lines in the Western States, where they all readily found employment. 

" fn the reports of this Department, submitted annually to His Excellency, I have endeavored to give an ap- 
proximate view of the distribution of the emigration received by the St. Lawrence ; this estimate is based upon 
the information collected on boarding the emigrant ships on their arrival. 



AGGREGATE POPULATION.

8. Occupations. — In 1820, 1840 and 1850 efforts were made to ascertain by the Census the 
occupations of the people of the United States. In the first instance, the white, free colored 
and slaves, male aud female, are classed together on the schedules as actualh" emploj'ed in 
commerce, agriculture, or in manufactures, and as individual producers; in the second, as em- 
ployed in mining, agriculture, commerce, manufactures and trades, navigation of the ocean, 
navigation of canals, lakes and rivers, learned professions and engineers. In the last instance, 
the particular employment of each white and free colored male over fifteen years of age, is 
indicated, and where the person follows several occupations, the principal one.

States, of both sexes and of all ages, in 1840.

" On these reports, with the information obtained from the sub-agents and the different forwarding companies, 
the estimates of the emigration to the United States is based. 

" The emigration to this Province, via the United States, is chiefly to Western Canada, and is estimated by 
Mr. Hawke at from 4 to 5,000 persons annually. Many of these parties are respectable farmers, who take the 
route of the United States, as owing to the facilities afforded by Eail Roads, &c, they are enabled to reach 
Western Canada frequently before the opening of the navigation by the route of the St. Lawrence. 

" The following extract from the Annual Reports of this Department for the years 1851, 1852 and 1853, are sub- 
mitted in further answer to the enquiry : 

" Emigrants arrived via the St. Lawrence, 1851, 41,076 ; 1852. 31,176 ; 1853, 36,699. Estimated number who 
proceeded direct to the United States, 1851, 18,500; 1852,13,300; 1853, 11,500. Estimated number arrived 
in Canada West via the United States as settlers, (this return does not include laborers who mav have come in 
for temporary employment,) 1851, 5,000 ; 1852,4,000; 1853; 5,000. 

" Over three-fourths of the foreign emisrration received by the St. Lawrence proceed direct to the western 
States. The numbers were in 1851, 876 ; 1852, 7,256 ; 1853, 7,456. To 15th July, 1854, direct, 6,805 ; for the same 
period, via Liverpool, 3,000, in all, 9, 805."

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



In 1850 the particular employments are embraced in the following list which is an aggrega- 
tion of those upon the State sheets. It is unfortunate that no more reliable exposition of the 
occupations can be given, as any one at a glance will admit. States are returned with an ag- 
gregate of particular occupations greatly short of what are known to exist, by local registers 
and directories.* In the same manner occupations known to exist are omitted. Those which 
should prevail in about equal proportions in all of the States, are in great excess in some, and 
the ratio of persons employed in different States to the whole number in those States, varies 
without regard to, and in spite of, known rules. These difficulties result, first, from the num- 
ber of persons who follow different occupations and whom the enumerators were instructed to 
designate under the leading one, a point about which there would be much difference of opinion 
and no uniformity of action, admitting the instructions to have been followed ; secondly, from 
the want of distinction between employers and employees, persons actually engaged in a 
pursuit, or as mere laborers connected with it; thirdly, from the method pursued (explained in 
the Quarto Census) in condensing the figures from the returns under such heads as "me- 
chanics not otherwise specified," "manufacturers not otherwise specified," "other occupa- 
tions," &c. Under these heads were absorbed many employments which seemed to exist in 
such small numbers in particular States as to be unworthy of notice.

* Thus, the New England Directory gives the names of 63 booksellers and stationers in Maine, though the 
Census returns but 32; of 30 in New Hampshire, while the Census gives only 24. According to the Directory 
there are 7 card manufacturers in Massachusetts, 2 in Connecticut, etc., while the Census returns none for the 
whole of New England. The Directory returns of clockmakers in Rhode Island 19, the Census 6. According 
to the Directory, there are 13 starch manufacturers in Maine, 28 in New Hampshire, 76 in Vermont; the Census 
returns none in Maine, 6 in New Hampshire and 10 in Vermont. But the illustrations are innumerable. These 
deficiencies do not, however, affect the manufacturing statistics.

AGGREGATE POPULATION 



129 



The preceding table is an attempt to reduce the employments in the previous one under 
certain classes similar to those hitherto adopted in this country and in the English and Mas- 
sachusetts returns. It must be considered very imperfect, but at the same time it is the best 
arrangement of the figures that could be devised, however arbitrary. The laborers are classed 
separately, and considered not to be agricultural, yet without doubt a large part of them are 
farm laborers, and many belong to the class of manufacturers, miners, &c. u Other occupa- 
tions''' should perhaps be added to " Trade Manufactures," &c, to which they mostly belong. 
The note will explain the rest of the method.*

In 1820 and 1830 the occupations of both sexes and all classes, including slaves, were 
returned indiscriminately. Consequently the proportions given are for those years, to each 
thousand of the aggregate population. In 1S50 they are given to each thousand of the free 
males, except for agriculture, where they are compared with the total free male and three-fifths 
of the slaves male. Had the proportion in 1850 been made to the total population, as before, 
the ratio of those employed in every thousand would not have been so much greater. 

Though the employments profess to be of both males and females in 1820 and 1840, they 
were, of course, mainly of the males. The materials of the census are, however, insufficient for 
any very reliable comparison.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES.. 



The occupation tables of passengers arriving in the United States combine citizens with 
foreigners, and cannot be separated. It is difficult, therefore, to determine whalt improve- 
ments take place in the immigrant class. If certain employments be assumed as com- 
prising mostly foreigners, there were, in 1845, of mantua-makers 96; in 1847, 183. In 1845 
there were 28 miners; in 1847, 13: in 1852, 1,179. In 1845, 1,659 servants; in 1847, 3,198; in 
1852, 942. In 1845, 18,656 laborers; in 1847, 37,571; in 1852, 82,571. In 1845, 10,154 me-

• Some reflections upon the future growth of the population of the Union, will not be im- 
proper in this place. The facts embraced in the volume show a regular diminution in the 
ratio of total as well as of natural increase from decade to decade, up to 1840, making cor- 
rections for the admission of new territory, and the shorter period than ten years included 
between the census of 1820 and 1830. From the declining per cent, of females and young 
children, Prof. Tucker argues that the natural increase of the population is inversely as its 
density in all of the States, and that the increase for the whole population, for the decades 
after 1840, would be 32 ; 31.3 ; 30.5 ; 29.6 ; 28.6; 27.5 per cent. Should emigration, however, 
remain as it was then, or be but slightly increased from year to year, the series, he supposed, 
would be 31.8; 30 9 ; 30 ; 29 ; 27.9 ; 26.8 per cent The results upon either series will be here 
shown,! but upon both they fall greatly short of the fact for 1850. The ratio from 
1840 to 1850 increased over three per cent., instead of declining as before from the previous 
decade, a result not to be accounted for by the admission of California, New Mexico, &c

The following table has been carefully prepared upon eight distinct and more or less 
probable assumptions of future increase. The reader can choose between them. In 1950 the 
population of the United States would be, in round numbers, 50,000,000, if the increase were 
no greater than that of Delaware since 1790, which has increased by far the least of all the 



* This does not include 1,016 persons, officers and prisoners on board convict hulks ; nor 1,408 persons, pas- 
sensers aboard Tier Majesty's ships; together 2,424 persons; making the total population 18,720,394. 
fThe slave population in 1920, it is supposed by Prof. Tucker, cannot exceed 31,000,000. See his argu- 
ent, page 115. 



AGGREGATE POPULATION.

States. With the increase of the Union for the last ten years, excluding all the foreigners 
■who arrived in that time, the number in 1950 would be 252,000,000. With its average in- 
crease since 1790, it would be 450.000,000, but with the increase from 1840 to 1850, nearly 
500,000,000. All of these, however, are very improbable, if not to say impossible assumptions. 
The figures in column 6 will no doubt more nearly express the truth than any other for 1900, 
and for subsequent periods a mean between columns 7 and 8 would seem preferable.

These calculations are all based upon the assumption that the territories of the Union will 
not be increased during the period from any quarter, which, considering the past, may be 
taken with some hesitation. A few remarks upon the future growth of the great cities will 
have place under the appropriate head. 

As compared with the other leading powers, the increase in the United States has been as 
follows :

The annual increase of the United States has been nearly three times as great as that of 
Prussia, notwithstanding the large population that was added to her by the partition of 
Poland; more than four times as much as Prussia; six times as much as Great Britain ; nine 
times as much as Austria; ten times as much as France, Upon the basis of past increase the 
future of Great Britain and France may be thus estimated:

PART III. 



MORAL AND SOCIAL CONDITION. 



The subject so far as the materials of the Census admit, may be thus considered : 

I. RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. 

II. EDUCATION". 

III. THE PRESS. 

IV. LIBRARIES. 
V. CHARITIES. 

VI. WAGES OF LABOR. 

VII. CRIME. 

I. Religious Worship. — In the United States there is no established system, but freedom of 
religious faith and worship is guaranteed by the Constitution. 

The statistics of the Census are as complete as they can be obtained from the schedules. It 
will be observed that they do not undertake, as they are often quoted, to give the number of 
members of each religious denomination, or even the number of actual attendants upon churches, 
but simply the capacity of the churches to accommodate. In an early publication of the office, 
places returned as churches, but without the extent of accommodation, or the value of church 
property, were not included in the tables, upon the ground that they were not probably ex- 
clusively set apart for religious worship. If the object were simply to ascertain the number 
of church buildings, their value, etc.; this would have answered, but as it is evident that con- 
clusions will be drawn from the results favorable or adverse to the religious character of the 
several communities, it must be exceptionable. In the rural districts, thousands of buildings 
are used both for school houses, and for places of religious worship: rude sheds or log houses 
in which denominations meet with regularity, and in which prayer is as fervently offered as 
in the Cathedrals of the cities. There would be no propriety in excluding these. . Where sev- 
eral sects worship in the same building, as the best that could be done, its accommodation 
and value are divided between them if named otherwise they are placed under the head of Free. 

Under the head of " Minor Sects," such denominations in the States are included as were so 
few in number as to be deemed unworthy of special notice. Had they all been mentioned, 
the aggregate of the several denominations would have been somewhat increased. The minor 
sects will therefore be divided between the denominations mentioned by name, and the follow- 
ing, and perhaps a few others not specifically referred to in the tables. 

Albright, Associate Reformed, Covenanters, Campbellites, Church of Brotherly Love, 
Church of God, Disciples, Dissenters, Emanuels, Evangelicals, New Jerusalem, Public Re- 
formers, Second Advent, United Brethren, New Lights, Whitfield, Winebranarian, Indepen- 
dent Welch. Grace, Central, Seceders, &c. 

There are 38,183 buildings returned as used for purposes of religious worship in the United 
States in 1850, belonging to denominations having accommodations for 14,270,139 persons, and 
of a total value including other church possessions, of $87,446,371. The occupation sheets 
ghow 26,842 regular clergymen, to which if those performing occasional clerical duties be 
added, the number will be swelled to about 30,000.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



Thus the Methodist and Baptist together have more than one-half of all the churches, and 
the Episcopal and Roman Catholic are about equal in number. 

The Methodist and Presbyterian have a larger amount of church property than any other 
denomination, the two being very nearly equal in amount. The Baptist and Episcopal are 
next, and are also about equal. The Catholics, though they have but one-eleventh as many 
churches as the Methodists, have much more than half the church property.

In capacity to accommodate worshippers at one time, the Methodists are placed highest 
upon the list; next in order are the Baptists, then the Presbyterians. The Catholics occupy 
the fourth place, though in point of fact, they hare no doubt more actual worshippers than 
they can accommodate at one sitting in their churches.* 

After filling out by averages, the blanks which were left by the marshals in the value and 
accommodation of many churches, the following figures result, which may bo considered as 
expressing more nearly the facts. Three columns are added, showing the population and 
church accommodation and churches to the square mile. The average being about four 
churches to every 300 square miles, or one church to about seventy-fire. In Massachusetts 

* In Great Britain the churches are adequate to the accommodation of 57 per cent, of the population.

The average value of churches in the United States, would therefore seem to be $2,35*7 ; 
their average capacity of accommodation 3*16 persons. There are about five churches to 



Preshyterians, 1850, Synods 23 ; Presbyteries 127, 2,160 clergy, 2,595 churches, communicants 207,254 ; religious 
contributions for religious purposes, $390,630. These are the Old School. The census includes all Presby- 
terians, and irregular as well as regular churches, which may account for the difference. 

A statement taken from the Baptist Almanac of 1850, with corrections for Cumberland Preshyterians, gives 
the following for all denominations.

every 3.000 of the total population, and every 2.600 of the white and free colored. The average 
value of churches to each person, excluding slaves, is $4.50. Six hundred and nineteen per- 
sons in every 1,000 of the whole population of the United States, and 72 in every 100 of the 
whites and free colored, can be accommodated at one sitting in the churches. The Methodists 
have 1 church for every 1,739 of the total population, the Baptists 1 in 2.478, the Presbyterians 
1 in 4,769, Episcopal 1 in 15,874, Catholic 1 in 18.901, other sects 1 in 2,923. For the several 
States the particulars of the table are curious and instructive.

According to the returns of the marshals without correction in the office, the church statis- 
tics for the great sections of the Union, show that the New England and Middle States and the 
Territories and California, have nearly the same average value to their churches, which is nearly 
four times that of other sections. The average accommodation of churches differs much less. 
The South accommodates as much of its population as the Middle States, and only a little less 
than New England.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



The annexed tables show the ratio of the whole church accommodation possessed by each 
of the leading denominations in the several sections. In New England the Congregational pre- 
ponderates ; in all others except the territories, the Methodist ; in the Territories and California, 
the Catholic. The Baptists are second in rank every where except in the Middle States and 
California. The churches of Charleston accommodate a larger portion of the whole popula- 
tion than do those of Boston, and their average property and value to each person is about 
equal. If the slaves be excluded, the average value to each person is twice as large in 
Charleston as in Boston, &c.

2. Education. — The objections that were taken to the statistics of Insanity in the Census ©f 
1840, were also taken to those of Education, and were replied to in the report of the office, 
noticed under the chapter of Free Colored Population. Under Universities or Colleges in that 
census were included all institutions that were not academies, primary or common schools, 
and thus it was thought that their number was made too large. The distinction of " scholars 
at public charge," and not at public charge, was also objected to, since in some of the States 
common schools are supported by a public tax or by funds provided by the public for the 
education of all the children, and therefore none of them it was said could be considered as 
educated otherwise than at public charge. The distinction was no doubt one of difficult ap- 
plication, and by no means as satisfactory as that which was adopted in 1850, though at 
neither census was it true that all of the children at common schools in any of the States are 
educated at the public expense. Where a portion of the expense is voluntarily raised or con- 
tributed by parents, their children can hardly oe considered as at public charge. 



EDUCATION. 



141 



Instead of the distribution of institutions into " universities and colleges.'' {: academies and 
grammar schools," and " primary schools," adopted in 1840, in 1S50 they were classed as 
1st. " Colleges." or institutions empowered to grant degrees, as well for male or female, includ- 
ing law, medical and theological institutions. 2d. " Academies and other schools. - ' or all 
such as are not embraced under 3d, '"'Public schools," receiving their support in whole or in 
part from taxation or public funds. In framing the tables, however, it was found that female 
colleges, law institutions, etc., had been sometimes classed improperly with academies. In 
many of the States, particularly at the South, there is no general public school system, some 
counties, etc, supporting schools by taxes levied within their own limits, and in other cases 
the State contributing a proportion towards the support of private schools. Such schools are 
considered always as public in the census. Many academies also receive a limited support 
from public funds. 

The marshals were instructed to specify whether the institution be a college, academy, fe- 
male seminary, public school, military, theological, or other school, and state the number of 
teachers, and the average number of scholars in regular attendance. They were also in- 
structed to give the annual revenue from any permanently invested fund or endowment — the 
amount received by each institution from taxes assessed for educational purposes, and if this 
cannot be ascertained, then the gross amount of taxes assessed in the district for school pur- 
poses — the amount received from State or district appropriations or public funds, exclusively of 
the taxes above mentioned — the amount otherwise received, including every other kind of 
revenue. There is no doubt that they did not always distinguish very carefully between 
the different sources of revenue and that the statistics upon the whole are imperfect, though 
the best that can be obtained.

The blanks which were left by the marshals in many of the returns of education are not 
Bupplied in table CXLY. Filling them up, however, with figures which are the average 



144 



STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



of the institutions returned in the same localities, the preceding table will result. The defi- 
ciencies were ia the number of scholars, or amount of income, or both. The results for Cali- 
fornia must be considered questionable, growing out of a wrong classification of scholars, 
though the average to scholars in all schools may be nearer correct. It will be seen that the 
cost of academy and private school education to each pupil is a third larger at the south than 
at the north, and the average for the Union is $22.16. To each public school scholar the 
expense at the south is twice as great as at the north, and the average for the Union is 
$2.94. Whilst the south pays to its institutions of learning $2.90 for each person between the 
acres of five and twenty, the north pays but $2-30, and the average paid in the whole Union 
is $2.50. 

The following table will show the number of persons returned by families at school in 1850. 
The number falls short of that returned by the institutions themselves, as will be seen on com- 
parison. The families returned those at school at any time during the year excluding Sunday 
schools. The institutions returned the average at school during the year, which should be a 
smaller number, whereas, in fact, it is larger. Either, institutions have put their averages too 
high or families have been negligent in their returns. The latter is most probable, though the 
error may have occurred in both.

The American Almanac for 1854 reports the names of 119 colleges and professional schools 
in the United States, 44 theological schools, 16 law schools, and 36 medical colleges; in all 215 
such institutions. It will be seen that the number does not fall far short of the census, 
although the report of students is much less. The census gives the average of the whole year 
and should on that account exceed this statement, which has also many blanks unfilled.

STATISTICS OF THE UNITED STATES. 



"It has," says Chancellor Kent, '-been uniformly a part of the land system of the United 
States to provide for public schools. The Articles of Confederation, 1*787, the acts admitting 
into the Union Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Louisiana, Florida, Arkansas, &c, all pro- 
vided for the appropriation of lands in each township for the use of public schools. The 
elevated policy of the federal government as one of our statesmen has observed, was a 
noble and beautiful idea of providing wise institutions for the unborn millions of the west, 
of anticipating their good by a sort of parental providence, and of associating together the 
social and the territorial development of the people, by incorporating these provisions with the 
land titles derived from the public domain."

S ome pains have been taken in the census office to collect the reports of the several States 
from year to year, from which the following in regard to common school education is con- 
densed. The reader will compare the items with those of the census. The discrepancies 
may in part be explained by the faulty system of classification adopted, and by the dis- 
tinction of average and regular scholars. The statistics which follow relate to the public 
schools of the several States and cities.J (See Note.)

differ from those already given. This difference is perhaps to be attributed to the statistics being for differ- 
ent years.

Germany. — School laws adopted in Wirtemberg 1559, and modified in 1565. in Saxonv in 1560. and improved 
in 1580, in Hesse in 1565, and in Brandenberg still earlier, substantially established the school system, which 
prevails at this day throughout Germany. Thus is recognized on the part of government the limy to co- 
operate with parents in the education of their children, and to provide against their neglect of doing so. This 
was secured in every state of Germany before the beginning of the present century. 

Prussia. — The cardinal provisions of the school system are. that all children between the ages of 7 and 14 
shall regularly attend school, and that their teachers shall be educated. As a proof of the workings of the sys 
tern, in 1846 but of 122.897 men in the standing army, only 2 soldiers were found who could not both read asd 
write. In 1846 there were 24,030 schools — average attendance of scholars, bovs 1.235.448. girls 1.197.885 in ele- 
mentary schools ; in higher schools 43,516 boys and 48,302 girls; in town' schools 15.624 scholars :'in normal

117 gymnasia for classical education, with 29,474 scholars and 1,664 professors: 7 universities, with 4.000 stu- 
dents and 471 professors ; 382 infant schools, and 25,000 scholars, besides other special schools. In 1845 there 
were in the whole of Prussia only 2 young men in one hundred between the ages of 20 and 22. who could not 
read, write and cipher ; 34,000 teachers had all been thoroughly educated in the studies they were to teach : 1843,

EDUCATION. 149 

corrections, the results are sufficiently remarkable. Maine has a larger proportion at school 
than any other State or country; Denmark exceeds the United States, and the United States 
exceeds all other countries, even if the slaves are not excluded from the calculation. Portugal is 
lowest in the list and is followed by Russia. The results cannot be considered as more than 
a fair approximation though founded upon official data. They do not take into account the 
greater or less time which each scholar is at school, or the greater or less amount of profi- 
ciency attained. 

In \he Southern States the number of children educated at home by private tutors in con- 
sequence of the population being scattered, is immensely greater in proportion to the whole 
than in other parts of the Union. Such children are therefore not reported in the table of 
institutions, and would perhaps be omitted in that of scholars by families, since the marshals 
were only required to ask what member of the family has been at school within the last 
year: " he is to insert a mark opposite the names of all those whether male or female who have 
been at educational institutions within tha^ period." Again in the same States a large 
number of students are always abroad for education, and are returned with the schools, 
colleges, &c, of other States. An examination of Massachusetts shows, out of 2,357 ''stu- 
dents - ' mentioned, Til or one-third nearly, born out of the State, and 152, or one-fifteenth 
born in the South. On the other hand a southern town taken at random, furnished one out of 
three editors, four out of twelve teachers, two out of seven clergymen born in the non-slave- 
hokling States. 

The average annual time of attendance at school of each child is much larger in the South- 
ern than in the Northern States, in consequence of white labor being less required in indus- 
trial pursuits. Thus three children at school for nine months may, for some purposes be com- 
pared with nine children at school for three months, &c. It would require perhaps ten times 
the number of school houses and teachers in Virginia, to educate the same number of persons 
ac in Massachusetts. "The social intercourse of the South compensates to some extent for 
its want of schools. The people are taught to think and to converse, and the reunions which 
are so frequent are the occasions of interchanging opinions and of diffusing intelligence.* 

The statistics for this note are made up from official sources, and in some cases where these have not been 
accessible, from other data. In addition there are in Europe 345 schools of agriculture, with lectures in 16 
universities on the same subject. 

In the whole of England and Wales, among 367.S94 couples married in "3 years, 123,458 men and 181,378 wo- 
men could neither read nor write. In 1S42, 33.031 men and 56,965 women, out of a total of 118.625 couples. 
affixed their marks instead of signatures ; in lS14, 42,912 men and 65.073 women out of a total of 132.249 
couples. In 1846 in London, 11.6 per cent, of the men, and 22.6 of the women affixed their mark. Through- 
out all England and Wales, 32.6 per cent, of the men and 48.1 of the women marrying, .affixed their mark. In 
the French army in 1851, of 311,218 conscripts, 34 in a hundred could neither read nor write, 3£ could read 
only, 59i in a hundred could read and write, 3 in 100 unknown. It has already been stated that in the Prus- 
sian army of 122,897 only 2 persons could not read and write. 

* Professor Tucker remarks as follows upon the statistics of education for 1840, at the North and the South : 

" These diversities are attributable to several causes, but principally to the difference in density of numbers, 
and in the proportion of town population. In a thinly peopled country, it is very difficult for a poor man to 
obtain schooling for his children, either by his own means, or by any means that the State is likely to provide, 
but where the population is dense, and especially in towns, it is quite practicable to give to every child the 
rudiments of education, without onerously taxing the community. This is almost literally true in all the 
New England States and New York, and is said to be the case in the Kingdom of Prussia. It is true that. i:i 
the North-western States, and particularly those which are exempt from slaves, the number of their elemen- 
tary schools is much greater than that of the Southern or South-western States, although their population is 
not much more dense ; but, besides that, the settlers of those States, who were mostly from New England 
or New York, brought with them a deep sense of the value and impot ance of the schools for the people, they 
were better able to provide such schools, in consequence of their making their settlement, as had been done 
in their parent States, in townships and villages. We thus see that Michigan, which has but a thin population 
cvpii in the settled parts of the State, has schools for nearly one-seventh of its population. The wise policy 
pursued, first in New England, and since by the States settled principally by their emigrants, of laying off 
tbeir territory into townships, and of selling all the lands of a portion before those of other townships are 
brought into market, has afforded their first settlers the benefits of social intercourse and of co-operation. In 
this way they were at once provided with places of worship, and with schools adapted to their circumstance*." 

Mr. Porter, in his Progress of Great Eritain, remarks upon the deficiency of actual information which often 
exists among those who are capable of reading and writing : 

" The reports of the statistical societies of Manchester ai;d London have shown how unworthy of the name 
of education, is the result of what is attempted in the majority of schools frequented by children of the work- 
ing classes, and which are frequently kept by persons whose only qualification for this employment seems 
to be their unfitness for every other. 

" A lamentable proof of the correctness of this remark is offered in the following extract from the report for 
1839. of the chaplain of the Juvenile Prison at Parkhurst: — One point has forcibly struck my attention, and 
that is, the comparatively large amount of acquirement in the mechanical elements of instruction (the art of 
reading and repetition from memory,) contrasted with the lamentably small degree of actual knowledge pos- 
sessed, either of moral duty or religious principle. 

'•This appears mainly to have arisen from the meaning of the words read, or sounds repeated, having rarely 
been made the subjects of inquiry or reflection. The following digest will in some degree illustrate ibis posi- 
tion. Your Lordship will perceive that although fifty-eight prisoners can in some degree read, eighty-three 
repeat some or all of the church catechism, and forty-three possess some knowledge of Holy Scripture, only 
twenty-nine (exactly half the number of readers) can give even a little account of the meaning of words read", 
or sounds in use ; and of these it appears very often to be the strength of the intellect exercised at the mo- 
ment, and not the result of prior reflection, that leads them to the meaning of a word. 

" Another feature of the moral condition of the Parkhurst prisoners cannot but arrest the attention strongly, 
and that is. the very large proportion thvt hare received instruction for a considerable period of time in tlse 
variou- schools with which our country abounds. A digest of this portion of the general table will show, that 
out of 102 lads, 94 have attended schools ; 69 of whom have been day scholars for terms longer than a year, 
eight only having never b^en nt school. 

''Read tolerable 20-; read indifferently 38; read scarcely at all 14 ; read not at all 30— total 102. Of those 
there attended school from 8 to 12 years, 2 ; from 5 to 8, 5*; from 3 to 5, 21 ; from 1 to 3, 44 ; under 1 year, 22; 
never at school, 8 — total 102. »'

* The foreign born children between five and fifteen years of age in four counties of Iowa, four of Michigan, 
three of Tennessee, three of Rhode Island, five of Louisiana, and one ward of New York, were exactly ascer- 
tained from the returns, and constituted 13.5 per cent, of the whole foreign born there. The proportion of those 
who arrived in the country between five and fifteen years of age in 1845, '47, and '52, was about 15 per cent. A 
mean between the two was taken, or 14 per cent. The foreign born over twenty years of ago were obtained 
from the returns of immigration for the same years, which showed an average of about 60 per cent.

EDUCATION. 



153 



By the preceding table it seems that the proportion of pupils to the whole population 
has increased largely in the several sections, but most considerably in the South and South- 
west The figures for 1850 are those which were returned by families. The proportion for the 
Union has increased from 13.89 to 20.14 per cent. On the other hand, in consequence of the 
large influx of foreigners, those over twenty years of age of the whole white population 
who cannot read and write has increased in every section, and in the United States from 3.77 
per cent, to 5.03. By another table which follows, the proportion of the illiterate native and 
foreign white and free colored, will be seen. The proportion of foreign illiterate in the Union 
is twice that of the native, whilst the proportion of foreign illiterate to the whole number of 
foreign over 20 is only a little less than twice as great as for the native.

In New England, so admirable is the school system and so deserving of all imitation, that 
only one person over twenty years of age is incapable of reading and writing, in every four 
hundred of the number of native whites. In the south and southwest the number is one in 
about twelve ; and in the territories one in about six ; in the slaveholding states one in twelve ; 
in the non-slaveholding one in forty ; in the whole Union one in about twenty-two. In this 
calculation the unknown nativities are given to the natives, and the free colored illiterate are 
supposed to be native, as they have not been separated. If all the foreign illiterate be 
assumed to be white, it would seem they are in excess in the southern States over the northern, 
in proportion to the whole number, and that for the Union they are nearly twice as numerous 
as the native, being about one illiterate to every twelve foreign born persons. Comparing, 
however, with the total foreign over twenty, assuming sixty per cent, to be of that age, as is 
explained in another place, it appears that one in every seven in the United States cannot read 
and write, whilst for the native one in twelve. The proportion of colored natives who cannot 
read and write is about 21.03; the same at the south and in the north west ; sixteen per cent, 
in the non-slaveholding States and twenty-four per cent, in the slaveholding States, assuming 
all the illiterate colored to be native. The assumptions do not affect the result in any appre- 
ciable manner, though necessary to the calculation.

3. The Press. — Another important branch of social statistics is supplied by the periodical press. 
In every country the Press must be regarded a great educational agency. Professor Tucker well 
remarks : " In attending to the vast it does not overlook the minute. We meet with the specula- 
tions of wisdom and science, the effusions of sentiment, the sallies of wit. The most secluded her- 
mit, if he only takes a newspaper, sees as in a telescope, and often as in a mirror, every thing that 
is transacted in the most distant regions; nor can any thing memorable happen, that it is not 
forthwith communicated with the speed of steam to the whole civilized world." Freedom of 
speech and of the press are the inalienable birth right of every American citizen, and consti- 
tute the aegis of his liberties. 

The origin of newspapers may be traced to Italy in the sixteenth century. The first in 
England appeared under Queen Elizabeth, at the time of the Spanish Armada. The ear- 
liest newspaper was entitled the English Mercurie, imprinted at London, by her Highness' printer. 
1588. Periodical papers were first used during the civil wars of the commonwealth.* The 
earliest newspaper in North America was the Boston News-Letter, issued April 24, 1*704. 
In 1720, there were but seven newspapers in the American Colonies. In 1775 thirty-five, to 
wit : 7 in Massachusetts, 1 each in New Hampshire, and Georgia, 2 each in Khode Island, Ma- 
ryland, Virginia and North Carolina, 3 in South Carolina, 4 each in Connecticut and New 
York, and 9 in Pennsylvania. 

The newspaper and periodical statistics of 1850 fall short of, rather than exceed, the reality. 
An effort was made to obtain at least one copy of every journal published in the United 
States in that year, and the assistant marshals were entrusted with the matter. It has been 
attended to but partially, and the papers obtained fall very far short of the actual number re- 
turned by name. This is to be regretted, as such a file, complete in every respect, properly 
bound and placed away in the Library of Congress, would be a great national curiosity, and 
have great interest with the future antiquarian. As far as the papers are received, proper 
care will be taken in their preservation. In the whole list, between forty and fifty are pub- 
lished in German ; about a dozen in French ; several in Spanish, Italian, etc. 



* In 1827, there appeared in Great Britain, 483 different newspapers and other periodicals to 23,400,000 inhab- 
itants. In 1842: papers in London 125, circulation 32,166,474; England, exclusive of London, 221 papers. 
17.508,381 circulation; Wales 12 papers, 415,930 circulation; Scotland 76 papers, 5,388,079; Ireland 87, 
5,986,639. Total papers 521, circulation 61,495,503. In Sweden and Norway, 82 journals to 3,866,000 inhabi- 
tants ; in the States of the Church, 6 newspapers to 2,598,000 inhabitants, (Stockholm, with 78,000 inhabitants. 
has 30 journals ; Rome, with 154,000 only 3;) Denmark, to 1,950,000 inhabitants, has 80 journals, of which 71 
are in the Danish language ; 23 are devoted to politics ; 25 to the sciences. Prussia has 12,416,000 inhabitants, 
and 288 journals and periodicals. (Berlin has 221,000 inhabitants, and 53 periodical works ; Copenhagen has 
109,000 inhabitants, and 57 journals.; The Netherlands have 3,000,000 inhabitants, and 150 journals. In the 
German Confederation, (excluding Austria and Prussia,) there are 13,300,000 inhabitants, and 305 journals; in 
Saxonv, to 1,400,000 inhabitants, 54 newspapers ; in Hanover, to 1,550,000 inhabitants, 16 newspapers; in Ba-

159 



Averaging the subscription of each newspaper and periodical published in the United States, 
the daily at two cents, tri-weekly, kc, at three, weekly at five, semi-monthly at seven, monthly at 
twelve, and quarterly at fifty cents, there would be a total of $15,000,000 expended upon 
that department of the press, if actually collected. The whole issue for one year, estimateed 
upon the basis of an ordinary country paper, would cover a surface of one hundred square 
miles, or constitute a belt of thirty feet wide around the earth, and weigh neaiiv 
70,000,000 pounds. The very heavy circulation of the Northern cities is accounted for from 
the fact that these cities supply every section of the country, and more especially the Southern 
and South-western States, which show such a small proportion of native papers. UnleM the 
proper deductions are made, the newspaper statistics will not be a fair criterion in judg- 
ing of the several sections, but no data exists in the office for such corrections. 

4. Public Libraries. — Great attention is bestowed in every part of the United States in 
the establishment of libraries for the use of institutions and the public. The number of such 
libraries and their statistics, as returned by the census of 1850, are given in the table. Private 
libraries containing over 1000 volumes were also returned, but not generally, and they will 
not therefore be published.

5. Charities. — Pauperism being one of the evils of old and densely settled communities, 
could not prevail in the United States to any considerable extent, even were the system of 
government and laws prevailing not an additional guarantee against its existence. An ex- 
amination of the returns of public hospitals,, poor houses. <fcc., "will show that the foreign im- 
migrants furnish a large part of their material. It is also found as in other countries, that in 
communities purely agricultural pauperism is much less recognized than in those that are 
commercial and manufacturing*. 

The census returns the number of paupers supported in each county in the United States, 
in whole or in part at public expense "within the year preceding, and the actual number on 
the 1st June. 1850, native and foreign, with other particulars. As no account is taken in it 
of those supported or relieved by individual charities, the -statistics, it has been thought, 
would not represent the whole of the facts, and if absolutely relied upon a3 a test of condi- 
tion would be unjust towards those sections in which nearly the whole of the relief is public. 
Perceiving the weight of the objection the superintendent issued a circular in March. 1854, 
to the proper officers of several States in different sections, in order, if possible, to make some 
estimates of the private charities, benevolent associations; etc., but although many interesting 
returns were received, they were not as numerous as were desired. The following, however, 
from Massachusetts and Rhode Island, Xew Jersey, Georgia and South Carolina will show 
that private relief by societies and associations, is administered to a large extent in States 
where the poor laws are most perfect, and reasoning for the whole from a part taken from sec- 
tions indiscriminately, it may not be unfair to assume that the proportion relieved by other 
than public means does not differ much in the several States.f

* Mr. Porter in his " Progress of the Nation," page 98, however states that the burthen of the poor rate in 
proportion to population nTEngland, was found to press generally greatest in the most agricultural counties. 

\ The northern population and returns are of the towns which are named, and the southern of the counties, 
including slaves, except in the case of Macon, which is for the town only, and the aggregates of each are nearly 
equal : yet the north expends one-third more and relieves more than four times the number of persons. Com- 
pared with the white population, she would still relieve a* much or more. 

f The annual sum expended in relief by the several societies in Charleston, is estimated in its census at- 
about .$25,000, which is exclusive of clothing, food, medicine, &c, and private relief. Of 410 persons admit- 
ted to the poor house of Charleston in 1848, only 63 were born in the eity, and 258 were foreigners. In the five-

The following table will show the number of public paupers and the amount expended in 
their support during the year preceding June 1, 1850, as returned in the schedules of social 
statistics. These schedules did not separate the color of either criminals or paupers as indi- 
cated in the act of Congress. For such distinction the schedules of population must be con- 
sulted. The number of paupers on the 1st of June the marshals were required to obtain from 
the population returns and the other facts from parish or county records. 

years ending 1848, the cost of pauperism in Charleston averaged less than $7,000 per annum, of which the 
city, deducting the value of labor, did not pay much more than $1,000. In a pamphlet upon the charities of 
Boston, published in the North American Review, the donations by individuals for charitable institutions and 
charitable purposes in that city in 30 years, are given, and average about $40,000 per annum. A more complete 
statement in the Boston census gives the total contributions up to 1845, to institutions for charitable purposes, 
$2,272,990. An average of 2,076 paupers, by the same volume, received out door support in the years 1841 to 
1845, 1,402, in door, 3,478 total. In the year 1837-'40 of 8,671 paupers of Massachusetts, 2,567 only were< Ameri- 
can. In 1845 the cost of pauperism in Boston was paid by the city, $23,944, and by the State $26,894. The 
local report of New York shows number admitted to Blackwell Island alms house, last six months of 1849, 
1,672, of whom 411 were natives, and 1,006 Irish. At Belleview 3,114 admitted, 618 being native and 2,052 
Irish. Colored in the Colored Home of New York, 1849, 713. New York city, January to July 1849, 1st Dis- 
trict sent to State Prison 28 white and 4 colored ; to Blackwell Island 783 white, 94 colored ; remaining in 
prison, 253 white and 27 colored; 2d District, whole year 1849, committed 1,908 whites, 21 colored. As the 
amount of mortality has much to do with the physical well being of a people, and will be dependent in some 
measure upon pauperism, some remarks may be appended here which were too late for the sections of mor- 
tality. According to Dr. Emerson, the proportion of black deaths to the total black population, in Philadel- 
phia, for the ten years from 1821 to 1830, was about one in every 21 ; in the ten years ending in 1840, 1 in 
every 31 f the ratio for the whites in the latter period being 1 in every 43. In the report of the Prison Discip- 
line Association at Philadelphia in 1845, it is said, out of 1,000 of each color residing in the city, 196 blacks die 
for every 100 whites, and in the Penitentiary 316 blacks for every 100 whites. In the Wethersfield (Conn.) 
Penitentiary, the average rate of deaths from 1841 to 1844 was, white 2.82; colored 10.96. In the Eastern 
Penitentiary of Pennsylvania, during the three years ending with 1843, the average rate of deaths was 1.85 
white deaths and 6.63 black. In the Philadelphia Prison during a period of ten years the proportion of deaths 
among the whites was one in 46, among the blacks, one in 12. The admissions into the Eastern Penitentiary 
of Pennsylvania from October 29th, 1845 until December 1845, were 2,054 whites, 692 blacks. The city in- 
spector of Ne-w York, in his report for 1853, says that the deaths among the colored population averaged 604 
each year from 1847 to 1853, and that " while the general population is rapidly swelling, and the deaths bearing 
their proportional increase, the colored mortal record exhibits its significant declination. 

Public expenditure in England and Wales for the poor— 1840, £4,576,965, population 15,710,270; 1843, 
£5,208,027, population 16,314,671 ; 1848, £6,180,764, population 17,521,956. The average from 1825 to 1835;was 
much larger to a smaller population. 

Number relieved in England and Wales— 1840, in door 169,233, out door 1 ,030,297, total 1,199,529; 1843, 
in door 238,560, out door 1,300,930 : total 1,539,490 ; 1848, in door 265,140, out door 1,361,061 : total 1,626,201. 

Before completing the tables of charities, the following statistics of the Order of Odd Fellows which has 
been doing so much in this field, may be properly inserted. They are aggregated for ten years, from 1843 to

The above table was compiled in the office from the population schedules, and gives the 
number in poor houses. Time did not admit of an examination of other States. The table 
differs from the previous one which includes paupers in or out of poor houses, but receiving 
public support on the same day. 

6. Wages. — The marshals were instructed to report the rates of wages prevailing in the 
several sections, from which the following was aggregated.

The Commissioner of Patents in 1848 sent out a circular to all of the States, in order to 
ascertain the rates ; of wages paid by the agricultural interest. Answers were received from most 
of the States, which showed a remarkable uniformity. The average wages to field laborers 
with board, ranged from 10 to 15 dollars for the whites, and from 5 to 12 for the slaves, the 
average for female domestics with board, ranged from 4 to 6 dollars for the whites and 3 to 
5 for slaves. The average wages of mechanics from ^5 cents to $1.50 per day, reaching in Texas 
as high as $3. Upon the whole the rates seemed to be lowest in the Northwest, and highest in 
the Southwest for white labor — the South and the North differing very little.f The money 

Since the preparation of table CLXXII, Glynn county, Georgia, reports no persons relieved by private so- 
cieties, but that all of its schools are free schools supported from a county fund. Q.uincy, Mass., 112 persons re- 
lieved, cost $159.55; Newburyport 280 relieved, cost $2,496; Salem 195 relieved wholly, 1,302 in part, cost 
$11,675.29; Florida, Alachua county, 69 in part, 28 wholly, cost$'/31.00. 

f The weekly net earnings of factory hands at Manchester, England, in full employment, in 1849: — Card 
Room, males 12s.: females 8s, 6d.; spinners 12s.; Power Loom Weavers 9s. 5<L; helpers 4s. 8d.; Mechanics 19s. 
3d. The wages of other workmen were as follows: Colliers at iron works in Staffordshire, average weekly, 
16s. 3(Z.; miners 13s. lid.; masons, smiths and carpenters, 10s. 6d. 

From the replies addressed by British Consuls to the home government in 1833, it appears that wages ranged 
upon the continent for agricultural laborers, viz: Ploughmen in France 100 to 160 shillings per annum with 
board, laborers in France, 5 to 15i. per day, in the latter case without board or dwelling furnished ; in Ger- 
many 4$d. to Id., with lodging, but without board ; in the Netherlands 3d. to Ad. with board and lodging, 5d. to 
16d. without either; in Italy at Genoa, 60 shillings to 100 shillings per annum; in Tuscany 40 shilling per 
nnmjrri, in both cases with board and lodging. These are for farm servants. Farm laborers are returned at 
6<f. per day, without board or lodging. The replies to the Poor Law Commissioners gave for 6 or 800 parishes 
in England an average earning to a family consisting of man, wife and four children, ages 14, 11, 8 and 5, the 
eldest a boy, £41 17s. 8d. In 71 parishes this amount was stated to be insufficient for support without relief, 
and in 337 barely sufficient or sufficient without meat.

which 273 colored, in Boston alone, 4,779 whites and 186 colored; in the House of Correction, Boston, 50 
colored and 1,006 whites; of the whites 738 foreign ; in the State, whole whites 3,028, whole colored 159, of 
which, foreigners 1,942. Out of a total of 9,353 criminal offences, for which persons were imprisoned, 3,941 
were for intemperance, and 1,363 for debt. In 1852 the whole number of paupers supported or relieved in the 
State was 27,737, of whom 11,321 were foreigners: 12,337 were relieved in aims houses — the average in such 
houses being 5,010; total expense of paupers $476,674. In Boston alone, 9,464 paupers, of whom 5,913 were 
foreign. Average in alms houses 1,295; 3,098 children under 14 supported at public expense. The average of 
5 years, 1841 to 1845, shows 2,653 commitments to jail, 2,855 cases in police courts, 708 in city court, 426 con- 
victions, 33 sent to State prison, and 637 to house of correction — 40 per cent, in the house of correction were 
females, 8.63 per cent, were colored, 25 per cent, were citizens of Massachusetts, and 51.98 per cent, foreigners.

Mr. Porter, in review of the above result finds nothing whatever,he says,to support the assertion so often 
hazarded, that vice and crime are fostered by bringing men together in large masses, while innocence is pre- 
served by rural pursuits. For each million of inhabitants there were charged with offences in 20 more agricul- 
tural counties in 1841, 1,723, and in 20 less agricultural, 1,842. He adds — if we class together those who 
can neither read nor write, and those who have acquired only an imperfect acquaintance with those elemen- 
tary branches of knowledge, in 13 years, out of a total of 335,429 persons committed, and whose degree of in- 
struction was ascertained, the great proportion of 304,772, or more than 90 in 100, were uninstructed, while 
only 1,333 persons had enjoyed the benefit of instruction beyond the elementary degree, and only 29,324 had 
mastered without advancing beyond the art of reading and writing. 

In England and Wales in 1841, the commitments were 1 in every 573 persons, and in Scotland 1 in 738.

PART IV. 



INDUSTRY 



1. Agriculture. — The following table will show the relative number of farms, and quantity 
of acres in each in the several Suites and Territories, as well as the value of farms and im- 
plements. The unimproved land embraces such as is in occupancy and necessarv to the 
enjoyment of the improved, though not itself reclaimed. Meadow lands in all of the 
States are therefore regarded improved. The returns do not, however, distinguish always 
very clearly the improved from the unimproved.

The average number of acres embraced in each farm in the United States is 203, valued at 
$2,258, and upon each farm there is an average of $105 in implements and machinery. In 
Louisiana, so complicated is the sugar process, the average machinery is $863 to the farm. 

By another table prepared by sections, it would seem that only about one-thirteenth of 
the whole area of the organized States and Territories is improved, and about one-eighth 
more is occupied and not improved. In New England about 26 acres in the 100 are improved, 
in the South 16 acres, in the Northwest 12, and in the Southwest 5. In the South the num- 
ber of acres to the farm is largest, but the value per acre is most in the Middle States. The 
average value per acre for the Union, improved and unimproved, is $11.14. The whole num- 
ber of acres occupied is 293,560,614, or nearly one-sixth part of the national domain.

The annexed table embraces the returns of agricultural products and live stock by the Cen- 
sus of 1840 and 1850. The quantity of wheat in 1850 is believed to be understated, and the 
crop was also short. Rough rice is returned for 1850, and clean rice for 1840. Corrections 
have been made in the cotton and sugar returns since the publication of the Quarto Census, 
pounds having been intended by the enumerators in many cases, where they returned bales or 
hogsheads. It is impossible to reconcile the hemp and flax returns of 1840 and 1850. No doubt 
in both cases tons and pounds have often been confounded. In a few of the States, such as In- 
diana and Illinois, the returns of 1850 were rejected altogether for insufficiency. Letters from 
Kentucky entitled to high credit, state the water-rotted hemp for that year to be not a third 
as much as the census gives, and the dew-rotted to be about 22,000 tons. In this case the whole 
hemp crop of 1850 may have reached 35 or 40,000 tons, and that of 1840, 25 to 30,000 tons.f

There would have been little difficulty in framing a table like the following for all of the 
States, had time admitted, with other similar ones for cotton, sugar, rice, &c, showing the 
producers of under five bales, hogsheads, &c, between 5 and 10, 10 and 100, 100 and 500. 
The counties here selected have been taken at raadom, and represent, New England, the 
South and the "West, to wit: Franklin in Kentucky; Point Coupee, Ouachita, Rapides, Pla-

Of the cultivators embraced, one in 9 in Kentucky, one in 22 in Louisiana, one in 27/ in Rhode 
Island, one in 56 in South Carolina, and one in 198 in Michigan, cultivate less than ten acres. 
Of the larger cultivators. South Carolina and Louisiana show an excess. 

The latest returns of agriculture are for the crop of 1849. Consulting the Prices Current 
at the points of production and consumption, and forming the mean, a table of valuation has 
been prepared. The approximation is as near as can be arrived at.

By a special resolution of the Senate, the Census office was requested to furnish a statement 
showing the quantity of land cultivated in each of the agricultural staples of the country. 
The time was not sufficient for the collection of material necessary to prepare such a state- 
ment fully for the present volume, as an extensive correspondence would be required. By 
an examination of the marshals' returns, showing the average product to the acre in every 
county for a good crop, and the actual product in the year of the census, approximate data 
were obtained from which the following table was compiled. It is the best that can be offered, 
and is the only table of the kind ever published.

It would thus appear that the actual crops do not account for 17,24*7,614 acres, which are 
returned as being improved. It is possible the total reported as improved is exaggerated by a 
part of this difference, say 9,000,000 acres, which would leave about 8,000,000 for waste, yet 
improved- lands.f 



* Professor Tucker estimated the crop of 1840 at $654,387,597. It was no doubt nearer $800,000,000. 

t The New York State census of 1845 reports 11,757,276 acres improved land, a near approximation to 
the United States census of 1850. Of this amount only 3,851,594 were cultivated in barley, peas, beans, buck- 
wheat, turnips, potatoes, flax, wheat, corn, rye and oats, leaving nearly eight millions for meadows, bay, gar- 
dens, orchards, etc., and unaccounted for. The State reports of Ohio for "1851 show 1,677,253 acres in wheat, 
and 1,664,429 acres in corn. If the occupied land sustained tho same relation to the whole population in 1840

The table ■which follows is very incomplete, birt nothing better can be framed from the 
returns, which in general were very carelessly made or entirely neglected. 

and 1800 as in 1850. it would seem that 77,000,000 acres have been taken up^r brought into use in the last ten 
years, and 226.000,000 acres in the last fifty years. In the same period 4,129, /77 acres were brought into use in 
England.

There are in the Southern States 74,031 cotton plantations, including all producers of 
more than five bales, 2,681 sugar planters including the smallest; 551 estates making more 
than 20,000 pounds of rough rice each; 15,745 tobacco estates of 3,000 pounds each and over 
in Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia; 8,327 hemp planters in Kentucky and Missouri. Only 
such States are taken as are considered crop States. 

2. Manufactures. — The complete statistics of manufactures in the United States are being 
now aggregated from the returns of the census of 1850. They are no doubt quite as full and 
reliable as those of the census of 1810, 1820 or 1840, and perhaps more complete.* It will be 
very long before any country can expect entire accuracy in such reports, although by their 
means close and valuable approximations may be made. The heavy expense at which these 
statistics were obtained and the extensive ground which they cover entitle them to publication, 
and all chances of material error can be guarded against by appending to them notes of com- 
parison with the local reports of the several States, cities, associations, etc. 

* For example, in 1840, 6 or 8 importing merchants were given to Abbeville, S. C. where there was not in 
fact one, and in Boston $2,442,309 was given as the capital invested and $4,01 6,573 the product, though the State 
census of manufactures in 1839 reported $5,830,572 capital and $11,071,576 product in the same articles. The 
whole manufacturing product of the United States in 1810 was estimated at $172,000,000 and in 1840 about 
$500,000 r 0u0. 



MANUFACTURES. 



179 



The folio wing tables hare undergone a few revisions since their first preparation and 
are proper to be placed in the present volume. There are 121.855 establishments of every de- 
scription reported, producing each of any kind of manufactured article the amount annually 
of five hundred dollars. The capital invested in real and personal estate is $527. 209.193; the 
value of raw material used, including fuel, $55-4,655,038; the amount paid for labor, 
^229,736,377, and the gross annua! value produced Si. 013.336,463, making 43 per cent, profit 
upon the "whole investment The ratio of profits in the several States is also given, presenting 
some anomalies which cannot at present be reconciled. Those who will examine the manu- 
facturing returns of 1840 and 1820 will find still greater ones. The figures giving the numcer 
of hands employed and the value of annual product are no doubt entirely correct, the chances 
of error being mainly in the returns of the cost of raw material and the amount of capital 
invested. An average profit of 43 per cent, would not be too high for the whole industrial 
operations of the country. The number of hands employed of all ages was 719,479 males and 
225.512 females; total, 944.991. The County tables of this volume will show the amount of 
capital invested, the hands employed and the total product of every county in the United 
States, The motive power, as steam, horse, water, etc. was ascertained for each establishment 
requiring such, but has not been prepared in tabular form. As the examination of the Indus- 
trial schedules progresses it is probable many of the figures in the tables will be modified and 
corrected.

3. Commerce. — The statistics of the various branches of commerce in the several States, 
though ascertained by the census of 1340, were omitted among the items of that of 1850, 
except as to the number of persons employed and the nature of the business employing 
them. There were in 1S50 100.752 merchants proper, and 14.917 traders, if reliance can be 
placed on the figures, which is doubtful. Prof. Tucker from the returns, estimated the annual 
product from commerce in 1840 at S97,721,036 : $40,680,081, or more than half being: for the 
Middle State?. Sl3.528.740 for the Xew England. $11,967,281 for the South. $14,255,964 for 
the South-west, aud S17. 289.020 for the North-west Without doubt the figures are low. It 
would be fair to estimate the home and foreign commerce of the United States in 1850 at 
$1,500,000,000.* paying a profit of 20 per cent, or §300,000,000, or more than the profits of 
manufactures. However these are but mere hypotheses. 

The following statistics are presented as a proper and necessary appendage to the Industrial 
Report of the census. They have been carefully collected in the office from official sources, or such 
as are regarded official, as Seybert, Pitkins, Hazard. «fcc. and will give in a condensed form all 
that can be desired here in relation to the early and growing commerce of the Colonies. States, 

* The Western River commerce has been estimated at $339.502.744 : Lake and River commerce together, 
$653,976,202. (Comings Report on Steam Marine of the Interior.) If half the agricultural products and all of 
the manufacturing wpre subjects of commerce, the whole commercial movement misht be estimated at be- 
tween 61 .500.000.000 and .^-OOO.OOO.OOO. Mr. Walker, in his Treasury Report of 1847, estiniatrd the whole pro- 
ducts of the country at -63,000,000,000 annually. §300,000,000 profit in commerce would be less than §3,000 to 
each of the 100,752 merchants reported in 1850

* •'< During tbe war of the Revolution, our commerce was suspended ; after the peace in 1763, our trade con- 
tinued to languish; it had to contend with domestic and foreign obstacles ; .foreign nations entertained a 
jealousy concerning these States ; at home a rivalship was prevalent amongst the several members of the con- 
federacy, and checked the prosperity of the nation. Each of the thirteen independent sovereignties contem- 
plated its own immediate interests ; some of the States declared the commercial intercourse with them to be 
equally free to all nations, and they cautiously avoided to lay duties on such merchandize as was subject to 
them, when imported into other States."

In Great Britain 7,666 miles of railway in 1553 were open to traffic, and charters existed for 2.164 miles 
more ; in 1850, 625 miles were opened, in 1853, 350 miles. Total capital invested 1652, £264.165,630. Total 
passengers conveyed, 102.286,650. Total receipts from all sources, £18,635,879. In France, 1853^ there were 
4.070 kilometres (f of a mile, 1,093 yards) of railroad in operation, 1890 under construction, and 3.665 proposed. 
Dr. Lardner estimated the railroads opened in the world in 1845, 18,656, and in construction 7,629, with a total 
capital of about £500.000,000. A late French authority, 1554', states the miles of railroad in Europe to bo 
52,011 kilom. of which 45.569 were opened. The relation of the governments to each other with regard to 
railroads and in proportion to territorv, is expressed iu the figures. France 0.77, Prussia 1.06. smaller German 
States 1.30. Belgium 3.06, Great Britain 3.91. 

The number of miles of railway now in operation upon the surface of the globe is 35,480. of which 16,890 
are in the Eastern Hemisphere, and 18,590 are in the Western; and which are distributed as follows : 

In the United States 17,317 miles, British Provinces 823, Island of Cuba 359. Panama 31. South America 60* 
Great Britain 7,686, Germany 5,340, France 2,480, Belzium 532, Russia 422, Sweden 75, Italy 170, Spain 60,

PART V. 
PROPERTY, REVENUE, TAXATION, &c. 

The value of real and personal estate in the United State-! in 1850 was $7,066,562,986. Supposing this to be 
correct, and estimating the increase since that time to have averaged as much as in Kentuckv. which in 1S53 
was -8366,957,487, the total in 1554 would be upwards of g7.50u.000.000 for the official and' $9,000,000,000 
for the real. This is but an approximation, as the taxable property is only included, which in all of the States 
i« greatly less than the whole. The real estate in farms alone, as was seen in another place, amounted m 
value to §3,271,575,426 in 1850. From the official report of States and cities, collected indepsndentlv of the

An attempt was made by the Census to ascertain the amount paid for Taxes in the U. States, but the returns 
are very incomplete. The following is the best that can be digested from the returns and embraces but a part of 
the States. The total of taxation in these States appears to be $25,055,129. Estimating the same proportion in 
the other States, the total would be swelled to about $43,000,000, or including federal taxes about $83,000,000, an 
average of $4.24 to each white person or $3.58 to each inhabitant. In 1832 the Secretary of State collected ma- 
terial upon this subject, which was embodied not long after in a full report. Upon averaging a few States fully 
returned, he estimated the amonnt paid by each individual for clergy, road building, militia, poor rates, town ex- 
penses, schools, county, state and federal expenses together at $2.55; excluding clergy, road and militia, $2.15.

cipal and interest.

estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury as held by foreigners. 

For all marked thus ( el) the revenue, expenditure and debt are taken from official replies to inquiries — all 
others are from the American Almanac, 1853. In several States the personal property is estimated from par 
tial returns.

The total number of real estate holders in theU. State?, uponarough estimate from the returns of two or three 
States which were examined, cannot fall short of 1,500,000, or one to 3.19 of the free males over 21 years of age. 

In the counties of the following States, which are named upon page 153, the real estate holders are thus 
classified : In Connecticut .$215,535 in real estate were owned by free blacks, and $88,000 by mulattoes, total 
§303,535; in Louisiana .$311,465 by free blacks, and .$3,958,830 by free mulattoes, total $4,270,295 ; XewYork 
city, owned by mulattoes $44,000, by blacks $65,310 ; New Orleans, including Lafayette, mulattoes $1,991,050, 
blacks .^222.970 ; in Barnwell, Beaufort, and Charleston, S. C, 58 free colored owned under $1,000 each iu 
real estate, 10 between $1,000 and $5,000 each, 2 between $5,000 and $10,000, etc.

Indians. — The number of Indians within the territory of the United States was stated by General Knox, 
Secretary of War, to be 76,000 in 1789. In eonseajrence of annexation of new territory, notwithstanding the 
extinction of tribes, the whole number in 1825 reported by the Indian Department, was 129,366, exclusive of 
those in the Missouri valley, &c. In 1853 the present commissioner of Indian Affairs estimated the total 
number at 400,764, of which 271,930 were in California, Oregon, Texas, &.c, and therefore not embraced in 
1828. This would show a decline of 532 upon the number then existing. The names of tribes and past and 
present locations will be seen on page 94, quarto census. The following are the numbers of some of the 
largest tribes in 1853: Creeks of [ndian country, 25 ,000; Cherokees of Indian country, 19,130; Choctaws of 
Indian country, 17,000 ; Sioux of Minnesota, 8,000 ; Chippewas of Minnesota, 8,000 ; California Indians, 100.000 ; 
Oregon and Washington Indians, 23.000; Utah Indians, 11.500 ; New Mexico Indians, 45,000; Texas' Indians, 
29,000 ; Missouri Valley Indians, 43,430 ; Arkansas River Indians, 20,000.

PAET VI 



CITIES, TOWNS, COUNTIES, &c. 

The Census does not furnish material for separating the urban and rural population 
of the United States, so as to admit of a statement showing the extent of either. Such a table 
to each of the States would be very valuable, and it is much to be regretted that it can be 
deduced from none of the census publications. 

So imperfect is the Census of 1850 in this respect that hundreds of important towns and 
cities in all parts of the country, and especially in the South and West, are not even distinguished 
on the returns from the body of the counties in which they are situated, and therefore their 
population cannot be ascertained at all. Again, slaves are often included in the towns, 
simply because their owners reside there. But what is of more importance and the greatest 
pause of embarrassment is the fact that in New England and the Northern States, what aref 
returned as cities, and towns, often include whole rural districts. If the information in re- 
gard to town and city population is ever to be correctly ascertained, there must be explicit 
instructions to separate upon the returns, distinctly, all places having an aggregation of over 
fifty or a hundred persons, with a store, tavern, blacksmith shop or school house and post 
office, or some or all of these, and to include within such village, town or city, no person not 
resident within its limits proper. It would not be difficult to frame suitable instructions upon 
this point

In Richmond the number of persons to a dwelling in 1850 averaged 5.2. Charleston 5.6, 
Mobile 5.8, New Orleans 6.5, Philadelphia 6.6, Baltimore 6.9, St. Louis 7.7, Cincinnati 8.2, Bos- 
ton 8.9, New York 13.6. In the whole embraced "within the corporate limits of Mobile there 
are 1.6 persons to the acre, in Washington 7.2, St. Louis 26.3, Cincinnati 30.0, New York, 42.2, 
Boston 53.9 ; in the portions of these cities actually and fully settled, the number to the acre "was 
as follows : Mobile 13.8, New Orleans 45.4. Cincinnati 45.0, St. Louis 47.4. Philadelphia 80.0, Bos- 
ton 82.7, New York 135.6. In 30 years Charleston in 1850 had increased 73 per cent. Savannah 
103, Baltimore 169, Philadelphia 198, Boston 221, Providence 252. New York 316, Xew Orleans 
328, Louisville 976, Cincinnati 1097: in 20 years the increase of Richmond was 71. Nashville 
82, Mobile 542. Chicago 570, Milwaukie 1071, St. Louis 1464. In an average period of about 
30 years the increase of European cities in 1852 had been as follows: Amsterdam 15 per cent, 
Copenhagen 22. Naples 23, St. Petersburg 42, Madrid 43, Paris 47, Brussels 69, Yienna and 
London 91, Berlin 134. 

The population of 17,150 places was ascertained by the British census of 1851 — 10.929 by the 
L T . S. census 1850. 815 towns in Great Britain contained 10,556,228 persons, or one-half 
nearly of the whole population. In the United States it may be assumed that the village, 
town and city population includes about one-fourth of the whole. There were, in 1850, 
2,500,000 persons resident of cities exceeding 20,000 each, and the aggregate of tables CCXYI 
and CCXYII is about 3,000,000. The rural population might be ascertained by multiplying the 
number of farms into the average persons existing upon each. Other statistics of cities will 
be found in previous chapters and in the appendix. 

NOTES ON THE COUNTY TABLES WHICH FOLLOW. 

The table of counties which follows will show for 1850 the whites, free colored and slave, and the total in 
1840, (the male and female of the colored can be ascertained by deducting those of the whites from the total- 
males and females there given.) the nativities of the white and free colored born out of the State and in the 
United States or in foreign countries, the dwellings and the families of the free population, the pupils, white 
and colored, and income of public schools and of all other schools and colleges as returned by institutions, and 
also of whites as returned by families, the whites between 5 and 20 years of age, the whites over 20 unable to 
read and write, the number of persons for whom there are church accommodation, the number of farms, the 
quantity and value of lands and implements, the stock and agricultural products, the manufactures produced 
in families, with the capital, hands employed and annual product of establishments as contradistinguished from 
families, including all mechanical pursuits, &c. in shcqps where the annual value of product at the place of 
manufacture exceeds $500. 

The blanks indicate that nothing has been returned by the marshals, whether from its non-existence, from the 
impossibility of ascertaining the facts, or from neglect or oversight. 

The remarks upon counties denote such changes as have taken place between 1840 and 1850 in their organi- 
zation or boundaries, so as to estimate the true increase. 

The agsregates of the columns will be found in the tables by States in the former part of the volume, and 
could not be inserted here without widening the columns, and increasing unnecessarily the extent of the work. 

Out of 1,626 counties in the United States in 1850.480 had been created or altered in the previous ten years— 
in 54 the females greatly preponderated, 155 the slaves and in 7 the foreign born. In 441 counties there were 
few or no foreigners; in 20 counties the native and foreign were about equal. In 1,023 counties there were 
slaves ; in 192 there were no free colored.

POPULATION 

OF SUCH 

CITIES, TOWNS, TOWNSHIPS, HUNDREDS, &c, IN THE UNITED STATES, 

AS HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED AT THE CENSUS OFFICE. 

The letter T affixed to a place designates the town in the township, &c. of the same name 
in the same county. "Bor." is an abbreviation of borough. The asterisk (*) is placed wher- 
ever the slave population cannot be defined, and is therefore not included; and the obelisk (|) 
wherever there is probability that slaves owned in, but not residents of, the town, are included. 

Towns, the population of which is ascertained from other sources than the census schedules, 
are put in italics, and the figures are generally for 1853 or 1854.

*Sex not given ; included in the aggregate of counties. 

t Nevada County. — " 3,886," " foreign residents over twenty-one years," are Chinese, not separated as to 
sex, included in the aggregate. 

\ Placer County. — The aggregate includes 3,019 Chinese, not given in preceding columns. 

§ Sacramento County. — In the aggregate are included 804 Chinese, not in the other columns. 

|| It is not stated if these Indians are domesticated ; as is also the case in some other instances. 

il Yuba County. — The aggregate includes 2,100 Chinese, not given in the preceding columns. 

** The aggregate, as published in the California State report, differs very much from the above, although 
the same detailed work was used in both cases. The following are the State figures : Total population of 
California, 224,435— county of Butte, 8,572 ; Calaveras, 20,192 ; Colusi, 620 ; Contra Costa, 2,745 ; *E1 Dorado, 
not returned ; Klamath, 530 ; Los Angeles, 7,831 ; Marin, 1,036 ; Mariposa, 8,969 ; Mendocino, 416 ; Monterey, 
2,728; Napa, 2,116; Nevada, 21,365; Placer, 10,784; Sacramento, 12,589; San Diego, 2,932; San Joaquin,

1,764 ; Tuolumne, 17,657 ; Tulare, 8,575 ; Yolo, 1,307 ; Yuba, 22,005. There are many inconsistencies in the 
aggregates, and it has been almost impossible to frame a table from them. 

* El Dorado is presumed to contain 40,000 inhabitants.
